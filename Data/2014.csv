outerra anteworld  hrtf binaural audio test
""
sweet  outerra awesome  hope get multiplayer soon  s lonely xd
m envisioning world campers fps games actually sit completely still irl order hearddetected  like 
never heard outerra anteworld encourage check videos youtube  native rift support addition binaural audio could become one best demos show vr capable  although currently rather simulation game 
nt terribly impressive ears  although certainly sounded  better  hrtf turned   sounded practically monophonic prior   case   many hrtf algorithms  sound  appeared  rise forehead  instead passing directly front  believe sound also dipped downwards bit passed behind head  although subtle effect  frontback cues seemed fairly weak  height cues essentially nonexistent   nt mean poor job   stuff seems super  personalized  given person s ear holes  nt seem convincing  nt mean particular algorithm could nt work fabulously well someone else  also  head tracking added mix  sort thing work much better everyone 
sound engine  works really well least 
found similar videos  watching outerra  http  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vloovx68wbl4  modern engine quake 3 supporting hrtf  written scratch   object  pascal    http  wwwpascalgamedevelopmentcomshowthreadphp  13795brtech1 
impressive 
fixed scale problem   maybe ipd adjustment  dont know exactly tested demo didnt found much impresive  native support  
sounded pretty good  hoping start see binaural audio lot games software improves 
sounds great 71 surround sound headset 
doubt people camp games would play game like though  m realistic games  love true vr ideals everyone  though playing something stupid mindless like cod fun  nfs  love racing sims  sometimes s fun go play burnout 
s tech demo nt  behind times  gameelements 
interactive demo  headtracking  find brain adapts  virtual ears  course several cumulative hours  due feedback loop audio visual  frontback reversals occur less often  height discrepancy clear 
listening  oh open headphones good soundstage could clearly hear eyes closed  though might right height cues strong  must consider open environment flat ground  worked extremely well headphones  overall  important vr 
try    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  viikdhuczby  see whether red green version sounds better  different people different ear shapes head resonances  different versions algorithm software uses kind audio  take differences account  nt know outerra going plan providing options re luck 
wan na know find http  youtubeiudtlvagjja hrtf microphones head made ballistics something similar 
believe openal
scale problem  sure thinking right demo  outerra ability adjust ipd long time 
71 headsets pure marketing gimmick  high quality stereo headsets  binaural beats shit 71 headsets junk 
tech demo  real gameelements  download demo version  http  wwwouterracomdemohtml
throw example support theory  anytime wear hat re dramatically changing ears localize sound  yet become accustomed new head  shape forget re wearing hat  another thing note  one thing notice sort 3d graphics hrtf demonstrations audio positioning matched according rendered fov  generally monitor occupying much much smaller fov  results substantial mismatch ears eyes placing truck  need move face quite close monitor get sync  would venture guess watched loop even minutes d start hear noticeable improvement  testing different hrtf openal models always made sure close eyes  brain potentially funny things trying place source sound ca nt see  thinks  
 closed headphones height cues also worked  guess s person person thing whether works 
forgot playing minute got freaked fuck lol  
real binaural  recording   sure  demo s pseudo binaural audio nt sound anywhere close ears 
 testing different hrtf openal models always made sure close eyes  brain potentially funny things trying place source sound ca nt see  thinks   good point bring  keeping eyes open common cause hearing everything behind listening recording  senses need reinforce  otherwise ll confuse 
sound  vision  360° video 360° binaural audio beck s david bowie cover   s nonstereoscopic  used rift sundance year

 music video  non360 mix  look 3d binaural microphones  look like human heads many ears  pretty cool  http  wwwhelloagaincombeck360mainvideohtml  makingofvideo concert recording rigs http  nowlincolncom201302soundtechnologygetsahumantouch binaural audio vr please 
oh gosh  thank  m saving sure  really ca nt wait see else comes musical community rift 
s nice practice filmmaker interested vr film see 360 video contrasted linear cut bottom right  wonder  though  360 video resolution bad  probably used two full hd cams stitched together 360 video cam respectively 
sorry  guys  m bit confused  riftcompatible version publicly available point 
ya go  http  wwwyoutubecomuserdddysonvideos ones labeld oculus lens distortion set rift viewing 
actually using gopro cameras 360 view  see hanging  human head  microphones  believe rig  stitching comes http  www360heroscom

bad  s quite aureallevel  got ta start somewhere re going revive 3d audio industry  nice work guys  watch creative get popular 
waiting time  major props work  huge  definitely bring feedback messing bit 
downloading 
binaural different stereo  stereo good enough vr 
application sent  interested try  think re going need actual path tracing though get truly realistic sound simulation 
nothing pleases seeing audio addressed vr   
thanks comment guys  s incredibly encouraging  share dev  download  play around give us honest feedback  thank much 
finally  another step towards presence 
sounds really great  integrate unity 
love  really must vr 
ideally  hrtf user profile along ipd  height  sex  plan universal hrtf  user selectable 
nt know problem  hrtf demos ve tried sounds looks like coming behind  know s hardest part get since s dependent ear shape  maybe peruser calibration possible get right 
looks awesome  looking plug like unity  thanks work releasing free alpha 
really needed  vr sdir promising never released  awesome 
really nice  open source 
look forward giving spin  thanks 
hi  tried  keeps popping quiet loud back  something wrong  even moving camera  windows 81 64bit  plays 10 seconds correctly  pops loud  plays sound nonspatialized  plays muted spatialized  idea sounds interesting  pun intended   stage  unusable 
awesome work  m imagining nt let go redone 
thank  go iomoon sure  work sectr audio  maybe thats covered  excited reply  edit  listening demo  blown away  going huge world  going asap  thank
super stoked flood emails  people trying  people giving constructive feedback egging us go  ca nt express much means us  also  product  realise might bit careful limitations evaluation version  monday  release update removes   time outbypass effect   hear binaural effect time  limit 2 active audio sources  bound change time time things move forward  wanted take care annoyance lot complained  actually great feedback – thank much   everyone asked pricing  ve decided make free use noncommercial projects  limitation 5 audio sources   get touch project details ll provide license  commercial projects release price structure within next ten days  sorry figures mention right currently sorting licensing details lawyer post website  competitive  also flexible options since tough onesizefitsall approach within games industry  developing games always find tough fit pricing structures needs  want get right would appreciate hang days  committed delivering product makes sense everybody — technically qualitatively commercially well 
cool  looking forward hearing reports devs rifters 
tested head tracking rift yet 
 deleted 
makes happy 
weird  googling around today wondering nt common games 
finally  shouting rooftops  telling every programmer meet make exactly 2 years 
looking long time  thanks creating  downloading  youtube demo reminds drone starwars empire strikes back 
different effects obtained something like dolby headphone  takes 8 channel surround sound converts binaural stereo   effects dolby headphone pretty good nt deal vertical sound well  nt actually remember works  might assume something appears front back channels always something like   want know much better could beis s already  s minor improvement m excited s major difference 
sounds pretty good  licencing costs small indie studio 34 seats 
already another great binaural sound engine  gsound  http  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vbuu8gpg2chi   http  gammacsuncedugsound   http  gammacsuncedugsound   http  gammacsuncedugsound  iswill system differnt better compared 
hello fantastic people  let know ve released new build  3dception   http  twobigearscom    ve removed time limit evaluation version  packages include prebuilt examples osx  windows linux — including support oculus rift  bug fixes  noncommercial licenses free  get touch  thanks lot invaluable feedback guys 
first  great  something like really important vr  question  unreal engine 4 kind available everyone price 20   consider bringing unreal engine 4 soon  m going work unreal engine 4 3d audio would amazing   
given recent ue4 release s popularity  think might also make plugin ue4  know others would appreciative 
absolutely fantastic  definitely one missing pieces vr puzzle  ll downloading integrating projects weekend  thanks 
incredibly important vr  great people working type work  nt feel like example virtual barbershop demo yet hear effects  looking forward toward  
looks really nice  ll need learn unity play around 
precompiled unity demo anywhere  s linux unitypackage download s linux unity sdk  s way use 
sounds really good  unity integration big plus  would definitely like use 
cool  definitely help make vr experiences even intimate  guess unity people use  would udk something would consider beta  thanks making happen  somebody already said  awesome vr related news today 
handle echoes complex geometry  check video example mean  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vmqt1jtdbnk4
wonder tech handle complex sounds  like hear noise coming inside large pipe standing  would sound complexity  hear sound center pipe ends  tech work within line sight 
yay 
compare  dolby headphone   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vl9apnlmmeas   use often works game surround support

start working exact thing  save lot time haha  p awesome work guys
big believer power spatial audio  particularly relates vr  possibly quick feature comparison 3dception  nowfree fmod package   http  wwwgamasutracomviewnews212696fmodstudioaudiotoolsnowcompletelyfreeforindiesphp   thanks 
big fan push get 3d audio games  questions hrtfs   high resolution   many come builtin   developer use custom hrtfs   enduser use custom hrtfs  thanks  good luck 
looks cool  going try project 
hey  nice start  plan resolve different hrtf modelshead shapes  far seems biggest problem 3d audio  really individual 
wondering would invented  haha  demo sounds perfect  ca nt wait use maxmsp  maybe ableton live  edit  saw demo
awesome  someone mentioned surround sound headphones another place comments  work better  would user notice difference surround sound stereo headphones 
awesome  protocol openal supported details  like environment  rather canned effects  could get essentially every linux game  happy see moving forward 
hey  might conflict something going audio engine  sure   https  developeroculusvrcomforumsviewtopicphp  f37  t6764  p93994  p93994
like holophonics digital age  great work 
one best ve seen 
hi  published licensing details  commercial version available april 14th transition beta  details  http  twobigearscompricinghtml also published quick post blog summarising upcoming plans work far  http  twobigearscomlabs3dceptionsofar downloaded alpha build get update week improvements bug fixes  thanks patience support downloads feedback  questions feel free email us  hello   twobigears  dot  com   cheers varuntwo big ears
s good see finally coming around seeing reemergence true 3d audio  created short rift demo demonstrating beneficial tech vr immersion  download try  http  bitly1dscqfk
hello guys  transitioned beta commercial noncommercial versions available download  website   http  twobigearscom   download  give spin  let us know think  thanks support far 
maan  searching days something like  little robot behind back head gives creeps  amazing work guys  adds much realism  optinion sound underestimated thing games  m mournin good old xfi card  use little noncommercial project maybe darkfield  
downloadable demo site definitely provides better frontback definition interactive  although still run little confusion  usually pockets  30 degrees azimuth  30 sagittal plane   binaural feels little distinct  m really curious  m wondering also guys following recent hrtf work re microsoft  ve heard  re crunching huge data sets hundreds live subjects  think taking measurements massive scale like make significant difference quality algorithm 
check one  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v05el5sumee 3d audio 
d love see demo includes different kinds spaces  audio types  outdoor vs indoor small room vs medium room vs large room many sounds ones  like street ny many sounds ones  like walling orchestra environmental sounds  like thunder storm beach high cliffs crickets grass field different kinds sounds  people talking  music  high sounds  low sounds  deep sounds  light sounds  basey sounds  sounds  gun shots  explosions  sound get effected moving  objects around move blocking sounds  causing echoes  extra 
agreed  knew dk2 coming eventually  sort blue think quite often  ll try unity get home 
 deleted 
would love see small unity demo test head rotation  would bet adds lot 
seem like holographicbinaural difficult time making things seem like front  demo barber shop  everything behind  top left right  never really front  maybe brain messed 
think ll hard anything live brtf trueaudio  ca nt wait get hold card supports 
yes  wary  hope community benefit greatly push resurgence high quality audio  future sounds bright 
binaural audio dreadhalls 
stereo nt good enough ca nt use judge source sound ear  never mattered gaming level audio realism unnecessary looking flat monitor  vr  need able use ears way real life  god news player nt need special earphones  matters recording end also create true 3d sound alters player avatar moves  stereo works altering volume  binaural works altering generation sound ear closer ear virtual sound source  hear sound first 
stereo positional sound geometrical matter  sometimes tricks like lowhighpass filters fixed reverbechoflanger simulate environment  binaural takes account much complex model human ear environment  hear much physically correct  rather  less physically incorrect  p   literally  feel  sound source located space around 
add people said  head  big cantaloupe meat bone  dampens sound hits one side  therefore left ear hears sound much differently right ear  depending sound coming  binaural audio  exceptions like astrosound  recorded using dummy head two microphones  sound therefore head dampening effect makes realistic  things going  understanding  one keys earie realism 
binaural stereo true stereo 
could use surround sound headphones get every game 
hi  check website  fill details click download  providing detailed documentation along example projects alpha library well  thank much 
question exactly  crucial part enable user specify head shapehrtf least select based cleverly manufactured guide  universal hrtf never justice  imo  
 deleted 
high list trying multiple solutions  important get right ux perspective well — setup steps possible setup  progress alpha news   varun  3dception 
hello  problem plugin well  frontback localisation well documented error  usually happens hrtf used nt match hrtf  real life  usually get rid moving head ever slightly  help case since head orientation tracked real time  thanks 
massive well done   
hello  read emaildocumentation correctly  released feature limited alpha version  since continuous development happening  thanks trying would really appreciate feedback incorporate future updates  binaural effect switching onoff feature limitation  sorry  anything wrong   thanks 
m also getting issue look sphere front  hear behind  still  theres ton potential  watching  thanks 
yes  makes us super excited  hope devs pick make amazing experiences 
hi sinoth  right  hrtf processing happening  managed sneak spatialised early reflections well  something test download package   aiming high quality efficient audio without burning cpu  considering targeting mobile builds near future well  unity demo comes room modeller prefab  customise room sizes  absorption coefficents  well  hope helped 
little company good binaural technology  patents match  creative falsely sued point file bankruptcy  point creative bought  also gave access said patents  trolling anyone tries anything binaural gaming since  http  wwwredditcomrtruegamingcomments126fjpwhyisntbinauralaudiousedingaming
posted  still drilling flexible licensing plan works everybody  small dev team aware constraints  get touch us email  keep loop  releasing licensing structure soon  next two weeks done implementing constructive feedback receiving waves  shall   thanks bearing us 
silence might mean expensivetoo much small teams 
thanks  ue4 support roadmap  hopefully get commercial release  stay tuned 
plans motion support many relevant platforms possible  support means lot us  keep watching space 
package downloads come example projects  precompiled binaries  complete documentation play around well  
near future  definitely  alpha release primarily targeting unity first  moving platforms  udk something would definitely like release  cheers 
moment  handles spatialised early reflections rectangular rooms  dimensions  currently room prefab unity plugin placed anywhere   complex geometry feature list  incorporated point time 
mind kind blown  m imagining playing game re going caves  know sound accurate  re unfamiliar sound bounces might trouble tracing  would make great mazeambush effect tell coming might know   mostly thinking things like underdark forgotten realms  ra salvatore describes drizzt s adventures

hello  thanks comment  idea encouraging us get positive feedback  ca nt divulge much tech right  tell resolution hrtf incredibly high fraction computational cost traditional algorithms  point time  user upload customhrtf s s definitely future feature list  currently  aiming full scale commercial beta release soon  beyond big feature list help 3dception evolve time  fit developer s needs  hope helped

thanks heads  responded post   varun  twobigears 
thanks kind words  looking forward  hearing  real projects
definitely  prebuilt oculus demo coming next week — varun  tbe 
describe result two factors  first recorded demos ca nt move head  actually important auditory localisation tool  move heads  slight unconscious movements  auditory scene follows ie  fixed heads  sound tends collapse heads  headphones  second eyes stepping telling possible way sound re hearing infront  clearly wall  brain steps point dictates sound source location must behind  acoustic world called fronttoback confusion  fact oculus allows move head also provide visual stimulus required  brain believes sound distance front  visual input receiving open field  example  holy grail  acoustician  bought dev kit  alas  time develop  rift  try demonstration  prerecorded feedback head movements nt demonstrate full potential  glimpse   try keep head still oculuswearing playback  first  watch video headphones watching monitor  notice moves front  unconvincing  second  strap rift play  m sure  difference huge  frontal localisation  s also like like texture sound changed  like sound moving arm physical presence  m keen hear similar experience  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vlsxh5etsxds ca nt wait see 3dception others applied rift games  staying tuned 
shape outer ear huge amount impact whether perceive sounds come front behind  one reason traditional stereo audio ideal vr  binaural recording set ups use microphones mounted inside fake ears  m sure done within game engine maybe quite right  unfortunately give go get home s working people others could shape ears brain used perceiving audio based shape   source aural perception   http  enwikipediaorgwikisoundlocalization  soundlocalizationinthemedianplane28front2cabove2cback2cbelow29 
mostly  bat ears  probably nt help  hopefully one day option  hope kinnect scan model ears  software model audio changes realtime  though sounds crazy complex 
 heard one time demo actually sounded like sound coming front 
headset dolby 3d stuff builtin problem  also demo videos   stuff front seems inside head   
 deleted 
sure hope valve takes something like wing  seem patron saint neglected technology lately 
 watch creative get popular big one  understand  creative holds patent idea  uabeshius getting around issue 
maybe  audio quality quite important immersion  vr horror games  m willing give try
agree said except nt matter  made huge difference back day  aureal 3d run business frivolous lawsuits creative labs  promptly bought tech let collect dust years unused products  ve limping along ever since far 3d audio goes  remember much crazy difference made though  especially firstperson shooters 
m sure  agree binaural improvement  play counterstrike competitively always tell someone headphones  definitely kill people without needing look screen occasionally  nt agree  ca nt use judge source sound ear   sure 
important aspect  stereo never sounds right  ca nt tell someone say counter strike bellow normal stereo  binaural  go  hey dudes right    check http  wwwyoutubecomwatch  viudtlvagjja understand m talking  sense presence binaural audio wayyyyyyy stereo 
could nt thing done stereo two mics side dummy head  nt see benefit binaural  thought main point binaural audio modelisation ears  simulate reflection sound  ve yet heard example made difference compared stereo  remember tested barber s demo intras earphones could nt really tell source sound front behind 
surround sound headphones binaural  surround sound headphones binaural sound 3d tv oculus rift 
binaureal sound    whatever s called   also gives height information  basically surround sound headphones fake sound sources horizontal circle around head binaureal sound fake sphere around head 
guess issue  unlike parameters  choosing optimal hrtf currently subjective process  selection screen could feature animation soundemitting object orbiting head  user selects hrtf sounds accurate  good enough  auditory implications specific pinnae geometry yet precise science 
addition points abeshius  frontback confusion also due visual input matching auditory input  brain says  dinosaur front  wall  must behind  rift feeding correct visual stimulus  think frontback confusion reduced  additionally recent research looked fast brain learn new hrtf  result relatively short time period  listener accurate different hrtf  think research also fixed head positions  m interested know much faster new hrtf learnt head movement believable visual stimulus provided rift   hello  problem plugin well  frontback localisation well documented error  usually happens hrtf used nt match hrtf  real life  usually get rid moving head ever slightly  help case since head orientation tracked real time  thanks 
problem capyvara  nt know plugin demo video sound mostly behind inside head  eyes closed could sworn ending sequence taking place behind head  demo app select different hrtfs  edit  wanted say specific software case  every 3d audio demo video tried also headset  dolby headphone 71  
hi  sorry  bad  glanced documentation get work  would nice ramp volume insteadof switching though  almost lost ears might come bit rough  result nice  idea would eventually like charge 
thank much  yes  issue tracker alive kicking   hoping lots feedback take care releasing final version  product sounds really interesting btw  good luck 
considered using kinnect something similar scan ears  model sound around 
ahh s wonderful  good luck things  thanks 
nt  example package s binaries 
nt mean 3dception wo nt support fmod future    varun  two big ears 
thanks reply   limited  research indicates least partially inaccurate  supposedly fmod package used unity  gimped   something using  real  hrtf algorithms   otherwise fmod seems  capable spatial features   http  wwwkvraudiocomproductfmodexbyfirelighttechnologies    supply 3d positions sound source listener fmod ex automatically apply volume  filtering  surround panning doppler effect mono  stereo even multichannel samples  transition calculated positioning sound designer defined positioning using 2d3d pan morphing  even greater audio realism use fmod ex s    choice linear  logarithmic custom rolloff curves   custom geometry engine add polygon scenes  fmod ex factor obstructionocclusion    3d reverbs blend transitions environments different ambience   software mixer even hrtf   headrelated transfer function  mode provide 3d realism headphones    3dception fmod  significant optimization difference  probably deal fmod anyway access fancy audio functions  3dception give additional features  ll definitely exploring unity projects would benefit  serious torque3d projects  engine fmod already baked  seems old news 
thanks  great reply  really want give try friend s dev kit  fan rift holographicbinaural audio  ca nt wait see people develop 
yes  feedback eyes ears crucial  experiments last year new rift  little game scoring quick accurate location object  course week scoring kept getting better frontback confusion disappeared  brain adapted kemar  ears  proper training loop  visual confirmation audio cues  think  stress  situation gamey aspect helped push faster training well 
3dception  head tracking something else 
problem frontback rdamnrooster experiencing linked video  oculus video linked longtime cmss3d use  always assumed mismatches hrtf  average  head used situations vs personal hrtf big  weirdo head different  however  introduced new cold  hard science nt aware  p nt rift test video thought next best thing would close eyes see difference watching video avoid issue eyes mentioned  definitely noticed better eyes closed feels like hear fine around 2  oclock 10  oclock 111 suddenly feels like flips back head goes behind  ve noticed exact effect 360 degree helicopter demo comes cmss3d  likely part hrtf mismatch mentioned

yes please  oh man  excited full dreadhalls release  m torn hoping another demo  hoping re dedicating time making complete game ready launch title cv

s realistic  real life hear sound reached 2 ears time  wo nt know instinctively rotate head slightly determine true location  ca nt barbershop recording  vr headset adjusts movement head 
sure  actual  multiple speakers somehow inferior fake multiple speakers  d consider tech far closer 3d tv tech surround sound 
though  one faked   one requires special support effort developer chunk processing power  works games  videos music box  m saying ca nt useful  m saying people fawning saying  last immersion  bit silly point

yeah  actually matters  part allows accurate positional audio exactly attenuating sound traveled the human ear   necessarily  ear funny shape wo nt attenuated correctly 
right m working full time making full dreadhalls  also ideas new different demos  necessarily horror ones   might take days point prototype one

sure talking video  m talking  official demo video linked op   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  veyt7wfasyg0  visual cues  eg  20 seconds see flying thing right  yes barber shop visual clues damnrooster problem videos   way  also   backwards headphone syndrome  damnrooster hear sound directions one  would nt backwards headphones rotate sound perception directions 180°   nt downvote btw

getting lots judder desk screen video playing m 75fps  stops scene goes dark glasses come  everything else smooth minor judder scene changes  fyi  awesome demo though  windows 7 i74970k gtx 970
looks pretty damn cool  eta linux version 
thank amazing update  contratz award     
sweet  ca nt wait try 
i5 750  32ghz  r9280x  sdk 042 judder mostly whole demo  tried everything get better chance  version works nearly perfect  anyway  thank fantastic experience  love number one demo show first time rifters  sorry english    
judder 75hz  something wrong  seems like last update broke something dude  please fix  want binaural sound  seems classic 043 sdk issue  also ca nt get run directly rift  drag window across rift window  annoying white line top view
great stuff froox  alternative download mirrors  every time download  s speed pretty slow 
added feature make configuration file parts demo want play  order play 
awesome  tried integrate 3dception ago believe troubles  convincing get work though  downloading ll report back   full year thinking nvidia 660ti  reality s 560ti   pretty low end  recall  ever got serious judder beginning desk scene  curious see works better honestly nt  means nothing  560ti ooooold even close representative average rift user 
removed  making connection 17319465102 running 
m relatively new oculus  demo first one blow away  really came different angle demo s shows possible vr  s goto giving people first oculus experience 
thank youuu   
yay  thank  3 m sure horror story demo  everyone s horror games vr  m interested  prefer explore areas largely unexplored 
cpu gpu  problem  typical judder either  like every second 3 4 frame delay edit  seems happening video playback monitor  rest butter smooth far 
 intense  massive  painful judder desk scene  4790kgtx980  fps never drops 70  usually sits 7374 
strange  quality setting using  work fine 042 sdk 
 judder desk scene nt  w8  970m  i74710hq still great work frooxius  voted steam greenlight  
 running demo direct mode get 40 fps  extended mode 70 judder  also set quality fastest  mirror body  may slow computer  upgrade     
""
overclocked i73770k ivy bridge gtx980 one cpu cores maxing   may need man buy new cpumobo
awesome  thank showing others 
thanks feedback  people seem report judder  time suspect s new oculus sdk  try different quality settings disable mirroring see helps 
thanks info   normal nt matter  means runs fine  tried fast setting well 
sorry hear  seems 043 sdk introduced performance issues  ll see 044 comes  hopefully ll get better 
one new oculus sdk 043 comes 
yes   work   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v9yigar0jdt0  plan full game gameplay character might get well  m sure interaction things  sensible one desk scene m sure want people throwing things around breaking   ll see  kind leap support  least able see hands interact  chair  
yay  plan release linux version  want test first make sure least starts nt make black pink screen something  happened ago older builds  chair  
s strange  people weaker gpu s ran fine  try different quality settings  turning mirroring also help  make sure nvidia control panel nt forcing settings 
yay  thank much 
awwr  thank youuu   
thank much 
interesting  wonder alters perception demo  mention  people called  lsd simulator  times  
wow  thank much  s honoring hear made impression  ll certainly bring  3
yaaay  thank much showing others  yeah  improvements nt change experience significantly  rather add  polish  details 
hmm  peculiar  ll wait new oculus sdk see helps 
oh cool  m glad liked sorry arthritis  idea affects neck well   thank 
thanks  s always nice hear inspires motivates people  beyond wanted achieve demo  hope adventure beginning though   
yay  ll tweaking binaural audio next version    thanks info  m quite sure causes  think s new oculus sdk  ll definitely keep improving seeing make run smoothly  thank oo
thanks info  ll wait new sdk see helps performance  adding subtitles speech instead  s pretty important experience introduces concept looking around change scenery 
ll install linux distro soon test soon  last time tried  04x sdk s  issues 
thank  
m sorry issues  nt think s side  seems caused new oculus sdk  ll wait fix 
uploaded oculus share  takes approve  guess s lot people downloading right 
probably  sorry  takes lot work create arrange transitions scenes semiinterdependent  would cost tons time either create kind generic transition scene implement possible permutations  hand  would rather make ui  rather configuration file  nt user friendly break experience  
yaay  ve bunch troubles well  3dception guys really helpful helped resolve  hmm  s strange beginning gets judder  happen video playing  quality setting using  scenes work smoothly  thanks info 
woo  thank  s nice hear precisely goals demo  show possibilities vr create worlds familiar  also showcase concepts possibilities vr obvious play mind  thanks showing others 
yeah  congratulations  dude  well earned  totally mesmerising experience 
maybe make demo based exwife 
 seems happening   video playback monitor    rest butter smooth far  problem earlier versions sightline  4690k 44r9 290 try new version tomorrow 
getting intense judder scenes  apparently still getting 75fps 
know s problem  really aim flat 7576 make difference  
tried standard  good  setting  one  results  previous version sightline nt issue 043 runtime  even higher quality settings 
sorry hear issues  hw 
s definitely hw issue  seems software issue  probably sdk since people reporting fine 042 sdk  got weaker cpu  i5 2500  actually 
cpu gtx 980  mobo  asus p8z77v precise  cpu actually task anymore  never thought time upgrade already  
i72700k  gtx 970  win 81  judder cases  jumping right space scene seems fine first quickly gets really bad move head around  tried quality settings  vsync onoff  mirroring onoff  direct rift  rift external  primary   sadly  always result 
 judder  lags fps 
yes  one 
ll try later  last time tried back september 
yeah  happens titans space direct mode well since update  hope fixed next sdk
kidding  sightline benchmark application  
might issue system  tried empty scene single point light cube unreal 4 editor similar performance issues whenever looked cube  sli sli  fiddled nvidia 3d setting virtual reality prerendered frames  setting 1 4 nt seem make difference either  better wait new sdk guess 
help test  need guinea pig 
worries  thanks buddy  
great update  performs lot better  still odd judder volumes grass appear  video plays beginning  longer consistent  s 75fps every second ll jump   mostly feels smoother machine  great improvement 
ah  must one infamous sdk 043 problems  dramatic changes unity sdk   sorry issues  seems ll wait 044 
amd athlon 2 x4 620  quadcore 26 ghz  nvidia gtx 660 ti graphiccard win7 64bit  4gb ram  pc really isn´t fastest  issue may side  edit  guess  one downvoting  isn´t reading  wrote  issue may side  also people much faster pc issue  frooxius last version run fine  another cause judder 
asus p8z77v deluxe  overclocked 4793 test bring windows task manager  performance tab   resource monitor button  cpu tab  fourth core hitting around 90   m refusing upgrade broadwell released  side note  time rifters runs flawlessly
try  fastest  well  help determine issue stemming somewhere sdk  although think probably 
yes  s  nt fiddled way 
thanks info  ll update next sdk comes see 
s heavy hw  
well ue4 expensive hell even simple scene  got tons stuff default  ssrr  ssao  hdr  bloom  lens reflections  motion blur etc  
thought cat  yes  could use linux testing  variety 
thank info  m glad runs better  new sdk seems worsened people  nt done particular performance optimizations build though  must oculus  side 
issue dark desk scene framerate related  looking video monitor  affects everything around  nt really seen type skipping 043 demos utilize video  980 5820k  also  appear stuck scene grass turns buildings birds flying  sat 10 minutes looking around everywhere scene changes around 
yeah s cpu 
worries 
haha   well  scene full foliage good test  meant experience  s pushing boundaries great success  ps possible get book space scene  wanted cameo diorama m making
alrighty  one note  currently sdk works nvidia cards  messed call  s tracked think wo nt fixed next sdk release   s handful persystem issues  ve got working well enough sdk demos tf2  although tf2 think still old sdk version 
ah  s  sdk  must say vignette pretty bad  nothing  
strange  issue previous version  15  used 042 sdk  getting stuck strange  still nt found happens sometimes  s one worst bugs fix way     run several times debugger attached never happens   nt ran since bug  could send outputlog file data folder 
 worries anyway 
yeah  heard current sdk bunch issues  ll try update 044 soon release 
ll try add option switch  nt like much either 
nt many issues getting stuck desk scene judder previous version  used 043 runtime 15 version added forced3d11 direct mode shortcut get working  latency newer version seems lot lower though 
ve stuck 4 times  ve demoed 100 times   may need debug  several times  indeed 
hah  ve found 431 vignette quite subtle  many people complaining  realized  bet annoying wider ipd  narrower ipd maybe ca nt see much someone  say  70mm  anyway ll definitely check tonight 
reading last comment realize came sort jerk want clarify  absolutely love demo  minute minute fun anything else vr  loathe vignette  takes mostly able ignore fov  aware every single second experience   thought resolution really held experience back  resolution fov anything new sdk 
please let us know update version vignette  massive immersion breaker  stopped playing elite since updated  demo time favorite stick old version 
hmm strange  15 version used 042 sdk could difference  s strange need forced3d11  since demo already uses dx11 default 
yes  ran debugger lot  several times   point never happens debugging  demoing people  makes difficult trace replicate 
nt like much either  slightly narrower ipd average  think depends close oculus face  pretty close  could see edges look 
 bet annoying wider ipd  narrower ipd maybe ca nt see much someone  say  70mm  nail  meet head  ipd 70mm dot  043 vignette abhorrent  demand disabled rift media use  otherwise massive impact field view  probably chops good 15 degrees vertically 10 degrees horizontally  disgusting  needs toggleable every rift application 
oh nt silly  nt come jerk   although honest  worry lot time  nt like vignette  m sure turned oculus  plans  like could part profile   planning looking enabled disabled providing option  assuming oculus nt 
042 version demo add forced3d11 get direct mode working else would crash immediately  new version works fine without  issues mentioned 
also got stuck scene ran fast demo  ve always judder desk scene first version one s nothing new 
understand  wanted report possibly helpful statistics bug   seems people take complaining  though  instead noticing much ve demoing 
yes  bloody ruins everything nt know people nt complaining  elite literally went immersive annoying  hope actually getting fixed  though  unless oculus decides default   suspect drops rendered fov  thereby raising performance  doubt ll ever happen 
similar experience average ipd 
already many demos disabled  give option disable  s part sdk  runtime like many people think 
s still quite strange  used dx11 default since first version 
sorry issue  outputlog file getting stuck 
 nt know people nt complaining m guessing people nt wide enough ipd relevant  since mean ipd around 64mm
oh cool  nt poked around new sdk much yet  nt know  thanks info  d cool setting profile though  d uniform experiences 
mine 65 though  s extremely noticeable  distracting   granted seem notice technical issues whole lot  enormous oversight view 
binaural audio standard oculus rift games  convinced next big step immersion virtual reality 
lot discussion optimizing visual experience  acoustic immersion  listening  virtual barber shop   http  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v8ixm6suuigi  clip believe oculus rift games need binaural audio  way around  already efforts direction  oculus vr game developers aware binaural audio  hope nt waste opportunity make binaural audio standard oculus rift games

definitely agree  ve discussions friend back audio something re fully behind yet  nt really see value  basically  ears give us whole bunch cues help us place world re  s believable  sort takes us  eyes  ideally  would portion gpu alotted computing sound rays   sort like really coarse ray tracer since ears nt focus like eyes   sound events would cast rays reach player s ears  could get things like distancebased delay attenuation  attenuation translucent materials  materialbased reactions   hard reflections  like concrete    seems like sort thing belongs gpu since level data already  d need material data walls  nt seem like huge problem  additional parameter   think sort sound would mindblowing  particularly vr
sound cards almost rendered useless days people using onboard audio save money better video card  think creative looking developing binaural audio nothing else become relevant   came sound card specifically designed work head tracking binaural people would buy like hotcakes additional immersion piece vr  said think next logical step vr immersion think long run get probably version 10 vr  rome nt built day think need happy released first happy much better vr experiences come coming years   improvements areas immersion vr

developers embarrassed include 
binaural audio insane youtube audio vr must 
best 3d  sound scene ever heard  http  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v8ixm6suuigi  idea whats proper name
 noise cancelling headphones bass shakers chair win   
heard nt really understand special  sounds like normal surround sound  games nowadays already audio based characters position relation audio 
good affordable highfidelity headphones important immersion   gaming  brand headphones atrocious  something like audio technica ad700 bare minimum terms openness  soundstage  detail immersive gaming  near future might also new ultraaffordable planar magnetic headphones push standards lowcost hifi performance 
difference recording one sound knowing exactly listener placed vs generating sound head orientation player position  yeah  keep dreaming 
nt really much care since m using 51 sound system  canton 51 chrono  seems work surprisingly well  start game head towards center   turn head around room sound usually wanders speakers direction m supposed hear  limit headphones 
 free space pro many consider one best market  best binaural micophones super expensive full dummy heads like neumann ku100  free space pro best pricequality ratio  form factor great camera mounted use  would want seen street carrying mannequin head   
nt get asmr  fact video linked kinda grossed  quite opposite relaxing 
 check video one popular artists  http  youtubeq5lhjfxloa8  2  clicked 100  expecting heather feather  however  ll 
also  guy 3dio also makes binaural mic setup omnidirectional   ie  multiple sets ears mounted different angles fade rotate perspective imaginary head   http  3diosoundcomindexphp  mainpageproductinfo  cpath33  productsid46 think step towards using real binaural recordings interactively things like video games 
mics look really cool  ca nt help wonder 4channel omni directional mic 4 times 2channel binaural mic  o0
 deleted 
use dolby headphone  positional sound pretty great  sound quality hit makes bother use 
 problem hrtf realtime algorithms come close quality real binaural recordings  nt even work headtracking  yet  things moving along quickly  ve harping  must keep faith 
 different normal audio  start 3d stereo  pretty straight forward
even got patched lot games licensing bullshit surrounding creative  d love see general technology back

 eyes  ideally  would portion gpu alotted computing sound rays     exactly amd trueaudio  s dedicated bit gpu sound plugins use calculations  ray tracing  hrtf  etc   
thatt sound cards work  simply convert digital analog  dsp comes cpu 
sadly see companies pulling stunts like saying built binural audio head tracking  complete sham make difference quality  sound cards simply handle transition digital analog  amplification  s important audio source headphones  people  mean people spend less  50 headphones  onboard audio sufficient  want good audio setup reccomendation would spend money set headphones wide soundstage  really need good midrange iem decent soundstage around  50  would probably good enough people  end spending thousands audio gear search perfection 
way notice jauntvr ambisonic microphone mounted rig  good use tech 
amd working  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v6uutflmqq
exactly  nt see people nt understand yet 
proper name know holophonic sound  ll find lot demos online search  http  enwikipediaorgwikiholophonics
probably third party surround post processing enabled  creative stuff gaming headphones  etc  need basic stereo headphones stereo mode barber video work right 
listened video cheap ear buds still incredibly immersive  point binaural  recorded headphones relay experience  sure expensive ones would better quality  real work done recording generation audio 
amd trueaudio 
objects nt make stereo audio  rather  ear receives sound slightly different time  shape ears also help determine certain positions  need sort audio ray tracer uses two renderers  one ear   amd trueaudio sort thing re looking 
 limit headphones  unless array speakers equally distributed offplane    nt going able reproduce audio sources correctly tilt head  even speakers abovebelow  d issue environment influencing sound due real world reflections occlusions  headphones allow designers remove pretty well environmental factors send audio directly ears  way hmd eyes  
yeah  nt relaxing  listening sounds saliva plosives mic already like nails chalkboard makes effect 10000x worse

heather definitely popular reddit maria always og badass  still blows mind something underground years ago  one first nonhd binaural videos nearly 45 million views 
nt source  ve heard creative essentially killed hrtf  bought company making ton breakthroughs  got ton patents  stopped anything 
software audio systems use two speakers volume get spacial effects  work fine normal speaker setups  s extremely irritating using headphones  spinning next audio source change volume 0  100   alternating speaker   ears work much differently  gauge distance based amount lag sound hits one ear  shape ears enhances effect well  effect nt exactly work headphones  need binaural audio  like 3d head tracking allows eyes gauge distance depth well  binaural audio allows us hear effects happening around us without extremely irritating inaccurate changes volume  use razer surround personally  since s free time   works fairly well converting multichannel 71 surround binaural stereo audio  least sounds much much better razer megalodon headphones  surround sound super  tinny  usb headset  buy stereo headset install razer surround software

oh s far better quality  raw details   headphones great balance detail  eg  popular one somewhat affordable sennheiser hd600  number others  deliver much realistic timbre lesser headphones  meaning voices  environmental noises  metallic sounds  explosions  etc etc  anything recorded real life used ingame sound lifelike  analogy would going say averagejoe 1080p tn led panel hypothetical panel retina display level pixel density  plus true black black eyeblinding white  quality  actually trick mind make things convincingly real  real issue though actual realisticsounding headphones hard find even headphone audiophile selection cans  simple metrics gauge one headphone better another absolute level   1500 headphone might actually less realistic sound presentation another  600 one  instance  s black white price  performance curve unlike techs like screens computing 
obviously people wrong home theaters years  51  71  91 beyond  even cinemas  ve handed people headphones played back binaural sound  besides  tilt head virtual world sound source nt change place hear sound different tilted head real world sound source nt move  every hmd exactly guarantees best possible experience  people waited vr years probably know  call back properly emulate 57 sound sources rich bass via headphones maybe ll convert   p

headphone hobby catching thanks infamously poor sounding stylistic beats dre    rather decent headphone audiophile setup  naturally  people become headphone users  binaural audio catch well  asmr  offshoot  developed fans  m glad s catching  really important immersion s sake

quality sound immersion less binaural sound  proper spatial effect sounds simply adds realism virtual reality way better sound quality ca nt  would like options either stereoscopic vision high resolution screen  obviously desired  immersion virtual world  resolution far less important stereoscopic vision

tried writing longer response different ways different examples  s probably worth convince small minority  agree multichannel speaker systems provide much pronounced positional audio within limited scope  end requiring hrtf adjustment sources plane  fail altogether positions  hope sake game developers invest necessary time adjusting sound setup speaker crowd  cause otherwise s going pretty broken experience  pretty much every game ever made sound reception pinned camera orientation  camera orientation controlled heads  headphones ready made fit  virtual ears receive sound exactly spots headphones play back  speaker users hand going require special sound setting order decouple virtual ears camera affix shoulders  maybe fudge sort hrtf compensation simulate vertical information  games demos available currently rift  many speaker option toggle 
 pretty much every game ever made sound reception pinned camera orientation  camera orientation controlled heads  headphones ready made fit  virtual ears receive sound exactly spots headphones play back  never really thought  right  moving head left right sound kind wanders speakers  tilt guess nt place go  sense adopting binaural audio would even worse thought  since use limited headphones 
game nt vr speaker setting  move head direction re going getting wrong positional audio speakers  virtual audio source front game  ll hear front speakers get correct positional audio  turn head left  right ear facing towards sound game   audio speakers end played right speakers directly behind head  every degree turn head one way  audio move opposite direction equal amount  s bad   headphones get correct positional audio matter head  would really want situation audio move remain fixed front speakers regardless head  even games incorporate options  solve positional issue audio sources coming plane speakers  sound coming 45deg speaker sitting  speakers need additional processing fake vertical element  incorporate  binaural  hrtf processing based whether sound bouncing forehead re looking  bouncing face re looking directly  hrtf changes sound much simpler implement pair headphones due much fewer variables mix  would nt get hopes polished speaker experience vr

nonrift owner  yet  d love see footage 
sounds like nice project  export linux executable  thanks 
okey tried  cool demo  like sense scale ll get soon stare upon great wall  make open doors interact stuff xbox controller  walk control stick  add stuff  details  cool experience  especially got fans  edit  also  would cool look see ground beneath disappear go higher higher
nt work pc reason  get black screen fades  nothing 
nice  sense scale wall pretty cool  please tell m something wrong way go lift  
two big ears looks interesting  wonder made also work video streaming 51 surround binaural  sound could rotated head tracking  could great software audio solution vrplayer 
tried  recommend reducing loading screen time 5 seconds  sat dark 30 seconds slowly faded  sound good  snowflakes nice touch  hoping see beyond wall top instead greeted trench  think bit landscaping side reduced fog effect would nice 
thanks putting effort make  cool experience  movement speed nice slow footsteps  especially sound walking snow  added immersion nicely  thought elevator contrasted wall much looked place could settings  keep good work

nt find riding elevator especially exciting  slow  afterwards climb wall look  closing vertigo xd love sense height  works well m prone vertigo real life certain situations  haha  s panic inducing yet though  probably wind simulators  fans   etc bla bla  like hbo version  falling bit odd right  yes jumped  actually hesitation  bit unsure could actually fall  trying meant ride elevator get explore  eventually tried  exciting  clip wall way though  p got bit weird  heh  enjoyed much  like could walk around castle black rode elevator  sure looks small   haha  oh deceptions  mind explodes thinking vr adventure games based popular ips  feels like compelling product  stark contrast feel screen games based movies today oo weird works  still needs quality content though  m guessing first things come  quicker product  vistas  dioramas  experiences limited interactivity like  full games takes time make probably appear much later  thank glimpse future 3
go learning unity 
cool  planning adding experience  think lot said experience demos full games  plan make sources available  really awesome btw 
oh thanks much  ve trying different software without success  thanks 
lol started opening door elevator going 
nt created video yet  ll try get one soon

video sample setup  would nice know details fov  resolution framerate
issues  m sure footage great watching 3d tvs  rift  s really going work well    dummy head  technology capture video stunning 3d hd  eyes see  binaural microphones place silicon ears equidistant human ears create 3d stereo sensation  steadicam stabilization system create fluid motion mimic human head s calibrations smooth vision  rift  viewers need able turn heads look around scene re watching  generally requires use either camera array least two cameras 180 degree fisheye lenses  vr playback software like  vr player   http  vrplayercodeplexcom  able display type footage rift  although s best correctlyconfigured custom player works outofthebox  could based vr player   turn head  audio sources must remain fixed space  move  requires use microphone arrays sophisticated enough uniquely locate audio sources space  simple binaural mics ca nt really without complex postprocessing   special software playback hrtfs  vr player nt  players like total cinema 360 s   steadicam problematic rift footage induces moderate amounts acceleration long periods time  s fine moving fixed speed along line  turning slowly  sweeping cinematic curved movements induce vr sickness 
m wondering ll see first stereoscopic 360 camera system lets look      always lose immersion look see weird black circle  logo  camera harness apparatus body  system yet   nt seen  seems like ideally d customizable  self  avatar could augment cameraperson  perhaps camera operator wears fullbody greenscreen suit masked later replaced digital avatar  tiniest bit nose lowermiddle frame would help lot 
unless re planning everything put 2 weeks labor  re asking nearly enough money  think ask 10x put serious production  fundraising additional episode 
amazing  good luck project 
sounds awesome  really curious cameramic setup  though  many degrees camera  many mics  sound change head turns 
guys shooting video headtracking mind  180 fisheye headtracking 3d  wide angle lenses fixed perspective 
man  really hope hits goal  awesome vr concept needs exist 
good luck game  d love help  nt credit card donate  looking forward release though 
pitch video  project aims release film  strange see evidence video production  please nt take hate  seems like lack commitment campaign  best luck hope get valuable feedback  wo nt backing  nt give though  s good idea worth refining  may effective way get valuable feedback 
backed  really nice selection  targets    
sorry say  nt sample footage  kickstarter provide necessary funding build rig  ll uploading examples content show soon possible  details  ll using 2 gopros  steroscopic mount  1080p superview  extreme wide fov  create 180 degree 3d hd videos  24 fps  option slowmo   use vrplayer watch show  format  side side  projected dome setting

ricoh theta budget 360 degree camera takes pictures everything around  also loose centimetres due stitching together two 180 images s acceptable  s hd nt record movies 
would killer  ll always looking upgrade show move forward full seasons pilot 
kickstarter pilot episode  money create custom rig travel expenses camp throughout 4 parks highlighted  goal create popular youtube channel use pitch material get funding full season  travel world  give viewers best global experience 
thank  help us spread word  would love viewer someday 
ideally would omnidirectional binaural mic  quite expensive  order realistic kickstarter  goal  opted use standard binaural mic  sound would fixed  please help us exceed goal buy omnidirectional bring best content tech  camera provide 180 degrees 3d immersion allow small head movements within fov 
180 fisheye 3d using vrplayer  similar program   formatted side side dome projection
agree  thank  please help us spread word  want share awesome experiences rift users  
thanks 
hey  thanks note  main reason pitch video equipment create 3d content  hence ze campaign funding   thought would odd upload traditional 2d vidaudio pitch 3d project  plan upload video later campaign update keep interest going strong throughout 30 days  going purchase binaural mic money midway upload video least demonstrate 3d audio immersion  thoughts  get 2d pitch vid  seem know kickstarter well
thank much  please continue spread word  really want bring beauty parks rift 
hmm interesting  24fps cause weirdness viewed thru vr headset  d think would introduce pretty severe motion blur 
superview mode standard gopro lenses immersive vr player  170 degrees  diagonal  view  125 degrees horizontal  90 degrees vertical  gives maximum 175 degrees lookaround experience left right see leftright borders images  vertical borders well view  might well use tracking  use rift regular 3d viewer youtube content 
extent inspiredinformed experience japan demo  nt rift basis reaction videos seems like whatever technique used managed get result re hoping 
see  hope answered questions  feel free message  would love support 
exact mic looking towards  kickstarter budgeted regular 3dio  ideally  would use mic  spread word hopefully exceed goal buy 
 s stereoscopic  d lose sense depth 
re welcome  majority funding ll raise generally first three days last three days  campaigns acquire 10  first day two generally good chance successful  keeping momentum start problem  take makevr example  sixense launched campaign prices backers said high  sixense responded feedback fairly quickly  became apparent late make real impact public perception time   wisely  cancelled  yei held ks priovr tracking system quite ago went pretty poorly  yet learned mistakes latest attempt wildly successful  even ks nt go well  proof second chances provided research  study kickstarters done well  careful kind rewards promise  international shipping nightmare  blowing money kickstarter makes expert yeah   p valuable thing offer  look ks pitch honesty  even project described concept imagery  see creator s passion vision  see eagerness overcome obstacle dream generally always back interested project  forced  clear goals  straight forward regards challenges share passion  every bit effort put selling idea convinces us care  lots people oculus forums d willing help technical advice  filming  well reach potential backers  research research research  hope helps 
imagine huge problem  d recommend testing 720p 60fps  lower resolution fov least 60fps base test vr  testing oculus  right 
exactly  regular 3d viewer available  however  wo nt using standard gopro lenses achieve 180 degrees  nt want give away recipe secret sauce  nt tested lens setup obviously  need funding equipment  extreme fisheyes distort much  may resort regular 3d viewer  thanks advice 
actually inspired 3d binaural walkthrough  machu picchu   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vs0ugsaksbay  check  s experience japan demo  link  would love learn technique  thanks 
m fully aware  even 2d 2ddepth could interesting enough  far know cheapest simple use camera takes 360 degree photos nt cost 1000 usd 
yes  ll testing rift find optimal fps  thanks suggestion 
well  one secret sauce use sunex 219 m12 fisheye lenses  like one stereo rigs  gopros gives 185 degree wide  150 degree high fisheye view  bunch full circle m12 c mount  adapter  fisheye lenses use gopros  less hacking  couple recent vr player movies rig  maybe help judging whether distortion much http  wwwredditcomroculuscomments2147kmmoreriftvirtualrealitycinematographyin http  wwwredditcomroculuscomments217okqgooglestrekkerportablestreetviewrigin

new sightline  chair  gets 3dception  binaural audio  developer discusses vr audio  road virtual reality
""
audiophile  ve always felt audio afterthought titles  glad see starting get love deserves 
m giddy like school girl  need something good use new sennheisers 
maybe finally games monsters behind thick walls ceilings wo nt heard right next 
seehear big difference 3dception visisonics software  used right 
know going sound little ungrateful  anyway  eta 044 build sightline  go demo showing dk 2 currently pick version awesome binaural audio far less awesome vignette  043  version neither  042 
yes  s amazing realistic audio feel whole experience sound generally important  s sometimes gives feel visual information  like shooting gun game rock falling  would nt nowhere impressive without sound   wo nt happy get least really good wavetracing  something functionally equivalent  games  simulating sound keeps bouncing complex environment  diffuse materials 
check affected  cabin  looks incredible 
think claims binaural beats hemisync   read years ago heard wonder claims improved brain function brainwave state manipulation inflated 
yaaay another sennheiser user  3 sennheiser hd595 
new sennheisers  im gon na guess hd598 
yes  frustrates games  keep hearing something keep looking around idea sound coming  although something bit different binaural audio like  although wavetracing create effects naturally  games already  separating level rooms example filtering sound re different regions 
tried  different demos settings s difficult compare  3dception recommends use classic unity reverberation combination solution  felt realspace uses something  s wild guess  s big difference unity implementation though  realspace really bad api nonsensical design  room definition tied specific sound source  sound source defines room  adds 400 mb hrtf definitions project 
prefer realspace3d  would love redownload update projects m working site    http  realspace3daudioapps1and1comdevelopers  plugindownload  two weeks  096 version sight  still 4 audio source sound limit  oculus mentioned going release realspace demo couple months connect nothing far either 
imagine would like  virtual barber shop   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  viudtlvagjja  head tracking  s already immersive moment  mixed head tracking visuals would astounding 
""
something ve ever heard  ll take look though 
hd 600 user  ugh  re absolutely fantastic  step m50s
yup  ca nt beat  110 
yeah  s probably realistic gets  use rig microphones actual models ears  capture sound ears would  edit  picture  http  3diosoundcomimageshomepageslide1jpg
love game papa sangre  ios  s basically stimulated binaural audio game video  traverse environment using sound  s pretty fun 
omg   awesome  links things like 
thanks posting barber shop link  great  never even knew possible  question though  hear anything front  hear left  right  behind  never forward  ive tried bunch binaural 3d  including sightline  realspace  various youtube vids  stuff front  perceive behind  happens sightline btw

thanks  include instructions minecrift readme  m sure anyone reads   edit  hmmm  ca nt find instructions anymore  include  possibly look enabling hrtf without config file 
 openal games   http  enwikipediaorgwikiopenal  games   tried bioshock  nt seem work 
sounds like yet another reason minecrift first vr experience get ahold dk2 cv1 
thank much  3
s awesome  audio heavily delayed video though  
s  finally get try oculus rift first thing m gon na play minecrift binaural audio  sorry half life 2 
man s great news  really quite hassle 
impression real time binaural audio processing really system intensive  thus explaining barely games  anyone explain  cluver talking audio delayed  related 
since s creating file  button installer  
 deleted 
ca nt really say much state windows  practically anything linux uses  make sure using 44100hz 
games pretty dead though  game d really want cs  go
re gon na absolute blast man  mc dk1 stunning enough first  continues immersive fantastic   ca nt imagine high def low persistence  drool 
nt played minecraft long time  s going right  massive caverns  deep ravines  giant buildings  absolutely incredible 
last time tried minecrift  months ago  admittedly  higher latency games detrimental experience 
thoughts exactly  ve waited long purchasing dk1  minecrift trying  dk2 release next week confirmed  right 
run linux get hl2 binaural audio 
really  s intensive adding proper environment raytracing  makes environment reflect sound effects  without canning  head related transfer function done entirely software 
sure   ll add list 
s pretty epic  even clunky dk1 
0  back square one haha 
 wavetracing   
enabling without config file  ca nt yet  openalsoft author mentioned possibility making plugin  moment s accessible via configuration file 
m sure could done enough creativity  probably worth effort config file effective restart 
well  went route  wait oals dev release plugin xd
added small guide enable binaural audio tf2 tf2 wiki oculus user guide   linux 
""
guess tf2 uses directx sound api windows  bleh  wonder would way get support binaural audio windows version somehow  tried setting openal binaural audio minecraft  windows  nt work reason  
awesome  factoid openal  114 supports headrelated transfer functions  know  already tried vrui s spatial sound  regular stereo works really well hmds  version openal old try right away  experimental theater piece involving three collaboration sites one oculus rift two kinects  default audio spatialization already big hit performers  edit  inserted missing  old 
work os x also right  os x supports openal 
checklist  make sure s 441khz  make sure file right spot  work minecrafts built openal 
s really funny  linux  using wine  windows programs end using openal anyway  get binaural sound like  borderlands 
 however tell tf2  minecraft  even games running wine fully work sound spatialization  since wine s directsound implementation mostly points openal  m quite sad unnoticed feature  s year longer  ve promoting every chance get  next version minecrift installer include enable openal hrtf  option  accept patch  ve got hrtf tables available  plug openal 
tf2   yep  find needs openal configuration file 
know guide could link  nt play mc much anymore lronly sound pissed  edit  nevermind  scrolled saw comment explaining  thanks 
another awesome point linux  programs use  audio workstation  available linux d switch heartbeat  way  got working  turns minecraft downloads openal 32 64 bit dlls replace 
moments  run vruisoundtest  posiiton soundemitting sphere anywhere 3d using regular navigation  hrtf enabled  audio match 
minecraft binaural would amazing  monsters sounding like re inches ear re actually outside castle gets old 
ll try couple games 
wooo  needs windows   
 link nt want search   http  wwwredditcomroculuscomments258hdliaddedasmallguideonhowtoenablebinauralchev7uq 
anymore  recent minecraft launcher new enough openal work 
later today  actually think vrui still installed system 
easily  s one things uses openal windows  create file  appdata  called alsoftini  put hrtftrue  
weird  version using 179 maybe s placebo effect work haha 
argh  nt work box vrui 31 nt force 44100 mixer frequency  added options openal context attributes upcoming release  works  think default hrtf nt match ears well  get little spatialization  luckily  cipic audio lab  one pioneers binaural audio measurement equipment think  hallway office   
whoa  try get home  thanks 
s good  look openal s docs  describes put things custom hrtf table format load openal 
cv1 got way better cheaper  imagine 199   1440p cv1 proprietary binaural audio tech    result deal  would feel better 
title  palmer stated reddit replies statements deal enables considerably cut device s price add features nt think otherwise could  nt doubt  2 billion nt pocket change  could palpable improvements repair broken trust 
thing  hate happened  think lot concerns least slightly exaggerated   initial reaction  oculus dead     well  slept   ve seen people say facebook pop ads game sessions  find highly unlikely  know facebook obsessed advertising social platforms whatnot  doubt would something sort  predict facebookcentric social hub access want everything facebookrelated take place  vr facebook games  social networking  ads  etc   let s forget ultimately still hdmiusb device acts monitor  nt see facebook fuck game sending signal display  biggest concern heard  oh shit  developers drop support instantly  think bit overreaction  oculus still biggest vr project far  people still want vr really really bad  developers might   incentive adopt medium rift became financially stable platform  nt deny possibility everything could go shit time   hate happened  right think people exaggerating teeny tiny bit 
yes  would feel better  would make even better would oculus manages release actual massspread statement would atleast stop biggest kneejerkreactions  swear god felt like rgaming 
think close  250   200 would even better 
 would nt feel better  vr coming  s stopping  facebook fucking parasite company  nothing rift justify fucked privacy policies  data rights management  absolute inability give fuck end users  s shill  s blatant sellout

 250 vr motion controllers bundled  
nope  would feel much worse  said another thread  subsidized device bad thing  means make via advertisement andor fb store exclusive games  want use fully ll pay fb 
nope  option  400 sony free facebook  would buy sony 
yes
1440p already given  honest  nt think vr look  amazing  re 4k per eye  seriously doubt 2 billion injection get oculus  technology nt yet  may 45 years road  said  interested finding display tech allegedly spending  hundreds millions   4k  2k per eye  would nice surprise  nt think single company world mass produce one yet   guess ll getting 1440p oled tailor made vr  rgb could cards  already knew d getting 90hz similar refresh rate   m getting  probably end getting similar specs ones ones planned deliver originally  nasty drawbacks phone screens   like hopefully rgb instead pentile   course speculation  palmer claims ll news  soon  maybe ll know something 2015   soon  could really mean anything  though point might best interest give info sooner rather later damage control   come think  would old owners spend newly acquired 2 billion help company longer  company mercy much facebook willing invest future vr  sure ll would nt sell company someone else  invest money paid back sake new owners  sadly  wait see 
yes would also allow works keep spinning 
like general thought thread  think binaural fundamental proprietary solution  something open across vr platforms would much preferable  cheaper rift incredible tech  part sounds great  course 
d love able step  seated experience  palmer stated goal cv1  would huge leap 
""
2 billion money going company  money going pockets founders  funding company initiatives come facebook 
 felt part something like small investments part community pushing something much bigger  feel nothing  like ve lost grip something meaningful nothing anymore s biggest loss 
think cv1 already going 1440p screen  talking getting custom hardware  perhaps rounds 4k screens something  m keeping positive attitude things better could 
yes  nt force use facebook bs  d rather buy  450 device  200 device forced facebook  ads

remember xbox one   announced  hate xbox one  terrible  day one launch  hey everyone look xbox one  lot people talk 
oculus rift external monitor motion tracking  facebook acc  understood commented  carry 
think nt fully realize much 2bn exactly  could research build medium size factory  15bn left  good point spending money company nt 
4k oculus rift would amazing  god picturing 
cautionary levelminded thinking forbidden  got  edit  oh seems comment everything 
see xbone nt selling  re sleeping shelves store ps4 sold  bs microsoft saiddone pre launch hurt sale  steam really speed release something  yes hurt oculus rift 
also forgot though lot  features  xbox one reveal repealed microsoft  things like always requiring connection 
would apply oculus announced needlessly obstructing  inconvenient anticonsumer features rift  right  association names 
 think nt fully realize much 2bn exactly  could research build medium size factory  15bn left  plastic housing  maybe  nt think understand expensive semiconductor manufacturing  oculus cashed  2billion stock straight building lcd plant  d get halfway finished running capital  assuming r  free   grand total 10 lcd manufacturing complexes planet  largest corporations partner order build  nt forget another billion every years refit plant operate newer process technologies 
d spend 3 times headset get graphic cards render 4k smoothly  nt know even 3 780 ti render 4k good graphics 60 fps  ve found lot people talking 4k eye  nt seem think s still displays displays need lot computing power run games smoothly realistic graphics  probably nt good enough graphics card currently handle high resolutions realism high framerate vr would require  even 1440p good graphic card handle resolution would cost around  400  thinking gtx 770   m assuming people already graphics cards already  probably something suitable 4k  right graphics cards limiting factor  resolution 
difference xbox something bad  knew bad  knew bad  nt situation 
   one day  one day
 d spend 3 times headset get graphic cards render 4k smoothly nt render screen s native resolution  simply want 4k screen door image crisp sharp  simply scale image like video cards ca nt handle max settings video game  1080p signal 4k screen look far  far better 1080p signal 1080p screen 
wait see turn  oculus going way  yea still good  pull move like microsoft  hurt lot  see  minecraft development stopped oculus soon facebook bought  maybe dev thing

could binaural audio maybe alleviate motion sickness  brain kind point focus  maybe increasing illusion re actually turning

d love see  hear  marco polo game using realspace3d audio 
great video review always  d love try modified version tuscany   perhaps time revisited old iphone audio invaders game vr  th original 2d version space invaders could hear see  quite following amongst visually impaired players time  http  gamesaladcombloggamesaladgamereviewaudioinvaders  nt advertising getting  currently broken  old needs serious make   ios8 update works  dk2 distracting   
isnt longer called binaural audio simulated 
nt know  guess d say much  audio nt completely realistic latency  s going sound bit weird  whereas happens visuals  whole world see jumping around way s supposed much stronger impact  adds sense presence convinces brain sees really  might help somewhat 
download modified version 
currently way swap track demo uses without much hassle  base version   d love able throw favorite songs sure something needs tweaked get full effect positional audio 
nt know anything  d rather see wavetracing  beamtracing  raya calls  solution though unity 
nt see would case  s binaural audio synthesis  binaural recording  binaural means s eyes  similar oculus binocular device  giving us binocular cues depth  distance size objects see  compared monocular ones screen 
s available publicly  ll see get permission release song used  otherwise ll change 
download source version realspace request license key 
ah okay  justthought remember somone correcting called 
great  would really nice could use song folder  audible zone audiosources also got bigger 
fine  asked real space website project  although 3d sound likely expire users 180 days s free indie license key  may want put note readme  also note disable third party dts surround software nt seem work right first  unknowingly  edit  actual song sure 
well re wrong   binaural means  two ears  
m sure s possible currently  realspace 3d nt really like even swapped audio sources runtime  put songs mute one  scripting api kinda weird though pleasant work  ll poke around see somehow add 
 m talking licensing terms realspace  m aware   song ve used 
oh ok  
rift games binaural audio like 
put high quality headphones earphones go somewhere quiet dark  listen   interrogation chamber   http  myoutubecomwatch  vu163wc6mp2a  3d audio sounds real  nt tried rift yet would think binaural audio would take experience another level  able hear exactly things 3 dimensional space would make realistic  rift games maybe even movies use technology 
problem nt got proper solution yet  audio binaural demos kind work s needed sense space moving sounds  nt need real  everyone hears differently reason different shaped shoulders  head importantly ears  movies record audio system shaped like head  makes hard implement head tracking audio recorded one angle  quality would example posted  would bigger problems something see sounds might seem come  people might good  bad  akg made nice recordings way back past putting small microphones ear channels 50 different test subjects recording certain noise echofree room coming different directions  find net try listening samples  see recording made human sound different  much   two three sample sets sounded ok  others either nt sound 3d weird way  software tried solve making generic hrtf  head related transfer function  tuned  audio distorted different ways depending sound originated  m sure anyone got even close right  tried  example rapture3d audio engine games use  vr becomes huge hit next step see indeed solving binaural audio problem s second thing vision makes vr immersive  remember someone oculus saying s much harder problem solve hmds fully believe

nearly every game binaural audio configure audio options headphones  s convincing since algorithms imperfect  nt see ll better  since nothing recording turn head direction  come solely audio processing algorithms use nt see making breakthrough  basically expect  binaural audioscape  used marketing term something nearly every nonvr game already

thought interesting read related vr  oculus course
spoke someone team months ago said made demo oculus  360 video  binaural sound  radar  nt know s top priority  article nt overly optimistic binaural create huge advancements  kind agree  think could great record general ambience binaural give sense depth  maybe audio queues come behind  nt think s make break thing audio immersion  m mostly focused video rather gaming  argument kind similar whether video needs stereoscopic 
sadly bbc research team 1970 s 1980 s worked aspect much success  think one demos still available yt  sad fact however recent changes bbc investment saw team knowledge disbanded  watching bbc wake lost opportunity sickening 
audio post production gon na take different method previously used compile mix audio binaural recording becomes popular   fuckin finally  
actual binaural audio starts 600  case anyone nt want listen entire harlem shake 
given stage ca nt rely binaural audio engines included lot titles  headphones compare surround speakers properly set 
edit  clarity  mean used conjunction vr 
one major difference  headphones follow head turn  surround speakers fixed 
bad 3d audio sub surround system main attraction  feeling deep bass add alot
two ears  decent headphones different surround sound setups except better turn head  prefer open cans large soundstage produce 
headphones way go vr  directionality sources consistent head s turned  also helps immersion  surrounding  hearing  especially closed isolating headphones  get pair beyerdynamic dt770 pro headphones lose  d recommend seatmounted subvibration unit  basically vibrates seat according low frequencies  alternatively sub next 
s exactly point  without binaural audio engines headphones going rip away immersion surround systems wo nt  edit  clarity mean   binaural audio engines head tracking implementations
heard new elite game actual hmdspeaker mode  
think  bass shaker   http  wwwthebuttkickercomgamer2  good headphones going best audio option vr games quite time  openal good 3d implemented afaik high hopes major vr engines something working time cv1 product 
yeah  s thinking  ve tuned 51 set pretty well  well  anyway  sounds mostly seamless completely  games perform really well  m hoping m inside vr headset might assist distract making surround feel seamless 
 deleted 
would nt opposite  turn head 180 degrees  simplicity s sake   sound   right projected right speaker    would left side head  sort applicationaddon accounted  sure surround would probably pretty awesome  nt heard anything 
seems might thinking wrong way  second thought  engine aware surround sound applies player position  re turning head surround sound speaker environment  sound appear warp headphones wo nt  right  early crap right  lol 
initially thought much   turning head audio following unless audio engines implemented head tracking mind  sounds like deal  immersion  breaker    edit  guess lot engines already follow player position though  nt  might bad 
moment real need sound card cleaner sound output would spend  80 sound card best put money towards better headset  back days eax 50 around good 3d sound games lucky souund like eax 30
yep  commented realised   modern engines apply directional sound player screw surround sound applied head tracking  bummer  headphones   p

maybe work pure software solution  nothing superior  binaurally recorded  sound  provided good algorithm cross fading  may realistic hrtf method  one major drawback lack vertical information  looks like pure software solution needed movement along zaxis

something really cool hrtfs  group friends talk time  focus individual voice listen himher  record conversation using one mic  wo nt able  ll sound like gibberish  record individual speeches  place virtual world  apply hrtf  ll able focus individuals  edit  ca nt find exact place ve read     http  enwikipediaorgwikisoundlocalization  soundlocalizationbythehumanauditorysystem  s start  edit 2  think also helps facebook s push social use rift  ll able participate group chats ease 
okay  m interested rs3da  thanks writeup paul 
wow  speaker villa  amazing  others said fall insanely exaggerated seriously  really fooling brain 
case site nt loading anyone else  link demos  http  realspace3daudiocomdemos
ear buds seem work much better headphones  tried bose headphones first completely underwhelmed  put old ipod ear buds holy cow  way better 
another right piece puzzle presence  huge speaker tuscany demo amazing  like close eyes spin move randomly using xbox controller  turn head towards source sound open eyes  speaker always right place   
awesome  make sure turn third party surround enhancements trying tuscany demo  speaker inside house crazy 
ok  sick  tuscany stairs thought turning volume wake anybody house  since trying demo middle night  realized using headphones  damn awesomely crazy 
difference something like openal 
wonder means us prefer sitting strategically middle 51 surround system wearing headphones 
 webpage available   
wonder interact dedicated 3d audio processing high end amd cards  stuff demoed last fall  possibility amd leg result

think s quite good  using koss headphones  turn back sound source  sounds wrong volume way low  also nt like  trigger  sound walking close  put sound sources apart make audible  almost  anywhere  make sure check flying seagulls  well  wished could hear waves bit better 
kind underwhelmed unimpressed  maybe using beats headphones  try get another pair try perhaps 
good question  relevant aureal patents expired 2012 
nt stand chance might teh facebook lawyers 
really revelation  dial back superlatives article impressed 
think s something people nt appreciate importantvital experience  try 
 adding couple sound emitting items tuscany demo feels like completely new experience  got presence right away standing front fountain music box upstairs  edit  seriously grab pair headphones  turn volume go walk around demo  finally demo shows important 3d sound presence 
 re sadpandajpg
definitely better  expecting realism windows  walk around perimeter house  music nt play windows fades away way fast  least rig went today 
poor holly  ever    
almost got moment presence sitting next fireplace listening music  great

want know well  d really love add type audio vr audiobook player  tried make atmospheric existing  positional  sound possible  s obviously hrtf based sound engine 
accommodating engines oculus  especially ue4   beneficial cultivation vr medium  say oculus definitely open 
well ue4 opensource s like really matters
got lucky made download  reuploaded mediafire  s link  https  wwwmediafirecom  cae8ucbbxqk971c must admit  works right  audio engine amazing  unfortunately serious inconsistencies  missing features  instance  sound seems jump  cutting way soon  speaker main building best example  walk door  s blaring loud  move feet away entrance  suddenly s gone  s sound works  sound playing re moving around room  makes huge difference immersion  definitely favorite version tuscany demo date 
3 hours left download   3
always put sound last  never bought sound card  never really saw reason  games even take advantage good sound cardsspeakersetc  
think sharp dropoff intentional demo avoid sounds interfering

d agree  fountain ok  though impressive front back  fire pretty good turn 90°  ear nt facing still hear clearly way sounds fake  speaker definitely best actually sounds convincing coming front  similar tech fails  re instantly let butterfly  wow  hell going  approach  sounds like s coming overhead behind  sounds cutting suddenly  reckon s counter bound affected game environment  sounds inside house muffled re outside vice versa   doubt constraint simple nature demo  way fire s dynamic light visible outside house  ve something ground breaking audiowise long time  s necessity immersion  ve high hopes concentrated r  effort oculus produce something great 
think mostly execution  fair number hrtf  derivative  providers claim special thing  s rapture3d  cmss  razer surround  astoundsound many  aim provide one thing  accurate positioning sound  visisounds usp personalised hrtf  claim ale derive photographs  maybe able send photos ears get back hrtf  imo real breakthrough vr sound comes proper waveray    traced sound occlusion  reflections  diffusion  etc  hrtfs surely add  wo nt end solution 
  would possibly even cooler  tried demo conference like  multiplayer voice 3d positional sound  nt hrtf amazingness  still  extremely impressive   using quake 3 think 
yes  think  good pair headphones important  real wizardry filtering audio sources real time match brain s expectations  example  sound directly behind somewhat muffled   low pass filtered  want real term  shape ears  also  sounds hit ear slightly different time  brain picks unbelievably small differences uses triangulate position sound  kind positionalbinaural audio works headphones  simulating cues  many others  s complex task  essentially create audio equivalent 3d image 
 company   also   announced ’ licensing 3d spatial audio processing technology called realspace 3d audio visisonics  hope clears  
according oculus 
got issue
 honestly took headphones times make sure sound nt blasting speakers  exact thing  went around entire house first nt impressed  soon stepped building  holy shit  mind blown  walking stairs  getting close   eerily convincing 
headphones great speaker still extremely convincing 
different api  idk man  one seem hrtf sound default  standard openal nt even  d need custom openal build third party developers  
m sure technical side  however effort keep home title captain obvious would like point one key difference  one standard used oculus rift 
means re probably want wear headphones  software accounting fact wearing headphones listening speakers effect simply wo nt sound correct 
3d sound like works headphones  simple answer experience 
51 sound systems headphones always like 3d tvs vr headsets  imitation real thing  never truly beat real deal matter much money spend 
 s best audio set oculus  3d  directionalbinaural sound recording technology  good set headphones  contest  surround sound simply way emulating binaural audio actually achieves  s good experience  actual ampheadphone suggestions  shall leave audiophiles among us   p
hate beats enough  get higher quality sound 14 price sennheiser  dr dre endorsing anything nt  engineering quality equivalent price  rant
yeah  try real headphones 
think lot people unknowingly third party surround  plugins enabled  dts surround setting enabled accident first nt work well  disable third party software use two speaker mode running  s pretty awesome get going  
recommend sennheiser earbuds 
accurate frequency response filtering critical components  oculus making headphones built  beats bose  premium   gamer  headphones fiddle sound add effects change eq poorly recorded sound feels impressive  prevents hrtf working  audio coming application must untouched 
prepare beat  friend  oops  late 
finally  creative basically roadblocked audiorelated advance decade 
thank god
true  aureal got killed lack money lawyer fees rather actually losing patent infringement case 
music playing  please let https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  veajsejungs4
 d liked heard balcony get in room  kind effect still really impressed 
nt  adds lot done well  people decent audio equipment developers would probably put effort  rift may shunt audio games needs 
standalone soundcard used requirement onboard cards caught massively days terms quality s needed anymore cool features used  a3d  eax  etc  nt used anymore s need getting one either  short  long motherboard made last years re probably fine  everything takes advantage good speakersheadphones though  otherwise everything sounds naff 
games like fps good headpones major advantage  prepared accused using wall hack ll able hear enemies coming around wall even know re 
sense would make  sound way s supposed sound  got wrong  hexorg s comment suggests 
defeats point  part magic 3d sound easily distinguish particular sounds background noise  like hear conversation busy restaurantpub   nt tried particular demos  d like contrast 71 sound dolby headphone  meant simulate effect  
doubt  totally breaks immersion stepping open doorway onto balcony music cut immediately 
nope  dns nt resolve 
raytrace  wave  technology proper wave tracing 
heck re looking non hrtf even arma3 positional 3d audio voices  using tfar acre better comms  default direct   even good  hrtf another ballgame 
thank writing interesting response  wish  could give gold  xp
open source openal implementation hrtf built  turned default  even force game 
thinking case would mean oculus supported programs would pretty much garentee 3d sound support instead relying individual devs would cool 
headphones immersion   like  presence  breaking deal one simple reason  add considerable discomfort long gaming sessions  regardless padding quality 
thanks  wonder  though  signal processing techniques used also applied surround system 
m sure comment system  advocating 
agree  given headphones gift  horrible  actually use work hopes someone steal  seems everyone around knows horrible 
nt sound creative 
smothrering baby technology cradle  sinful 
god nt much say patent law

think played italy dust dust2 back 1516 days  ever develop case dementia  song probably large component 
haha  also first thing thought  seriously  d quite fitting 
think re thinking something like lowpass filter   audio occlusion needs calculated m sure working yet guys  audio occlusion music zenith 01   swear  m still working   create checkpoints change lowpass filter s cutoffs upon touched player  s terribly inefficient moment  tried similar plugin really hard get going  need link collision model script  try shape model around everything might bignoteworthy enough occlude sound bounce sound  far know  s plugin yet automatically calculates  since ca nt make assumptions objects architectural  hopefully future ll free plugin like s used  flag floorswallsceilings typical unity tag  done automatically  s really weird hear music fullvolume side wall  s tediousin infancy  s optimal implement singleroom games  onto sound emitters hear distances permit player behind something large  like wall 
naff lol

would certainly problem  think ll see cv1 built design comes around  crescent bay nt exactly made kind extended comfort headphones put  m sure cv1 much refined engineered given bought 360 controller s design team  many seem consider damn comfortable gamepad hope level comfort extend hmd design 
tried good headphones  pair large openair cans hardly noticeable  let alone considerably discomforting  important thing extended use headphones nt actually touch ears 
would require knowing position speakers acoustic properties room  things like interactions sound waves different speakers  sounds reflecting walls would need incorporated simulation even position relation speakers  short  difficult even impossible problem wo nt get solved since headphones technically superior solution  personally d recommend iems  earbuds  headphones cause discomfort 
short   true 3d sound happens brain processes slight differences sounds right ear hearing something right slightly left  bunch small things surround system could never accurately provide  want easiest example look binaural audio barbershop demo youtube compare speakers headphones  demo recorded  effect 3d audio simulating 
51 surround sound 3d tv limited technologically ca nt advance  ca nt generate type experiences headphone 3d sound oculus rift potentially offer 
true nt ebay buy something actually enjoy 
creative greedy
lawyers sure 
yeah
last time got cs ended going 10  degree started living bedsheet arm head holes cut  god effin help bring vr version 
thanks  
could would nt ask mirror  would  
http   missing two links  hence formatting  cheers though  looks interesting 
nt know thing headphones nt touch ears  makemodel recommendations 
hmm  ve listened barber thing headphones  nt wowed  iirc  downloaded high bitrate version  following someone else s recommendation 
true  wrote damage control
problem 
audio technica athad700 probably comfortable headphone ve ever used  re mainly looking comfort  need something goes around ears instead top  openbacked nt create pressure  audio technicas also springy brace nt get pressure headband  re stupidly comfortable 2 minutes  forget re even 
nt know tell  even used cheap earbuds  close eyes demo brain completely tracks sound 3d around  headphones fake surround sound make sure settings thing could suggest 
worth noting make sure  using usb headphones  headphones set regular 2 speaker mode using  virtual  71 setup

btw si en algun momento esto se siente spammy quieren que la corte con los let s play  chiflen  quiero un ban por pesado 
ahora si esta bien o pinta copado el juego  nunca lo agarre porque salio de early access  que tanto puede entretener para agarrarlo asi casualmente  es mejor con un par de amigos 
btw  que estas usando para editar todo  quiero empezar hacer un par de videos onda esto estoy buscando recomendaciones
muy bueno  mire los 3 que posteaste  son un cago de risa  geniales 
hazte una serie de tutoriales  p sigue asi
spammy   steamy  mmmmmmm
ta bien  molesta  asi por ahi se prenden mas postear videos 
lleva mucho tiempo en early access  personalmente lo juego desde 008 llevo cientos de horas jugadas  jamás aburrió  creo que si tuviese que elegir  da best gaem evah  sería este  es single player  hay mods para multiplayer qeu funcionan mas menos tirando menos   por lo que agarrarlo con amigos necesariamente ayuda  en cuanto  casual   te vas divertir seguro  pero si queres lograr algo  llegar la luna volver  vas necesitar mirarte un par de tutorials  casi seguro 
grabo con fraps edito con sony vega grabo voz con sony vega despues le saco el ruido  mic de mierda  con audacity comprimo el render con handbrake  los lleva de 15gb 200mb  suena más paja de lo que es  lo único dificil de instalar es el sony vega  uso el sony vega 11 porque el 13 tenes que dar mil pasos para instalarlo trucho  desenchufar internet  bloquear ips puertos con firewall  eeetc   el 11 es usar un keygen listo 
grasia el de ayer  widespread failure  todavía tiene cabeceando el escritorio 
de hecho  sí  tengo pensado hacer una serie de tutoriales en castellano  ya que lo poco que hay está en ingles yo desactualizado 
wat
jaja  hasta yo frustre cuando pudiste salir de eve     dieron ganas de probar de vuelta el ksp  pero acuerdo que la primera vez que lo probé resulto tedioso jugar solo  si algún día sale algo como eve online meets ksp  voy limarla  p
