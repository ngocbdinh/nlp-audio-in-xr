need move ambisonic sound world vr  binaural ai nt gon na cut
seems confusion around audio vr  specifically respect binaural audio vs ambisonic sound  binaural audio works well content viewer s vantage point controlled camera allows users wearing headphones feel like audio coming around  however  content interactive immersive allows user look direction  work  user turns head binaural audio audio still sound like user looking original direction  ambisonic sound works much better instance uses algorithm determine correct combination 4 directional microphone feeds create sound tune direction user facing  therefore ambisonic sound move user virtual environment binaural audio  mention binaural mics huge creepy ears  see hear  sic  http  3diosoundcomimageshomepageslide1jpg
m going go ahead assume re talking sound capture moviesvideo  agree  ambisonic way go recording moviesvideo  games simulations  sound positions determined avatar position  ve using 3d positional sound monophonic samples gamessimulations 20 years  s need anything different 
binaural creates mpltype issues  eh  good know  talk team  nt settled standard sdk yet

buy pair hrtf headphones  3d virtual sound 
coming across  video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vxavcazjalwa  abchannelpyramind  mike morasky  wanted know could go getting pair headphones producing  even re yet  id like follow progress development able get pair release possible  anyone knows information subject please let know  d love learn 
hrtf algorithm makes binaural noises appear 3d space around  regular headphones  special software  vr game experience good sound design offer form hrtf  edit  lots information audio vr  oculus  dev site   https  developeroculuscomdocumentationaudiosdklatestconceptsaudiointrolocalization

binaural audio unity wwise  3dception

wanted post new demo 3dception  s free non commercial use  lookssounds great  ll try unreal engine  since  virtual barbershop  still believe binaural audio one important keys immersion  tech today s lot easier achieve compared visual immersion 
really ought start learning unity   mean build linux  longer excuse  
fucking time  ve completely obsessed binaural audio implementation games since first found  think great step right direction 
work unreal 
second  s gon na provide whole new level experience gaming  audio way underrated 
definitely binaural audio using wwise ue4 
absolutely  play dayz lot  bad audio nightmare  would good immersion  true binaural positioning also affects gameplay greatly  dayz  s matter life permadeath  lot multiplayer games

one got feeling action behind back instead front 
need stuff like  scary btw immersible heck  much fun  mean genuinely scared long time  please send 
great addition oculus demo night  see blindfolding participants full effect  would also recommend putting stream quality 720p1080p order get full 51 audio stream 
amazing  though feel ended police stand  slide click right head  police yell put gun  last thing hear gun shot  nt notice minute later  waiting return 
listened  well  nt make whole thing though  perhaps m jaded  found hard immersed dialogue pretty cliche often poorly delivered clearly fake accents  s say binaural nature nt impressive  certainly  better actors better script  m sure would ve quite compelling 
mhmm  binaural stereo  meant headearphones  fyi  p 51   s impressive effect  get simulated vr need hrtf enabled sound engine  oculus shown latest demonstrations ces  m looking forward experiencing 
yea  aside poor acting  trying hard make sounds ruined

name s anthony  ve working theatrical sound designer live sound mixer nyc last 5 years  huge binaural audio advocate trying find way make 3d audio accessible affordable  want people much smarter different backgrounds use sound creatively  like visuals  combined serious binaural recording technology pair bluetooth headphones  one capture 3d audio device time  let know ya think  videos  https  wwwyoutubecomchannelucbrvqgl46ga9wmgfytfxncg
interesting  wanted get 3d audio recording point  surprised hear according promotion course consumer price ranged product like  actually expected top smartphones video cameras integrated  looks like interesting product good price  keeping eye 
hooke kickstarter backer  wanted say m looking forward great idea 
s battery life charging 
would possible pair gopro 
back day briefly thing  https  enwikipediaorgwikia3d time really impressed thought gave unfair advantage 1990s first person shooters  failed business technology really cool  especially compared crappy competition creative labs  familiar 
think might relevant place post  nt know guys  care taken audio one things makes games immersive  http  explauralisationorg
shhh shh shhh shhh boxers nt like people talking    bad jokes aside  nice see people tackle 3d audio 
quick question  since binaural recording re really putting two omnidirectional mics headphones  correct  special software process recording  experience type recording imagine  nt see anything mentioned video  depending quality microphone  likely sacrificed get price point re looking  could big market enthusiast concert recordings  thought  pro  version higher end mics 
seems like pretty neat idea  one thing wonder though binaural recording techniques try duplicatemimic ear shape recording sound   see one youtube videos many solutions actual plastic  ears    idea shape human ear  reflectsamplifies  shapes  sound  introduces properties audio  brain looks properties reconstructing spatialness sound  would seem mic headphones exists outside ear canal  would nt able capture properties sound  recall correctly lot  ear shape  aspects spatial height sound location   ie  coming vs  etc   m guess setupdevice would nt give pinpoint 3d sound dimensions  rather mostly 360 degrees   think modern psycoacoustical models try replicate binaural sound  ie  generate fly instead record  use special hrtf math equations try simulate effect sound human ear shape   still super interesting  especially price  definitely novel idea 
hi  anthony  nice video really enjoyed  everything soundoriented always feel differences subtle sound engineers seem get  think training impacts experience product  untrained people really feel difference headphones ordinary stereo headphones  done kind pepsi challenge    best luck 
love idea  software time audio  m still much audio geek quality sound video clips much richer solutions  re vr related sub though wanted ask  applications see field  reason ask ear positions locked person recording hmd sound would nt move  example  someone walks behind 360 video turn look d still sound behind  suitable watching static display  like vr cinema experience  got algorithm based approach adapt audio real time emulate new position  look forwarding seeing things progress  best luck 
still  3d  recording 2 positions  still ca nt hear elevation sound source without information 
interesting project honestly feel ashamed nt come across hooke posted  maybe uncompressedlossless recording samples download 
wan na hear craziest thing  a headphone jack smartphone takes mono  single channel  audio output  could nt plug wired binaural mic even tried binaural needs two channels  stereo  occur  b android ios operating systems natively set act stereo bluetooth sink  meaning  ever wirelessly phones set receive dual channelhigh quality audio  market s never demanded  build firmware ground  think ll make market want invention   
heyo  thanks much continued support  would nt without ya  thank 
right still testing alpha units  re getting 1012 hours continuous battery life  battery life incredibly important developing hooke  could nt feel comfortable going playing backrecording day single charge made inferior product  think something works

wow  nt familiar  thank much sharing comfyhead   great user name btw ha   m hoping making binaural audio readily accessible smartphones via hooke brings masses  thanks 
thanks  ve actually evolved product ensure mic sits within ear  s performing far better silicon ear solutions  listen video used updated alpha set grand central  able hear difference    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v7x8dd9vkwu  index3  listplyp6w6tsgrofz02zbvrs0oyngf0zepp5
s really great question  m sure learned vid  come audio background differences always noticeable  say tho  responses m receiving untrained ears watching 2d 3d comparison phenomenal  people clearly hear difference essentially say  yeah  upgrade sound snapchat  videos  facebook    think way  nt much expertise world video first saw sd video upgrade hd video  knew going back  hope 3d audio  think introducing mobile devices able reach mass appeal 
thanks kinda words  yes  right current hooke verse allows passive vr experience  hooke focused capturing side  currently development affordable solution would enable user capture head tracking 3d audio 
eh  nt really think two positions  also  captures sounds elevation way ears  know airplane flies  look nt know exactly x axis look  s human ears evolved time detect sounds x basis  left right  precisely  reason  many predators attacked us ground  causing ears evolve detect sounds   hooke captures sound way ears  listening back recording plane flying head  ll able detect s exactly    hope makes sense 
hey brum  yes  shoot us email info  hookeaudiocom send lossless files hooke live sessions   ya nt seen em yet  https  wwwyoutubecomplaylist  listplyp6w6tsgrog5f4gwk6neiimmzbl0ctai 
interesting  example video filming recording phone work 
wow  nice  s better would thought honestly  jack charging  buy batteries  seems like could cool product  maybe everyone definitely would cool uses 
considering well able place sounds 3d space even technology accessible households 20 years ago  via  100 sound card  headphones   wonder s worth looking behind project  maybe intellectual property sitting ice somewhere 
android ios operating systems natively set receive dual channel high quality audio wirelessly  market never demanded   ve built custom firmware app allows multi channelhigh quality sink occur  eventually success hooke hope firmware adopted phones natively 
rechargeable lithium ion battery  charges via micro usb cable 
creative sued  lost bankrupted company anyway  ended patents ve sat 20 years  wankers 
ah right manage expand capabilities app alone  s like need change phone s firmware work 
correct  start via app  re already talks oss see first integrate natively   
cool  thought would trickier disabled firmware level  good luck  seems like cool concept

oculus rift audiophiles  hrtf 3d audio 
 audiophile   budget  im using akg q701 headphones  epos epic speakers  m really excited oculus integration real hrtf based 3d audio  even though products high end audio market  tracking head  phones  simulating different speaker setupslistening rooms  cost mucho money  experienced systems  eg smyth realiser  person  seem working extremely well  basically simulate every room speaker setup convincingly  entry price system roughly 3k afaik  really hope technology used oculus cinema app maybe dedicated listeningapp select listening rooms  front fireplace  studio etc  different speaker setups  dolby atmos setup high end 2 channel setups exotic systems  palmer  knowing headphone maniac well  listening yet   
ca nt imagine third party jump chance offer 3k experience fraction cost    listening rooms speaker setup  300  cans  300  dac  5000  speaker setup  part hard time believing even oculus tracking hrtf 3d audio  cans able output godlyness soundwaves really amazing stereo speaker setups  gladly proven wrong 
mmm oculus cinema surround via hrtf 
teaming dolby people another outlet atmos tracks actually brilliant idea
ve using smyth realiser 3 years  incredible piece hardware   first reaction almost always  people convinzed speakers still turned  sound coming headphones  key point device functioning well personalization hrtf  basically re using foamed ear microphones record given listening room hrtf  clear  response listening room ears stored inseparable file  would absolutely killer feature somehow able  achieve personalized hrtfs  3d models head trough camera photography earshead   b  keep separated listening room responses  allowing 1 n relations  would allow sharing listening setups unbelievable realistic quality imply audiophile revolution additionally vr impact  imagine re able listen favorite music virtual recreation something like  http  wwwcinenowinternationalcomeymageimagel000005637jpg excited next couple years seeing direction technology go  starting autumnwinter year  
would probably relatively straightforward produce rift without display  little google glasslike corneroftheeye display  hifi use  better  since bandwidth requirements would much lower headset could probably wireless system could probably made support two headsets simultaneously  s likely ovr anytime soon  mainly priorities lie elsewhere 
head tracker simplifies things lot  lot expense goes high end audio equipment becomes unnecessary  speakers need sound good positions orientations room idea  phones rift need sound good exact position sensors measure  features high end headphones like dsp dynamic eq hurt immersion vr  hrtf absolutely requires accurate frequency response like wearing someone else s prescription glasses vision  conversely accurate frequency response  sufficient levels  thing requires  everything else nt matter  audio exactly matching perceive sound real world  variables audio systems typically deal solved content level 
fair  smyth realiser sophisticated piece tech measures speaker setuproom response  headears headphones using reproduce actual system close possible  one also simulate systems though  sound nuts  seems work indeed  http  wwwsmythresearchcomtechnologyhtml long headphones able reproduce frequencies simulated speaker system see little reason nt come least close  close according reviewers realiser  actual frequency response said setup  nt know actual resolution dsp use  still fact obviously wearing headphones  result could still solution hours might able use speakers  m looking forward testing oculus implementation 
actually  depending ones audiophile orientation  setup needs sound really perfect exactly one location  sweet spot  comfy listening chair  sounds place quite irrelevant  way cans ever able reproduce frequency response low end big expensive speakers  finally  listening music full body experience  sth happens ear  saying cans ca nt sound absolutely wonderful  lot easier get amazing results speakers issues rooms placement  cans never able reproduce experience speakers done really right  really excited promise s come 
excellent example hrtf   3d   audio  presumably similar implemented latest crescent bay
""
s similar lacks real time positional tracking  binary new audio spatial 3d meaning move sound adjusts accordingly position
demo available check oculus spacial audio dk2 
wonder might cause listener s fatigue problems segment users  strong stereo separation effect   nt say m dismissing amazing tech importance accurate audio vr  
m wondering upcoming oculus binaural audio sdk implemented within ue4 
unity download apply oculus sdk separately  imagine audio sdk  ue4  oculus integration built engine  re always one version behind  think wait epic integrate audio sdk engine well  already started working oculus  integrate  would prevent game developers using oculus s positional audio nonvr games  yes know positional audio optimized head tracking  m sure probably still much better currently offered ue4 free right 
mentioned latest unreal twitch broadcast ve hired dedicated audio guy work engine  d say chances good 
m worried implement custom hrtf options different ear  torso shapes  one approach kind tutorial  like building database known parameters made actual test different subjects  hope ideas implement setup would work app 
nt see ue4 s  roadmap   https  trellocombghoonw9iue4roadmap  yet likely release cycle behind official oculus release  still forthcoming  given 47 slated released 23 weeks  early february   might officially supported early  always watch  new commits github   https  githubcomepicgamesunrealengine    
 deleted 
also conforms  statement back   https  forumsunrealenginecomshowthreadphp  54038realspace3daudiocominganytimesoon    architecture ue4 audio system current creates significant challenges integrating plugin  realspace   however  plans begin resolving issues new year  hopefully point plugins type become available  presumably new hiring part plan 
yeah  think saw broadcast  said guy hired knew stuff  rest still lot learn audio  hope wo nt difficult  long  implement current engine  gives hope per interview saw  think iribe   said went back modified crescent bay demos add positional sound  think demos made ue4 
would part oculus sdk something epic would worry  maybe could add kind calibration tool like ipd  ll likely use average head  torso size  etc  virtual barbershop spot  everyone know tried different head sizes  could emulate kind quality one day  d happy 
might epic  sure epic 
really  average settings works back head sides  s binaural demos nt even bother simulate sounds coming front  ear shapes realy crucial thing hrtf made custom setting user  s m worried leave whithout even adressing problem 
nt noticedrealized front coming sounds nt accurate  ll go back relisten binaural demos  nt disagree  customized profile settings would definitely proper way implement  would interesting see could implement calibration tool help define  measurable  settings 
indeed  ve yet see recording simulate sounds coming front believable way

would also like know  quite eager experience  also  seem remember someone able switch track tuscany one  d love know experience tunes 
technolust  way seems like best use binaural audio far  highly recommended 
thanks  check
thanks really nt want spend 30 bucks demo
 30 finished game beta access  trust  s worth 
thanks despite recommendation prefer wait til full release
second  gets access two unique experiences moment  technolust  way  tech demo   technolust  game   game really top notch 
binaural audio oculus films 
yeah  films coming storystudio binaural  positional audio 
yet   lost  demo normal panning stereo  least version tried  hopefully newer stuff use audio sdk 
would surprised nt  better way show technology test audio sdk time 
tried eh  nice  shall look comment history find reaction  could give brief description feelings 
think issue technology licensing nt work unreal yet 
though  ces demo suite uses unreal visisonics positional audio  lost either stereo audio sdk underutilized 
positional  binaural audio vive 
word whether positional  binaural audio feature vive  mean   guessing yes  feature  software engine thing nt  unityue4 etc   heard anything 
s proprietary solution binaural processing vive right  used beta version 3dception plugin two big ears get binaural processing demo  works great  kind processing really needs happen engine level  nt make whole lot sense use completely different solutions hardware platform  said  try new morpheus demo binaural processing solution using excellent 
binauralhrtf audio software based s game developers add games  however creative already excellent algorithm downmixing surround sound stereo binaural audio headphones game  work s perfectly  already use playing games rift definitely adds lot 
oculus said gdc binaural sdk free use anything  specifically including vr headsets nonvr applications  nt reference main oculus sdk

oooooo  1 sony  thats interesting news  read reddit online journalist claiming morpheus best yet  skeptical  perhaps use positional audio tilted feelings  oh god m excited things vr 
glad binaural audio becoming expected standard vr  messed around briefly 3dception plugin results really cool  later tried demo implemented properly mine blownaway  done right  rip headphones find source noise   discovered  tried demo people   haircut  sample 10 years ago  even asking tech nt widely used  patent troll shenanigans read  anyhow s good see guys implementing  truly professional nonabandonnonvaporware vr projects ve following  one polished  one appears made great deal care terms vr comfort immersion  keep great work 
s exciting audio forgotten  s like case 113  perhaps 1111  meaning proper 3d audio super great immersion  demos ve experienced wanting case 3
creative nt algorithm downmixing surround sound  aureal s 3d audio platform raped pillaged    whip  ever feel need 
positionallytracked headphones  oculus audio sdk  best hifi system ever  even playing conventional stereo51whatever audio  sayin  
 posted twitter last week  devkit nt headphones  commercial release detachable ones 
never used aureals 3d ca nt comment  however feel creative s implementation works well   definitely much better companies offerings area atleast  
something heard previously  accounts shoudn  hate creative  kind  seem monopoly sound cards  sure feelings led next 
would amazing watch hear band like re room  guitarist one corner room  drummer another  sudden room turns stage lead singer sold arena 
understand  creative s implementation iswas best re scum  aureal best system  creative sued  bogus  copyright infringement  aureal  legal costs big went bankrupt  creative bought  decided pretty much nothing technology  back around 2000 support quake ii halflife  stuff still nt  unless buy creative soundcard  thank creative fucking binauralhrtf audio almost 15 years 
listen content original 1999 demo cd  http  toniorga3d
almost like  jaunt paul mccartny experience   http  wwwjauntvrcomcontent 
know  honestly idea 
first oculus audio sdk full release  works fine vive well  free solution binaural audio

great news  good audio damn important 
eli5  makes different previous 3d audio solutions  games 3d positional audio ages 
vive probably support steamos launch  audio sdk  nt likely wo nt   https  developeroculuscomdocumentationaudiosdklatestconceptsaudiosdkplatformnotes   careful think operating systems want support future integrating 
true 3d  impression positional  single plane 
oculus sdk really good  documentation   https  developeroculuscomdocumentationaudiosdklatestconceptsaudiointrolocalization  achieve true 3d audio  basic way achieve effect delaying sound one ear since exactly one head unit apart  3d audio last couple years  ability track head  oculus audio emulates reflections shoulders surfaces around  would nt think would make much difference s nt tried demo uses   figure something spatially based noise 
might difference  really idea 
interesting  ability change sounds based position also head oriented  example  interesting  wonder kind sound output device needed simulate  stereo headphones really sufficient 
two ears  71 surround sound headphones gimmick nt know orientation head  help far real thing  sounds hit ears multiple times echos  nt really notice used effect  sound hit ear directly first milliseconds later hit hear reflects objects  allows brain triangulate locate sounds spatially  s link gave  oculus audio basically mimics effect game
