really great video  makes want paddle vs pong waves serves modbox vs anyland hello world  style contraptions 
lol like tell straight audience  fucked youtube blocked  nt beat maps algorithm based rarely ever need actually write beat maps  anyways  excellent comparison video  would nice also put point game text talk easier follow along 
main problem algorithm based beatmaps musicrhythm games far  algorithm done decent job making beatmaps match well music  even poorly done humanmade beatmap feels satisfying play  hits actually beat  patterns matching melody line  real trick make game good enough attract communities beatmappers  like game osu   
wow algorithms nt good enough even notes known separate multiple categories  nt know  thought things like osu used algorithm instead hand crafted beatmaps 
watch comparison video  really see difference algorithmically generated  audio shield  user created  sound boxing   hits audio shield rarely match beat  almost never fit music 
man totally thought games based beat fit music one biggest draws since basically danceexercise beat 
try fit beat  algorithms good  re close enough lot people still enjoy  re musician hardcore musicrhythm game fan  aggravating  games fit well beat music either professionally made beatmaps  amplitude  guitar hero  rockband  bemani games  fanmade beatmaps  osu   soundboxing  stepmania   re casual musicrhythm game fan  probably still enjoy algorithmically generated games  like audioshield  audiosurf  audiosurf 2 algorithmically generated games big advantage letting play along song  professionally made beatmaps limited number often cost extra dlc  fanmade ones inconsistent quality  depend size activity community  fan made beatmaps also require access music  run copyright issues  like ios version osu   removed app store

big deal  spatial audio crucial immersive liveaction experience others  m guessing re using kind standard ambisonic solution based 4channel tetrahedral recordings  livestreaming 360 also big deal nt lot camerastitching solutions actually produce decent quality yet 
unless nt work pc yet  m hearing directional changes move camera around  sounds like basic 2d binaural audio slapped onto 360 video 
oculus storefront youtube app 
start producing 360 videos 8k higher  re absolutely terrible looking hmd  even 4k ones 
could someone test spatial audio rift   work  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vmgsvk0gtgmm  listplu8wphlfhmvcvcbgui3lhc8dufjgvxnn
quote frome article   afternoon youtube announced rolling livestreaming 360degree video  content yet available stereoscopic view consumption vr headsets  soon  addition able livestream 360degree content  sporting events concerts  partners content creators youtube also able add spatial audio  spatial audio provides immersive experience presenting sound based location user within vr environment  drummer behind several feet playing drums  sound different directly front

yes s still like watching divx  s good start though 
resolution nt really issue  4k 114 pixels per degree  angular resolution rift vive  factors like encoding quality  stitching quality  etc  bigger deal  well fundamental limitations equirectangular format poles  look cg video 4k 360 low crf s clean 
far know none desktoppc players support youtube spatial audio yet  youtube app android  use rift  360 video apps like jauntvr app rift spatial audio  principle virtual desktop 360 video player could support youtube s format  support would added 
jaunt supports  milkvr supports  think number single video apps support like baobab s  may others 
guess use package disabler pro kill oculus get youtube app gearvr  s  bad   
nope  say directly google s refusal  possible understand said  memory  search direct quote    personally  would liked youtube  possible corporate reasons  facebook launching 360 video service could enough refusing make bridge google

worth noticing people nt experienced vr headtracking adds new dimension takes  neat    done correctly  eg  ll hear sound somewhere behind  turn head slightly pinpoint  like instinctively time irl  lack static hrtf binaural recordings like never really keep interested long  although neat hearing effect  oh     must    use pair stereo headphones  wo nt work speaker setup 
lol checked http  wwwqsoundcomdemosvirtualbarbershoplonghtm demo eyes closed right seeing    check thanks 
downloaded messed vst plugin oculus made  s really neat  although take effort make good soundscapes  selective kind samples use  also noticed struggles  middle  front rear positions  re using head tracking  nt going problem  game environment s unlikely cause issues  enter pure values listen like  ll notice  middle rear  sounds like s middle  pan tiny bit side ll behind  directly behind nt work  ca nt wait try demos good positional tracking audio work

s classical fronttoback confusion  limited users turn head locate sound source matter milliseconds  maybe make sense emphasize fronttoback difference example applying lowpass filter sound comes behind 
s happens real life  usually nothing sneaks behind us eyes closed brain handle  
brain calculates position audio processing difference sound arriving left right ears  s also ca nt tell sound direction water  sound travels water 5 times faster air s fast brain calculate difference ears  sound source perfectly front behind  sound difference zero  real world though  sound bounce nearby objects  s hard perfect location due small head movements 
m glad people starting realize damn important spacial audio vr  s 3333  wow  visual third   tactile haptic information ll races 
actually  https  developeroculuscomdocumentationaudiosdklatestconceptsospnativeunityscene well sort  unity  fire scene run 
truth sounds pretty much never come straight rear like though  real head movements constant  wo nt really problem 
actually s fact s completely static makes weird  real life heads never sit completely still 
real problem likely scenario set  complete lack even subtle head movements make directionality disappear positions 
thanks  realspace demo nice  finally experiencing positional audio  cool  cemetery demo nt launch dk2 reason  failing  displayshim initialization failure   missed page red green ball demo  try import asset unity got error unity 51  update 53 try

yes  one best parts farlands  always find bugs listening  find still usually takes 30 seconds spot visually  audio really great 
yup  s way find 
tried pixarlike scene dreamdeck  seriously work  opposite experience  direction works perfectly s dropoff feels unnatural 
oddly enough game really wow 3d audio  pinballfx2  never would thought  moment looked pinball table speakers sounded exactly like would real life cabinet pinball table  almost like coming top head looking makes sense   instapresence  completely tell exactly sound coming  titles  like think much visual stimuli mes effect

 s perfect experiences far  s still massive presence multiplier usually close enough works  always locate things sound  even s always pinpoint accurate  could also re generalized hrtf model used people  hrtf never exact unless modeled head  s usually close enough 
havent tried henry 51  rift headphones   guess s list things  curious denon make s 
henry pretty darn good 51  quite right positioning  cant blame given weird speaker setup

oculus standard 3d audio could use  m really hoping someone working rift potentially gear vr media playing device 
even headtracked spacialized stereo would  since already provided stereo  s licensing reasons could nt  might processing budget reasons  think would worth 
yes  creative soundblaster motherboard  really works well games movies spacialization  hope bypassed oculus sdk

reason use oculus audio sdk  especially ambisonics support

oculus made audio sdk allows  place  mono sound sources around scene react changes position  even sounds position attached moving entity enemy game well head rotation  end result pretty fantastic   s pretty lengthy video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  viawfn9sfcso  binaural  recordings  less useful  2 mics used  ca nt respond changes positionlocationhead rotation

pretty sure  games experiences rift vive make use  s something s brought much visual stuff

yep  oculus s audio sdk dragndrop solution vr games good approximation binaural audio s called hrtfs  addition 3d spatialization others mentioning  decent vr game expected implement alternative  course  s still room improvement binaural audio  s going sound quite realistic enough yet  oculus set good baseline headphones  audio plugin

grind exists heads people want grind progress get the best stuff   ve playing casually since beta  middle ranked stuff  galaxy followed several career paths  enjoyed every minute  enjoy game would never force play earn virtual money pegged enjoyment super ship  ll never top pvper  like ride vr emphasises playstyle  however learning curve need put least 10 hours game competent  anyway  s see  feels right   
luck 
nt want surround sound vr  want full positional audio head transfer function  occlusion room reflection  game engine full control sound processing simple sound chip takes plain stereo outputs headphones enhancements  
thought describing better hrtf implementation stereo  guess s nice vrnative games vr runtime provides facility  elite also 2d use case cater 
agreed  would go far say elite dangerous still favourite vr experience  already great audio visual ambience  vr  use good headphones prefer ones cover ears  enhances everything 
thanks  still great game though 
merci buckets 
also oc970 play e  flag  always reprojection   roomscale game  along  async reprojection   allows play vr ultra settings  hmd quality 125 steamvr ss 1012 
 interleaved also use async repro  nt counterproductive also interleaved one 
ah  interesting  would cool saw hands  nt think anything yet 
thanks headsup  nonetheless 
 uploaded 24 hour livestream part annoyingly cropped segment contained  community team holiday monday s epic stream  however tested beta  says tin  could go capturing uploading next days 
yes  well hrtf also stereo  3 also  problem  2d game actually  hence switch oculus spatialiser  well  suppose  going thousand sound cues adding bool  switch second output   p
still get juddering nt turn s magic going 
game avatar s handsarms move hotas units  occasionally stretching  animation  played first kbm  gamepad  2 years hotaspedals  recently ve added chair arm mounts  say possible play high level gamepad kbm  vr  nothing beats controls fingertips physicality wrestling stick get attacker sights escape interdiction 
would awesome  m really looking forward hearing difference   
s pity aureal sound cards nt popular  phenomenally good positional audio room reflections occlusion hardware 15 years ago 
ve pain abstracting multiple sound engines linux desktop runtime compile time horrible  end supporting nothing right  going support time 
oh interesting  ve got game installed  holding playing hotas  since doubt santa paid attention anything wanted  ll need pick one play damn thing break  done mil flight sims thanks uncle  nothing like 360 view  cockpit  closest thing  reality intruding fighting stick get lock 
best headphones spatial audio 
us time vivesvr general  headphones using  m using sony gold wireless stereo headphones ps4  love sometimes re like earmuffs live fl 
answer question literally  sennheiser hd 800 realistic option look sennheiser hd 598   edit  someone posted deleted comment headphone amps hd 598 answer question  yes headphones would sound better dedicated amp  plenty loud enough vive 
m still using earbuds ship vive  ve attached headset straps dangling ready insert know push right  find fine 
earbuds best bet re worried earmuffs  still hold heat nearly much  got samson sr850 re  50 raved audio quality rheadphones  wanted something let hear environment  could demo  sounded good  felt comfortable  recommendations break bank opinion  need something whip around  sweat   sweat  money spent  side note  play high humidity  high temperature environments use plenty fans around play space  well custom vr cover made felt  ve walked away minimum cleanup besides replacing felt   m also thin male  mileage may vary  
open backed headphones best spacial audio  make audio appear originate outside headphones  dont get crappy surround sound headphones  get 6 small crappy speakers  way trying simulate surround  hearing works  get decent pair audiophile headphones  way get pair good quality speakers  sennheiser audio technica s budget headphones generally good  50100 bucks get really nice pair  pair sennheiser rs220 s  cheap  best open backed wireless headphones get  sennheiser wired headphones  give similar audio quality  fraction cost 
stereo headphones 
ll getting vive next month  vr  good headphones good headphones  use akg q701 outstanding sound stage flat response  btw also live florida  q701 let ears sweat since open back 
http  wwwheadfiorgt534479madlustenvysheadphonegamingguide3182016mrspeakersetherc11added
akg k712 also great soundstage 
use hyperx cloud velvet pads 
 hd598 market  would choice also 
598s fantastic spatial audio terrible vr generally barely clamp pressure  use effectively need use band secured around  put headband vive straps  options unwieldy 
thank  might pick hd598 
looking get hands open headphones  may stupid question goes  mainly game computer  astro a50s absolutely love  sound great  bass super punchy shakes ears bit love wireless  willing let go wireless think match astros sound possibly giving better sound  yeah 598s work gaming 
yes  openbacked headphones much better realism  also convenient vr actually hear talk people room headphones 
deleted comment mine  sorry  odd doubts reading reviews  quickly decided delete comment  reason  thank much  info helps ton 
hd 598 s compare sony s mdrv6 mdr7506 
reporting back say received headphones today  absolutely love  fantastic recommendation 
would compare astro a50s  know audiophiles would cringe question love astros  give exactly want headphone great clear sound great bass  get results audiophile headphones 
re going drop  300 headphones nt get sennheisers  severely lack comfort huge vr  anything 300  bose   https  wwwamazoncombosequietcomfortacousticcancellingheadphonesdpb00m1neukkrefsr12  selectronics  ieutf8  qid1471374755  sr12  keywordsboseqc25 
598s would agree  tendency slide forwards backwards head lot  also feel like bulky use vive  really sound great ergonomically nt best vive imo 
thing  good  headphones little bass quantity compared used  consumers care bass quantity quality rest frequencies  go store highend headphones try investing much money  bottom line  audiophile s standpoint  hd598 headphones sound much better a50s nt even funny  thing re used ton bass teeny soundstage hd589 balanced amount bass huge soundstage  s question whether sound quality better hd598  question whether better preferences  go try pair somewhere 
well hd 598 open back s isolation  larger soundstage d say sound better overall 
m glad like  ca nt wait hd 800s come mail tomorrow 
audiophile  spend bit extra get quality products  a50 s cant compare decent set stereo headphones  rs220 probably comparable wired hd598 sound quality wise  either blows a50 s water  71 headphones gimmick  squeeze multiple smaller speakers tiny space  obviously give lower sound quality  get much better speakers stereo set  know people dont like hear purchases may best  especially cost much  try quality set cans immediately notice difference  way 71 headphones trying create surround sound  human hearing works  reason people completely lose hearing one ear  also lose ability place sounds  place sounds slight difference time takes sound reach ear  10 crappy speakers ear never recreate 
worn sennheiser s day  numerous occasions  comfortable headphones ever owned  sure basing claim  owner pair sennheiser s  tell wrong 
598se comfortable headphones ve ever worn 
go try  makes sense might used heavy bass  willing change makes better overall sound 
haha damn well makes sense  really looking forward trying hd598s  need separate amplifier well 
 quickly see missing whole lot  heavy bass muddies every sound  much better appreciation music start notice sounds could nt hear  bass  like every aspect song  clear  overpowering  another benefit hd598  removable lead  pick one foot lead use vive 
definitely wont need amp  fairly low impedance  50ohms   pretty much anything drive  work phone even  though open ear  really suited listening stuff public  everyone around able hear everything 
awesome  thanks tips
ok great  need find store test babies buying 
vr audio question  binaural sound work 
m sure heard binaural youtube videos simulate getting haircut like hearing scissors move space around  wondering spatial audio like integrated vr games yet   virtual barber shop  audio  use headphones  close ur eyes    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  viudtlvagjja  listul  t2m30s 
check talk chet faliszek  works valve   talks topic detail  even references barber shop video  starts 855 https  youtubeo8ea6nqxny4  t8m55s
yes  spatial audio integrated vr game worth salt  space pirate trainer audio queues robots floating around know field view  nice thing vr  since head tracked  sounds stuck head way youtube demonstrations 
integrated works  could work better earphones would understand precise shape ears  every human s ears different makes difference 3d source sound perceived  
two reasons 3d audio nowhere near people expect  first  sound waves reflect bounce around environment many times  two points space ears located  d need calculate interference delays multiple reflections influence physical properties objects bounced  every single sound  s like asking nt realtime ray tracers graphics yet  nt kind computational power dedicate  second problem audio location dealt brain delay sound reaching ears also additional influence shape head  shoulders pinna unique  give example much rely anatomy  someone s lost ear experience period poor sound location brain adjusts differences never recover fully frontback resolution  ears face sides forwards   s real easy way demonstrate strong effect  put music grab hold ears  pull around listening dramatically frequency content shifts  university surrey used high resolution 3d capture customise hrirs individuals demonstrated improvement generic model  s still good way behind spatial resolution experienced real life  tl  dr convincing 3d audio least decade away mean time re stuck basic approximations pretty fake sounding 
ve yet play game  nt  use 3d audio 
actually pretty sad  research  directional sound  dont truely 3d audio  achieve truely 3d audio need dedicated sound card  us probably know bit  graphics cards blew sound quality  directionality  kind went back burner  chips include onboard sound integration  well powerfull enough truly immersive audio  get truely 3d audio game  able detect sound started  objects sound encounter reaching person hears  would become pretty taxing system  games directional audio  well done  soundscapes sound immersive sound actually calculated going hear every second  think game like arma  sniper 900 meters  shoots  sound travel 360 degrees outward  immediately sound going affected shooter s body  ground pulled trigger  sound travels outward hits trees  plants buildings  besides target 4 people hear  person facing directly toward shooter  500 away going completely different perspective sound dependent shooter  even change elevation  bit rant  bug people think incredible game audio  really shitty  play arma often times get cqb environments get pissed hear directionality foot steps  cant tell weather   often times hard even tell weather right front right behind  3d audio fixes actually taking effect way ears facing effects sound 
soundblaster cmss3d obsolete  disable playing even matter  feel like great lack information regarding games natively bakedin binaural audio games nt  nt heard anything discussed us sound cards virtual surround sound technologies like cmss3d dolby headphone   m using vive nt get audio normal headphone jack computer connected soundblaster card  plug vive s audio jack get sound  assume sound card equation using vive anyways 
stereo best  forget virtual surround sound effect 
planning use source based 3d positional sound like use cs  go shitty experience  sound immensely important csgo  positional audio unreliable accurate 
feel like sounds spt nt work well  stereo limited ca nt discern direction  best directional sound heard oculus  dreamdeck 
note 3d audio based algorhithms direction typically sounds  whereas virtual barbershop pinnaebased  recorded microphone inside mold actual ear   ve never heard sound amount 3d effect outside virtual barbershop 
work sound system  ve ever used earphones  thinking audio go sound system
ossic headphones claim  currently kickstarter  estimated availability fall  m sure well actually work  would make even immersive experience could true spatial audio  even  nice studio headphones  still sounds like m wearing headphones  say  still sounds pretty much like sound coming inside head  close  want something actually makes sounds distance sound like actually coming far away 
please tell know game bakedin binaural audio  true would cmss3d dolby headphone exist  referring solely vr games  still would curious know true 
 objects red  know video games use color like    ve yet play game  nt  use colors  
oh another quick thing  think  hear plane hellicopter flying real life pretty quickly pinpoint sound  visually  games like arma right get idea coming  often times find looking around way long  helicopter already right top 
said sound travelling 360 degrees true light well  games simulate light player s perspective many frames per second  highly doubt thing sound taxing  even  games nt use much cpu  nt think would problematic  least option   s people nt bothered program sound characteristics objects s lot effort something people nt often demand  chet said  s game designer implement properly 
binaural beats work headphones
kickstarter ended  preorder  got end kickstarter mine due february 
3d binaural one  fact binaural beat meant varying effects brain  dont sound like music voices  basically different sound wave playing ear  sounds mixed pleasant listen however  edit  link  description explains bit better  https  youtube8fadwhmghvk second edit  apparently im incorrect  binaural 3d audio  however  binaural beats  binaural audio thing 3d audio  google 
game  baked  binaural audio  s approximated using crude hrtf filter much inferior real life sounds accurately ll able spatially resolve audio 
re kinda comparison  graphics nt calculated like  re describing raytracing used prohibility expensive calculate 
research months back  said computer would calculate perspective matters correct  also said  said game developers properly incorporate game  however game end really give information location  loud sound  obstacles would encounter way  computer math  figure kind cues needs send give proper 3d sound  way understood properly implement sound way op questioning would require sound card due complicated calculations would run  really game designers end dont know much info would add object sound could encounter  honestly bet sound card could calculate based already present characteristics  example  already see bullet penetration varying levels games  concrete keeps bullets passing plywood easily penetrated  would known density  sound card runs calculation determine sound like hitting object  continues object bounced  top sound could still traveling obstacle  around sides obstacle sound card would still calculate thats going sound user standing directly opposite  think heavily underestimating complexity sound  least much sound plays environment  calculate every sound going hit ears  direction sound compared person hearing  would lot calculations going constantly  haha maybe massively underestimating current processing power  honestly think added true three dimensional sound game like arma 3 might lose half player base processor would nope fuck 
http  wwwpcgamercom3daudioisbackandvrneedsit
ok  m still left wondering know status game s 3d audio lack thereof
perhaps rephrase  games binaural audio without need special sound card 
re right  clearly wrong impression thought actually shading games worked days  reevaluating comment think something interesting though  light effectively instant  game world  speed nt factor obvious reasons  whereas sound travels relatively slowly  result  truly accurate 3d audio would nt series acoustic transformations  would take time account  eg  gunshot sound would travel directly toward player  would also reflect distant surroundings back gunshots damn loud  therefore creating echo sounds sometime initial gunshot sound heard player   nt take time account  nt think would expensive calculate   well m sure d efficiently

side side comparison audioshield soundboxing
""
nothing ve played audioshield makes lick sense  s random orbs hit music chose happens running background  tried recently could nt even finish songs chose  audioshield gathers dust steam list  known steams return policy worked would returned months ago  tried soundboxing weeks ago instantly liked  amount songs exploded talk using local files like stepmania osu  s winner mile  give little polish wo nt competition 
fan sb due lack local music support  anything elite without mod inst going compare user generated beatmap  plus  sound miss note sb drives nuts  totally takes away music game  best comparison video 
audioshield looks much nicer graphically soundboxing looks like play actual rhythm rely usersthe user create map  think said need make map 1 take  true  mess need start whole song  way edit  tempted get audioshield think ll get soundboxing  especially way edit map
holodance still notch added osu beatmaps support imo  audioshield lackluster visual rhythm comparison hd  soundboxing  although amazing rhythm still needs stronger editor  much better visuals optimization  honestly  three d go holodance 1st  soundboxing second audioshield  3 
get bad beatmap nt use rhythm mod  even use mod people say s good enough  solve rhythm issue  sb use youtube  means hardly play songs youtube allow upload  s  focus quality  pick sb make beatmap  focus quantity  pick remember download mod reddit  like rodin says  nt worry quality  ve got quantity 
soundboxing looks busy opinion  audioshield use difficult mods s frantic soundboxing  d like see comparison speedsettings
want enjoy audioshield need find songs work best  really damn good  btw always run hardest possible setting  way  experience audioshield works best metal  symphonic metal  nightwish  harder black metal  since pretty much listen anyway great  audioshield miles ahead soundboxing holodance comes slick minimalist style though 
audioshield dev took effect miss note d added last patch everyone complained  problem never added original effect back  far tell s way know miss note 
good know sound  got lot feedback playtesters beta versions nt obvious enough missed note  made bit obnoxious  see use case customizations sound  s list add settings panel  coming soon support features development 
talk soundboxing using local material  look  
get holodance  osu beatmaps support great 
rhythm mod 
hey  man  bought played soundboxing  enjoyed  issues audio sometimes slowed mid song really threw timing  known issue  addressed

looking use soundstage professional mixing tool  might want look elsewhere  32 kind limiting serious sequencing work  note every device  audio emitting  even splitters   uses audio channel  simple  well  sort simple  twospeed 20 input sequencer  2 sequencers  10 x   20 samplers  one every sequencer input  5 sampler mixers  allow turning volume easily  2 final mixers  required  useful  assign drum samples one mixer turn drums  example  equals total 29 audio channels  leaves 3 spare devices play  keep mind soundstage needs aux channel  output   really 2 free devices  unless somehow plug everything one last final mixer   maybe s windows limit m aware  s true think different ways get around limit  soundstage dev  take note  actually work  please consider implementing    mixer  steal  audio channels plugged   mixer attaches first sound channel given  next 3 sound channels  collapsed  mixer s sound channel  slider mixer particular channel decides volume sound mixer channel  could take 16 sampler inputs collapse 4  counting final mixer   automatically assign 32 audio channels volume  final output  take sound s volume  matches particular volume level  send sound channel particular volume level  granted  31 kind hard divide  option nt really feasible considering 4 instruments full volume could enough make  full volume  sound channel useless   unregister idle sound channels  x seconds  device played audio  input  last  say  30 seconds  temporarily disable device s audio channel  probably laziest solution  still would nt allow serious sequencing work   create register separate dummy program 32 audio channels  probably unfeasible  would immediately give 64 audio channels  64 probably would ever need unless want start introducing tons recorders hold loops temorarily  even could save loops samples free back  daws works  mostly fine   windows devices dummy programs nt responding  goes extra audio channels     please nt bash soundstage s dev  s really cool program  could get people looking daws  music generation general    15  frankly  d happy paying  30 soundstage 64 audio channels 
great observations  m working  deregistering  devices nt emitting sound  s output wired nt count one 32   32 channel limit effect using unity s built audioengine  ll see set 64 next update  include build notes   intend move 3rd part audio engine 10 m trying dump much work something works unity  thank notes get chance reviews always appreciated   logan
might get goes sale add organs someone gives easy way  want make music like interstellar  wont able well game cant even imagine like real organ would still enjoy messing 
way record new loop sequencer  make something like  boom boom tch   save loop  hook sequencer recording thing  never records anything 
got videos people using 64 audio channels  seems like  overkill 
s awesome hear  even better solution one suggested   suspicious unity involved often sound mixing issues like result lackluster audio backends coming engines like unity unreal  cases s fault game dev  s fault engine creators using audio engine quality everything else  nt think ll able change audio channel limit  least easily   read  rewriting lot audio code handle increased channel limit  created devices count toward audio channel limit would solve channel limit entirely would make 64 channel limit nil  something else ve run  although s definitely huge issue  wish could give sampler two different inputs  way  sampler feeds two different sequencers  sequencer drum trigger manually  example  quickly testing want two drum beats pattern four  without fumble around sequencer   way could trigger sampler  say  two differentspeed sequencers 
s  quite right  outputs side last block sequencer loop  hook mixer  hook mixer s output recorder 
soundstage s instruments nt work like daw s instrument  get samples play back  want five different pitches guitar string  s five different samplers  means five audio channels get used   six  counting sampler  three  switch sequencer setup piano  recorder  sampler   example 64 channels relating soundstage sequencing work  take look kevin macleod s work  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vrg5rtlikc7k https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vpy3iooiqkxm replicating soundstage without using sequencer lots samplers would incredibly hard  since 31 inputs  nt nearly enough full range pitches instruments time  mean  maybe could 16 pianos  time nearly exactly   hitting 4 buttons exactly tick   nt want looping audio  d stick two  eight mixers  instruments activating time  d still need recorders soundstage would allow 
m going make splitter merger  well  hopefully solves latter problem  thanks feedback 
aaahhhh
supposedly piano roll next update nt need sampler pitch  1 sampler 
tune  ☐ changed ☑ changed
would solve issue entirely   piano roll sampler embedded  nt need audio channel 
piano roll coming 
changing audio device upon exiting vr used work  nt physically unplug vive get computer s sound back
gives  used work  nt 
personally run vive audio way around  keep desktop s audio default mirror vive s usb audio  way s swapping back forth  windows seems pretty finicky  also seem better separate volume control way  although generally set via devices leave 
steamvr still set change back device want  double check settingsaudio
mirror audio anyhow stops issue
keep headphones plugged vive 
yeah   unchanged
correct wrong applicable headphones plugged vive  right 
nope  plug time put 
m totally sure mine always  rate applies steam vr turned avoids constant switching back forth sources 
see problem  know mirror pc audio vive s headset jack m using vive need use pc s headphone jack utilize soundblaster card cmss3d virtual surround sound m gaming monitor  apparently  unless physically unplug vive sound still routed even though ve exited steamvr despite choosing option switch audio back soundblaster upon exiting steamvr 
built htc vive audio dac sound like 
ve wondering good board audio dac htc vive  16 bit 48khz card  24bit  lot power behind drive larger headphones  pair audeze el8s would like use  assuming nt prove cumbersome use  would nice nt run separate cable audio 
review htc a9  flagship phone  m willing bet wo nt include dac lower quality    htc nt lost commitment audio quality  internal dac  amplifier headphone port tweaked a9   also supports hires music  24bit192khz  across popular file formats  dolby audio equalisers introduced m9 make welcome return   source   http  wwwwhathificomhtconea9review  2akywis1kkolx0gy99 
m concerned amp  wan na use sennheisers
long re 32 ohm re sure work  think go 60 ohm still sure ll work ca nt say 100  sure  drive without dedicated amp   using phone  pc kind player  yes nt think worry  sennheisers talking 
hd 650  300 ohms
re gon na need amp use  nt know s added latency portable amps would probably best bet 
true  beyerdynamic dt 990 600 ohm work phone  ipod touch laptop  volume lower dacamp malfunction audio wise  vr volume enough  maybe except gun fire stuff like  please test headphones vive wait anyone else test improvising purchasing portable amp 
said nothing  audio malfunctions  using high impedance headphones source meant lower impedance devices  999  cases  result lower volume sound  sound gap extreme   proper volume control imo necessity  low imp  headphones high imp  sources result awful faulty sound  hope nobody would go buy stuff like portable amp without actually testing equipment first  took given  would unwise potentially waste money 
agree   wanted clarify wrote   re gon na need amp use   clarified  case 
yeah probably said  d use amp   guideline interested  get pair headphones  sound quality  want source deliver around 18th headphones imp   less fine higher sound quality affected  
m audiophile  bose soundsport really good audio solution vive s sale  50 prime day
thought d bring since m using right bought full price regrets  s good enough m tempted buy second one back well  know people really care sound quality give bose lot crap honestly ve consistently made average stuff reasonable prices  m looking time  coming someone hated ear headphones general  re stuffy uncomfortable yank minutes  including htc s  2 headphones stuff vive box  yet  feel perfectly fine headphones  mostly brace ear stay place sits comfortably outside ears  mean seal tight outside noise leaks  nt leak enough distracting honestly d rather aware something outside vr going  good demo situations  particular soundsport nt microphones audio controls  actually good nt want added bulk tangle vive  cord also short enough tangle long enough hang around pull headset  s also tactile difference left right earphones  bit tape use mark one cables fixes pretty easily   obligatory link   https  wwwamazoncombosesoundsportinearheadphonescharcoaldpb011ih5zhgrefsr14  saht  ieutf8  qid1468354677  sr14  keywordsbosesoundsport   ll need amazon prime member get 50  price mentioned   nbsp  headphones tried vive comparison   sennheiser urbanite xl   https  wwwamazoncomsennheiserurbanitexloverearheadphonesdpb00m3nzka2  much better seal sounds  slightly  better  s heavy s well balanced still gets stuffy long sessions combination headset  audio cord also stiff  flat  long enough annoying  volume controls sort got way well   sony mdrxd150   https  wwwamazoncomgpproductb00ko5fooi  relatively lot cheaper lighter terms quality also sort get paid 
use bose headphones  prefer nt go way ear canal  makes sharing less gross  also sound great  ones include mic  makes easy figure bud goes ear headset 
yes definitely worth  best inear headphones ever super comfortable 
go sale  already 
thanks pointer  grabbed uk sale ended  much comfortable 
looks like s sold sale   m sure s good options well 
glad like  ear headphones nice  something active vive ear headphones seem perfect fit 
audio vive always sound gimped 
ve tried several pairs headphones reason vive makes sound cheap crappy
sure applies  m using windows 10 noticed two playback devices sound settings vive  output set  htcvivec  audio sounds horrible  always use  speakers usb audio device  improves quality lot  believe  htcvivec  hdmi  speakers  usb  default names  least   give shot 
strange  nt problem audio  sounds great earbuds comes vive
sounds like re using try hdmi audio using usbvice versa  make sure bitrate set cd quality  higher lower
steamvr audio settings checkbox called  enable gain reduction  pretty large impact sound  try unchecking box well using usb instead hdmi output 
sound options always threw  ve tried hdmi usb ca nt tell difference
helped actually lol thank 
vive  audio device  gone  sound vr 
 change anything  played last night everything fine  booted steam vr today along project cars sound  vive usb audio device gone computer  steamvr settings go usb section hit  refresh  everything lights white except  audio device  stays gray  ve tried uninstalling drivers steamvr settings panel changing usb port  still nothing  tried usb 20 always usb 30  change  anyone ideas  m really getting sick debug software hour every hour vr time  s absolutely ridiculous working perfect last time played  quit steamvr nt even shut computer  came back today audio device driver  get together valve

 took one adapters plug microphone jack pc end red white plug  rca audio cables   plugged home theater receiver  71 sound setup  course  nt get positional audio via method  wondering buy long hdmi cable  use say dvi hdmi adapter video card  run way home theater receiver  would positional audio translate  example  turn head north south  hear sound coming surround speakers instead front speakers  positional audio completely equation re using anything headphones plugged hmd 
audio positional mirrored speakers  audio stream tell 
also positional audio serving 71 rig entirely dependent upon stereo system configurationsettings  ie  knows work well sound good   d stick stereo 
confirmed 
well  tried stereo output headphone jack routed main stereo tell nt positional  m wondering maybe would work used hdmi cable something  cause know headphone jack output nt give positional audio 
settings windows steam  talking settings receiver  sticking stereo  s positional  headphones  s positional  s way s supposed  m wondering way get working 71 speakers room  like  turn head  entire sound imaging room change fly  definitely nt using headphone jack via stereo marantz receiver

really want play games  download roms assign cabinets arcade builder  might even get lucky find art ready use pack uploaded  assign art arcade builder cabinet 
 deleted 
way things got complicated  heard missing many required licenses music game  love listening 
since xbox controllers work  reckon usb controller would work well  also  tab  cabinet customize input 
walking game without moving real life makes instasick  teleportation lightning fast brain hardly notices happening far getting sick  pretty much experience get 
 going super vr noob question  especially since nt used vr headset yet  teleporting position better able walk  people limited play space real life  teleporting one many solutions created get around issue  solutions development 
depends user general disconnect created teleporting preferred motion sickness caused controller based locomotion  varies user user game game  ve used solus project find using trackpad good large areas tend stick teleporting smaller areas avoid motion sickness 
add rom want  replace cabinet s assignment arcade builder  also change cabinet art  said  attract video change complicated fix 
get outta
yeah  ve waiting 
ah see  thanks hard work us lazy people  m town buying game come home upload 
ok  s way use xbox controller  means ll either put vive controllers physical table  blind   leave dangling wrists using old controller  ideal  thanks 
settings change fix  different rom 
excellent  fyi drove sale nra yesterday busy dad nt time messing roms 
saw bunch snes games file swell  seemed bound correct cart make arcade configuator  even emulator files 
update recently possibly broken  longer works  get  failed open descriptor file  newretroarcadeuproject  message
good reason  illegally sharing games 
s easy using arcade builder  might lucky find art pack already  attract video wo nt change m afraid

 wait 20 years oldies 
fuck  like wandering led zep concert asking play lady gaga covers shit  edit  ok  missed joke preceding post  bad 
 say walk  mean controller  physically walk 
m confused  piracy 
think still walk around using xbox controller vive  way oculus users play  yeah  using controller 
even use another controller  entire point simulate playing arcade  use vive controllers 
use vive camera put disable ve got position found  
fixed    run cabinet normally  hit tab keyboard  select video display options  select  ll able see screens  ideally  placed rom  special  cabinet ie  vertical ones 
impossible  d clean uninstall  delete files folder  reinstall unzip newretroarcade  nt worry ll worth 
games obtainable legally 
ok cool thanks  devs really invest time covertly releasing themed packs like  racing  adventure  action  classics etc community  people would willing hostmirror m sure  know many fine altering files inserting new content  thousands  like nt time ability learn ins outs 
important questions  saying ca nt add attract videos newother roms  shadow dancer  example   manually textedit settings   also  way assign lightgun cabinets  like settings cabinet  games like lethal enforcers  expand arcade roomsfloorscabinets   30 cabinets  lastly  way move start games via arcade stick gamepad  looking around vive 
1 think joke 2 bad analogy 
realize kidding right  also  s like 
nobody said nt  shhhhh
hm  tried briefly yesterday  luck  ll check settings 
s way better 360 pad  played yesterday completed final fight glorious  stick adds immersion far responsive godawful twitchy gameplay mechanics platformers 
love vive controllers  particular experience think sticks controller work lot better  closer resemble original experience 
save something ll need time play 
restoring original content saved folders allows game launch arcade editor launch  ll give another shot tomorrow sometime soon far  dice 
would nt dare legal issues surrounding roms  problem roms nt even purchasable even want buy  almost exclusively available backdoors 
would incredible  d awesome see games like time crisis added  know would incredibly challenging though 
change attract videos  need file  replace one want  use special tool render video 
 http  steamcommunitycomgames465780announcementsdetail832425837791215928
need add command line steam  seatedvr  something like
ah  opinion  nt understand realized could default way  nt like  misunderstood  okay  answer question  yes s ideal   unfortunately  issue vive controllers  personally  assume others well  since nt seem many complaints along lines 
fair enough  though completely disagree 
mate  already many roms package  would nt know  
oh understand problem joeblogs33  popping forums new downloadable package made everyone  know legally could nt officially behind scenes pushing  0 
true  except snk sega genesis roms  sold totally legit  actually  sega s genesis packs steam literally roms humble snk bundle s games  could easily build legit  100  legal kick ass arcade sega genesis snk roms alone 
actually currently working lightgun support  believe time crisis one testing 
ok possible  bit complicated  upvoted  thanks clarifying  s hoped  know answers things    s ok wondering  
awesome  thanks  
vive controls pretty awful controller lot games  xbox controller  arcade stick  way better  get game want play put vive wands pocket play 
   s big guy 
ideally d love able use vive wand way use arcade machine lab 
well actually commend integrity  yeah  would quadrupled sales launch day 
well nra developer d seriously offer option purchase roms ingame easy way automatically import along cabinet art 
awesome  ca nt wait 
ca nt expand cabinets  ca nt assign gun cabinet unfortunately  wanted time crisis 
alterantively  wear wrist straps  nt really need put vive controllers somewhere  let dangle  s 
thinking know s way could bothered create arcade scratch dig around folders looking arcadebuilderexe google load instructions  lot people probably would nt want risk downloading illegal roms dodgy websites either possibly infecting computers  especially already confident pcs  make niche gaming experience highly accessible  bloody good fun  everyone m really greatful  
except nt  snk sega  doubt easy way  app  purchases another company s games let along import files steam games  guess steam really would nt allow kind access app another   however  buy sega ones buying genesis packs steam  snk ones humble bundle  steam sale individually  m sure still permanent sale anywhere

export textures  simplified version textures  fbx export nt include animations  saving waveforms used interesting idea  would imagine bandwidth saving would prohibitive  though  another idea would take raw sketch done tilt brush write audio reactive shaders app  touchdesigner  maya  etc   ve seen amazing things people done tilt brush sketches apps like  rendering ambient occlusion   https  twittercomsougwenstatus760199564263587841   animating   https  twittercomsteveteepsstatus756371251992506368  
nt heard vramp  also  drew patrick thinking  audio reactive brushes back 2014   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vbzohrluqbbc   nt think copying app looks great  best luck  d love see tons successful apps vr  s also  wave   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vtoijh7gc9pu   chance try  also cool  check 
yes  invented   lines bouncing sound    http  randomwallpapersnetoscilloscopeartistic1920x1080wallpaper302947jpg 
might look pr guy  basically opposite selling game 
tilt brush s main competitor  keep fight   btw  vramp great  
still love vramp  especially dynamic background  idea next beta update might 
need multiplayer tiltbrush 
give man award  sounds brilliant 
hey guy said  drawing controllers 
everyone wearing vr tripping e sounds like good time 
yea  make good point  basically much vr edm  events offer real experience  cheaper more accessible more stimulating  personal dj like said safer more money made world more options different djsmusic choose recorded shows  experience anytime  relive best experience  even watching exact experience multiple perspectives social gatherings people world see similar altspacevr  way polished  tuned dance music  higher visual fidelity  would 100  welcome  married kids  likely never go real rave ever  used go 4 times year back early 2000s  spend good 3 hour session time  home 
guys tried allowing mic audio input well  would imagine d lead trippylike experiences 
favorite person today  thank much 
yes 
 electricity  better version plasma  good  worried plasma favorite 
video also shows kind  layers   ie  flat area made small arrows  allow painting 2d – totally miss feature like  chance added future 
aw man loved taffy  amazing update though 
awesome  thanks  nt zoom vertical  teleportation  right   also  guys list features development 
bandwidth nt much exporting frequency values rebuilding waveform elsewhere  another idea would go reverse direction  take tdmayaunity scene  render tiltbrush

np   i think really great something similar 
beta update next week think
think glowsticks  crazy visuals  characters  etc 
set listen mic playback settings windows mic  little check box
udskillsaw  drew skillman  also one work music brushes 
s something re definitely interested  major challenge trying figure good way create interface anyone pick use  s easy prototype something explain single artist standing next us nt scale well thousands people  another concern tilt brush 3d experience something like might make feel much like 2d drawing app  s definitely something re interested continue work 
man  vertical would way difficult implement 
would possible two modes  like  normal mode   advanced mode 
layers layer  landscape  layer  actors  layer  forest  would open another dimension  time  one could make stopmotion movies much much easier  tl  dr  want 4d
 removed 
d love kind feature snaps angles making accurate models  say  city manmade objects  little bit help make straight lines  something would lock onto 2d plane completely  eg  pick 135º  drawing circle  sphere  would make octagon 
could drop ladder graphic interact like real ladder  one hand move around  another climb updown 
use standard teleport function set location using trigger opposite controller set height 
yeah  please nt develop lowest common denominator  s fine make amenities base entire thing around  well  point might well make psvr exclusive 
newest version windows added audio playback device quick select  xpost rpcmasterrace 
""
hey  really helpful  vr  thanks telling 
nt know everyone else  steamvr still fails switch right audio device sometimes  s slightly easier switch 
s   good thing let others know though 
ooh  ve using audioswitch long time loved  glad see microsoft caught 
thank jesus    
nt understand ca nt simultaneous output   audio devices windows box  s trivial feature compared overall complexity operating system   also  audio settings windows weird general  s like 4 different menus always mix  
windows needs way actually combine device output like linux  software outputs virtual sound device duplicates sound output 3 different sound cards different rooms house independent volumes 
woah  microsoft actually add useful feature  fuck  jump timelines  ww2 
wow amazing find  nt even notice yet  thanks 
s nice keep using third party app click shows thousand options
assume click volume icon  correct  seeing yet  update adds 
really really really really wish could output audio tv headphones time  people watching couch hear 
windows 10 
hey  save 7 seconds 
thing available windows 7 tiny program  nt know works older versions   nt remember got  ve autostart forever cause s neat   mediafire download   http  wwwmediafirecomfilex1xh4jektj4p5d7switcherexe   screenshot  s purple speaker icon   http  puushrlxvgb2a6441846png  also file clean  still nt trust strangers internet exes  feel free virus scan 
holy shit  nt notice  makes life way easier 
literally set macros change input  son bitch
oh god  literally searching 3rd party app today  s much better though
thank fucking god
would rather use shortcut hotkey keyboard  ve using nircmd years allows create batch files run automatically switch auto playback device  http  wwwnirsoftnetutilsnircmdhtml want put batch file  c  windowsnircmdexe setdefaultsounddevice  g930headphones  download nircmdexe  put windows directory  create batch file  replace g930headphones exactly name playback device want switch  3 setup logitech g keys 
wow  nt get tribal bullshit  interesting see functionality osx bit coming windows  pro tip  switch input output osx alt clicking speaker system toolbar   super convenient vive decides jerk audio switching  thanks tip 
remember re like  ton audio devices nt use  open playback window see devices  right click disable nt use  make sure  show disabled devices  unticked  stop appearing quick select menu 
feature giving absolute hell  use bluetooth headset meetings  switch go laptop speakers day day   work since came along  m things like turn bluetooth  turn  redetect  open volume mixers  select speakers reselect headset  feature f   ked
really helpful  since amd drivers seems reset audiodevice pick dp sound every time update 
reason people nt seem using steamvr audio mirroring feature  s setitupandforgetaboutit level convenient  working perfectly many different pcs 
alone reason enough update 
yep  use time  handy quickly turning speakers volume m using headset plugged hmd   
thanks telling  nt even notice  change audio devices time 
s pain arse  want audio come 25mm stereo plug headphones optical cable surround sound  like 8 different options choose within drop list  absolute rubbish  list output channels able tick ones want output go 
idea new feature  started using two days ago thinking something nt discovered 
windows 10 update automatically add feature  need something special 
way mirror audio times  would nice
matters since makes obvious  could always switch playback devices right clicking sound icon selecting playback devices  prior windows 8  known sound  window  need third party app switch things 
also made pc unusable s 
steps switch audio quickly windows 10  windows 7 right click  playback  click device click default 
settings change audio output open exit steamvr 
tried set usb audio instead hdmi audio  also issue beginning  use usb audio  never changed wrong device  start exit steamvr  audio mirror speakers works always 
idea pointed 
audioswitch still seems better change source single right click  m going stick think 
 ll give microsoft try removing audioswitch 
 microsoft one seems missing option switch recording devices though 
 voicemeeter banana   http  vbaudiopagespersoorangefrvoicemeeterbananahtm 
mean like windows xp  gone days multiple inputs outputs 
think virtual audio cable 
 worries

yes hit volume click little arrow top right

anniversary update  one puts apps list default view start menu  might rolled yet 
open start menu type  winver  press enter  version update 1607 says 1511 re updated yet  says 1507 issues updates  noone nt disabled updates version  computer wo nt update could  try options   http  wwwwindowscentralcomhowgetwindows10anniversaryupdate  
ca nt  steam vr settings 
believe 
haha idk re sarcastic  get annoyed mundane tasks slightly complicated need  little trick great 
mine takes minute open playback window
counted 3 
somehow dont work  allways manually choose main speakers windows ie  htc vive monitor mirroring works  go back standard monitor reverse  running win10 
shortcut desktop map key combination open 
click sound icon  multiple audio devices  see arrow click volume bar used change sources 
set options correctly steamvr forgets sometimes  options get reset edit  probably unplug headset use  windows forgets device  nt unplug though  stays green light stays warm days  nt like 
resets every time unplug headset  least  never seems autoset playback device 
settings seem randomly reset  maybe vive gets unplugged  idk  change sometimes  s also helpful tip general 
 windows hdmi audio device enumeration broken  use usb 
awesome  ll try 
yup usual microsoft caught way late botched implementation 
think  tried use complicated  also  software like sex  s better s free  
   ve seen quite peculiar person running president  exactly sure country stands whole nazi thing 
yes  mirror audio  nt remember exactly get 
beleive use headphone jack hmd mirror audio elsewhere  use wireless headphones directly plugged pc  issue entirely windows thing  vr 
m switching headphones  tv speakers times day  games vr crash alt tab really annoying job 
 deleted 
posted complaint one else claimed issue  m glad m alone  sure settings nt stick seems like obvious bug fix 
problem  sometimes works sometimes forgets 
actually  ve got reversed  leaving plugged reboot causes windows reassign windows audio devices break audio settings steamvr  completely stopped problem started making sure never leave vive plugged reboot 
 heat processing boardssensors headset  pulling around 4w idle   upside  prevents fogging headset cold   iv put vive  lighthouses usb extension power remote controlled power switches  way easily turn everything onoff  without needing somewhat sketchy bluetooth sleep mode stations 
mine stays exit steamvr  mildly warm  green light  someone posted green light actually meant offstandby  red  would assume mean standby  would mean   problem    base stations behave btw   everyone else  seem get complain issues regularly  answers concern level heat hmd  led colors 
yeah  unplugging means device disappears  ll confuse
oh come  sure s pretty damn shady done  borderline  criminal things  s hitler 
drop top left steamvr  settings  audio 
steam vr let s mirror audio devices blocker
yea even better  could send command get pc  m wondering using third party tool fiddling registry since windows nt allow switch default 
 everything set correctly steam vr constantly reset default main speakers fails switch 
problem  also audio devices sometimes nt show list anymore 
problem 
problem well
audio settings pretty    sometimes  example  razor synapse computer also used control audio output  unplug headset restart computer vive need reconnected detected properly  go razor synpase set correct audio output everything switches properly  otherwise multiple failure points could happen   works perfectly nt reboot disconnect anything 
similar issue  except sometimes start computer defaults audio hmd instead tv even though set right shutting  run audio hdmi tv main monitor hdmi headset 
setting literally never worked  change every time
odd  green light headset appears steamvr launched  otherwise  leave steamvr  launched  led red  somewhat thing lighthouses  green active blue sync 
 deleted 
use nircmdc program called display changer 2 script different sound monitor configs 4k gaming tv vr spectating work
audioshield devs  m either genius oblivious 
spent majority time audioshield today let s say m going refrain writing 3 page essay amazing  anyway  trying explain virtual  simplified guitar hero realized game defined simple  instead orange blue  pressed trigger  say  blue shield would turn green orange redno buttons pressed game would complexi idea thought think could bring game waves new challenges   edit  grips triggers 
m opposite side actually  wish single color mode use whichever hand want turn weird moves 
single dev far know dont expect updates ever  already made audiosurf got never really updated much content  people wait audiosurf 2 get content  took almost 2 months patch crashes  game still awesome love hope modding community  dev 
audioshield subject brought  musician  say lot stuff nt make sense musical way  may audio detection though  sometimes turns player one guys dance completely outside rhythm   nt really musician understand anyway 
m already struggling keep two colors straight brain  want add    harderer mod adds plenty extra challenge 
triggers used  still good idea though 
like idea  thumbs visibility 
yep would make game much interesting believe
please work music engine first  half orbnotes nothing music  least allow custom song maps  like stepmania  one favorite games  trigger idea would awesome  op 
need go artistic expression  game gets much difficult re hitting 95 artistic  s also much workout 
played fast paced songs hardest  requires full attention  start thinking anything game  start screwing  s  complex   s still difficult intense 
thing really want moddable backgrounds  idea still good 
nah nt genius  idea 
damn  great idea  want bad 
actually d want color yellow way mix blue shieldyellow green yellow  red orange
yesss m new level challenge  game already awesome ve keeping us updated  def see getting awesomer 
see reason pull triggers dancing  understand people want difficulty nt care reasoning   seperate modedifficulty wo nt intrude current modedifficulty enjoy  remove trigger purple  add two trigger alt colors  force purple close together remotes color blind  make color blind color schemes also work different shapes match different colors assist color blind people  blue squares  orange circles  purple stars
let search thread last month idea 
would love see  even hardest difficulty game easy 
evil
audioshield losing s appeal  op right  add game mechanics even content  environments  special effects  would lengthen interest  playing 1 2 songs calling quits  well worth purchases though  understand small dev teams releasing niche market much 
thought  actually  able toggle different colors  think would problem people color blind  would difficult distinguish differences  yellow would probably okay  significantly lighter  perhaps could difficulty hit orbs  could move wave patterns blink pulse rhythm 
use trigger controller activate purple shield  rather hold close together  also like activate purple shield distance use triggers   
color blinds hate 
 s already difficult enough colorblind  please nt make harder 
fact colours wrong sides head  red normally left  red port left  bluegreen right 
could definitely see well
d like see intensity setting affects number orbs  difficulty increases amount crazy patterns orbs middle line  sometimes want crazy hits without worrying shield constantly  perhaps mono would fill need
kinda like mono audiosurf 
ubchan31 uillusivemocha ucevius ucusscuss uymindustries uhodgefruit guys  check  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4mxjdkaudioshieldmodusingeithershieldsforboth
re right  combinations player solve different ways would awesome  people would develop individual playing styles  maybe head could used 
actually attempted using lua  nt successful  messed like 30 minutes  seemed like logic actually stored binary lua  could make everything one color  d work one controller  
case others  nt keeping current events  two recent updates audioshield  one may 21st fix startup crash others  reported one may 27th  2 days ago  added  song day history  
talking  released new update  http  steamcommunitycomgames412740announcementsdetail805395467344639339
 removed 
ah  unaware  thanks info
sucks hear  really hoping basic features added ie  song history etc
m glad finally updated
m  hobbyist  drummer  worst part well  fortunately m also engineer understand fundamental challenge audio analysis  s really easy thing  feature extraction audio something usually needs tuned finely genre music instruments played  assume snare always sound like 808 snare  detecting becomes much  much easier  ve got ta able accommodate claps  music without drums  music unique instruments  etc etc  ca nt easily deconstruct music algorithmically  true solution complex mixture machine learning traditional dsp  would present large challenge even best suited companies audio processing teams  d really like see team like smule serious audio chops take stab game like 
may hardcore musician  unless count innate beatboxing  nt sense anything wrong orb timing  average consumer wo nt definitely see coming 
 nt make sense musical way  main issues game also  certain sections make sense musically  others computer generated rigidness  flow well 
yes  thing bugs audioshield  would love option manual steppings well autogenerated ones  issue holds back games series great rhythm games  great concepts  execution soso due lack manually created steppings 
exact reason got refund game  fun  s inconsistent  balls nt follow music s rhythm  s offputting 
please post discussions page steam  tried saying got shouted  know m one gets bugged  looking discussions  dev probably  looks anything   would think 
challenge makes fun  ll take get
nt know gaming experience harder really normal difficulty  nt able jump song get 99  hardest difficulty first try  nt even play rhythm games 
s three colors already
expert eraser player routinely ironmode 300 congestion songs audiosurf  audioshield looks way easy fun  audiosurf pushes hard get adrenaline rushes love  s like best twitchstrategy game ever  although never actually gotten chance try vr yet actually move arms may make look easier  used audiosurf song library would probably get hard  seriously doubt could move body fast enough  could people would probably think seizure 
used 
grips also give people shield
music engine outstanding  nothing better blasting along beat  x gon give ya  like badass  allowing customization never hurt well   btw u havent tried song suggested favor asap 
m kind confused need get 80 artistic  think d punch hard like crazy lunitic  purpose maintaining super cool composure  m sure bring 
yes fun  progressed harder half day im assuming itll start get pretty easy
yes please  moddable backgrounds would great 
uh
haha good point giving examples
yes make good additions  merely tossing idea
try new secret get utterly annihilated vr 3 short hours 
say instead asking options  would nt mandatory new colors  additional game mode  could also different color blind modes  actually  able choose colors  re variable  heck  could add dozens game modes based rythm detection engine  single color mode moreorbs  mode guns  mod swords  m sure come lot fun ideas 
game made primarily see color  get point  maybe could color blind mode instead colors numbers use number shield get number beat something
wanted keep warm cool colors apart  anyways example
yup  biggest wish well  able control much appear opposite natural sides 
yes  thanks sharing man  ll check get home let guys know  anyone try yet 
  fixed bug could cause orb collisions stop working  bug also put skin error text desktop window  oooo  happened night thought playing really poorly  p
still history taking forever update something first patch fixed crashes took 2 months  like doesnt patch takes ages  better expect anything suprised content updates expect new content wait forever
get impression dev works full time  game dev side project 
check  song day history  update  news  section audioshield steam 
yeah update like 2 weeks work max  like days   devs could released way faster 4 months  whole game probably didnt take 4 months make
 true solution complex mixture machine learning traditional dsp  would present large challenge even best suited companies audio processing teams  custom maps  song song basis  would easy fix  worked well stepmania years 
think human approach people use software transcribe audioshield score would best approach  could start exporting metadata  warp markers cues  daws support sort thing 
found flac files seem match music better  maybe dynamic range 
re sort overcomplicating problem  fft audio determined bpm  s quantum leap identify frequency spikes beat intervals related multiplesfractions beat intervals  fill gaps balanced distribution projectile launches  higher skill levels  high brow deconstruction music really needed  questions whether snare 808  909 classic 14  maple snare nt really  s midrange frequency spike falling beat interval  advanced deconstruction analytic genre detection probably overegging pudding unless wanted something clever beatless music  even would look like terms coloured balls  many   nobody would able distinguish simple algorithm anything advanced imo 
give genre option music opened  add one hassle though
would fantastic  also maybe users could createedit levels specific songs  handmade fashion  would alternative detection thing 
machine learning  dsp correct solution  problem people skill sets working native instruments  apple  ableton  etc 
something neural network could solve 
depends lot song play  works way better others 
m pretty average consumer particular musical ability  definitely see  exact issue audiosurf  wanted like game  got frustrated quickly  perspective  sections worked well  others  places d expect game pick something obvious  seemed ignore  places d expect nothing groups obstacles nt seem relate anything particular  felt entirely random times  since track ostensibly based song  hear process way  conflict frustrating track features based nothing unknown internal algorithms  liken trying listen band student play along favorite song ve instrument month less much practice  versus listening someone reasonable musical ability jam fool around nothing particular aware  watching first audioshield video  yogscast sjin s   already see ll problem well  parts songs work   looks like d fun   games really need user editor  addition existing audio processing system  imo  tweak results  example   sjin s play diggy  diggy hole   https  youtuben95athigmns  t333   imo song worked  best  played   get long stream orbs discernible reason  starting third orb song  nt based rapid drum beats seems  otherwise d repeat  drum beat occurs least three times first orb sent arrives  though music still muffled point  least three times first long stream first horn blare   blares   https  youtuben95athigmns  t356   hand  would perfect places sort thing  instead  game appears tracking rhythm  would sort thing d use user editor change entirely  aside generally tightening timing 
idk knew making comment  meant harder   er   mod  made guy makes game even harder standard harder difficulty  check want challenge 
play rhythm games really often  like 100s hours osu  many many hours audiosurf 1 2   m really good audioshield  m able get brain block orange orange shield blue blue one  brain nt get s driving crazy  m also wondering patterns favor righthanded people  could also explain disability good audioshield like rhythm games outside vr 
skills translate  best world hitting 4 arrow keys keyboard  nt mean ll good playing ddr 
time purple shield
hold triggers purple shield appear shields holding  like crossing shields 
purple
put shields close trigger purple 
triggers  b sure grips 
basically full shadow boxing  handle couple games take break 
gets easier always demands full attention 
hey man  tellin like  tons people ideas  devs probably plenty em nt implement order get released launch 
s reason colorcoded  make different symbols  different shapes  put numbers letters  hell  make black white  provide option  lot ways accomplish kind gameplay without relying color alone 
colorblind people still see colors  
definitely case
could  nt  maybe extra obligations past month  maybe s lazy slow  m still happy nt abandon though 
nt think implementing would anything could called easy   would ton work  would require entirely new interface within game design custom maps  would require sort custom file designed store data song  would require sort backend system store distribute custom songs  could potentially open door legal issues  whether justified  music industry notorious suing people use songs various purposes   s almost certainly aspects m thinking top head right  s simple concept  yes  custom designed levels per song could awesome   actually adding audioshield would really big project  especially one man dev team 
lose huge amount flexibility freedom though  specialized genre specific tuning would nice compromise 
flac audio nt normalized 
described almost exactly way would firstpass design system  assume exactly audioshield devs   clearly nt quite enough  advanced techniques clearly needed better match beat  strike musically important parts song  watch    https  youtubehb2iogpz9jc  tell arent serious deficiencies  especially parts song limited percussion 
likely describing exactly audioshield developers already  enough  way complications think  one  tracks brick limited days  checking peaks tricky  s easy us see visually see looking spectrograph insanely advanced visual processing centers brains  however using basic threshold checks leads poor output kind data  want quality level guitar hero  machine learning  absolutely  necessary 
well  audioshield needs sell 40 billion copies  dev buy apple use talent 
could make list songs works well audioshield
yeah thought conclusion came  really wish could try  hotdog horseshoes hand grenades may convince actually buy gen 1 headset
mind blown 
hmm  always used purple shields putting controllers close together  thanks  grips 
 deleted 
s right  grips also purple shield 
mean re aware exaggerations right
thats basically said
know  except  different types color blindness one really color blind
think ubutylparaben suggesting people make patterns songs  still able use patterns auto generated system  d adding feature  taking anything away 
nt compressed  still wo nt solve shitty studio master  obviously 
m denying current algorithm s limitations  ve played game bit disappointed  like sending paintballs right yet cool bit heard etc  however  argument bit like driving gas car breaks proclaiming see  s drive electric  s throwing baby bathwater  sure current revision algorithm far perfect nt mean ca nt refined think path would yield way better results effort machine learning people advocate  m sure latter would give good results worth  20 game 
yes describing thought  see reason ca nt refine basic model  thresholds fine s question thresholds terms rms value  time frequency  machine learning way overkill application despite fantastic advancements deep learning convolution networks made since 2012 
s thread  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4d65v6audioshieldsongrecommendations big problem everyone like music 
 x gon give ya 
s played accidentally discovered could use triggers  nt know  using triggers holding shields apart feels awesome 
never cross streams  shields okay 
space pirate trainer breaks rule well 
news  thanks 
 know  nt go  least nt meaning  m getting bit tired able play games bad developers lazy slap colorcoding things  m looking   talos principle  
yep confirm skyrim theme song 3 times  feels open open giant purple blast   things d never thought d say  thanks vr 
ah  understand  nt anything effects games like color blindness smell legally blind  however lefty vive games many left support annoying  hope future devs start support color blind people people different masses 
s really handy even harder  expert mods  sometimes need go purple different colour side split second  way line
hey  m legally blind    could nt agree devs taking disabilities account  especially s simple things life lefthanded mode colorblind mode 
yeah  comes simple stuff like devs act like asked add support vegetables  nt mean offensive best term know   annoying
almost broke 200bpm whilst playing audioshield weights 
""
carefull weights  damage joints 
nice get balls follow beat well  audioshield awful best  balls come randomly nothing music pretty much seems quite beat 
man looks crazy 
 whats point diffrent colors get credit hitting purple 
love eptic  ca nt wait try seven lions song 
god bless googly eyes  finally manage buy vive  ll definitely 
weights barely barely increase calories burn extreme damage joints extended period times  smart idea  wan na lose weight  eat less calories  wan na get fit  run lift weights safely  another psa another post someone wrecking joints 
christ stick  hardly 90  hit rates slow elite songs  make game look easy 
know joint damage symptoms start long term  damage done start manifest later life  completely fucking  stop weights wrist continue re fucking idiot  source  dads doctor  watched said  idiot  s going regret years  natural movements adding weight  stop go gym re trying lose weight get shape proper workout
hey man really awesome  s cool seeing vr fun way exercise 
score 
make game play quickly  would love make harder 
didnt like game much    go songs without missing whole lot ive beaten fire flames expert guitar hero maybe thats  harder beat game vive way make even harder 
difficulty mod using  nt played since 2x workout mod still easy 
thinking  problem sweat lot heart rate goes 
unpopular opinion  s standing far back possible blobs converge closer arms less distance travel 
twitch window pops underneath builtin feature  something like dashboard program v 
one amazing things ve seen done vr  goddamn  nt know could play fast  thank sharing  m fan  
m gon na guy ask s song 
great  try something fast  like fleshgod apocalypse  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vxjkyzwqit7s  
s already late guy  watch video  fucked joints 
ve almost 6 months  wear wrist supports  take special care push hard 
depends  light weight straps  like pounds  looks like s wearing  wo nt long term damage waving arms around frantically already anyway  help buff endurance shorter workout certainly nice  nt time patience wear speedbag rope pull normal circumstances  shorter workout  light  weights wrists wear little faster perfectly viable  s re strapping several tens pounds ankles trying things  inevitably  hurt muscles eventually normalize resistance start overextending  heavier straps  ones s wearing  damage intended used alternative dumbbells  mostly ankles free weight reps legs  gyms nt since cable stations ankle straps let exercises people less likely try something stupid instead  like weighted jumping jacks 
ve found trying harder mods leads better beat detection  easier difficulty  worse mapping 
problem  everyone seems fascinated audioshield  musician rhythmically inclined individual  ve found obnoxious best nearly unplayable worst  m queuing avant garde jazz tracks  m playing beatdriven edm translate beautifully rhythm game  missing  d seen mention mods game thing   improve game play 
purple shield hits purple notes  must hit orb corresponding colour

 pushing hard  wrist weights 200bpm pick one  problem nt much wrists elbows  way ankle weights bad knees  want extra strength throw weight vest  wrist weights good re 
helps  mine 750g  nothing crazy 
thanks informative post  s max weight d recommend wearing use vive  far play fps fantasy games rhythm games like nt know m flailing way play 
even true rock band guitar hero  super easy modes actually harder musicallyinclined people lack notes body feels like one really make feel wrong 
think s detection  easy modes game skips beats make less intense hard modes get s supposed 
interesting thanks
m  audiosheild dissapointment  rhythm nt important re happy flailing around music power ya 
 m playing beatdriven edm translate beautifully rhythm game  s issue think luck classicalless beat heavy music audioshield
try avantjazz  s hilarious  borbetomagus good bet 
yeah could m fellow musician  actually understand rhythm  seeing horribly people dance clubs s clear many quite poor rhythmic sense probably nt notice  many  including also nonmusicians sense rhythm actually unacceptable flaw  mean ffs  even crappy free windows apps get beat song spot  paidfor game ridiculously bad quite frankly   important aspect game baffles  totally overrated course true vr fashion game automatically must buy gets rave reviews exists   edit  re gettign downvoted stating simple fact midnboggling  goes amplify mentality forum seems  praise everything ever made vive  matter sh   
oh must go opposite color sheild making look like hit purple  100  song yesterday holding controllers together hitting every note 
also punch head
boxers usually hit something  think s less damaging joints punch something punch air  punch air s much easier overextend joints basically jerk around alot  s harmful 
weights attached wrists nt punch air
thanks  happy cake day 
totally get  peripheral vision nt best  sidenote  mods using  
nt posted comment
s 200 heartbeats per minute  haha 
keep hearing way denying saying wrong information whats difference putting weights limbs playing game vs normal weight liftingcurls dumbbells  using joints either way 
also depends music  songs translate beatmap better others 
nt notice rubbish haha brilliant
ahh  absolutely lower difficulties  shame  however difficulty  nope  d get away 
disagree neither us way say wrong

ahh music industry bpm beats per minute  music video seemed closer normal 120bpm dance music wondered 200bpm coming play
yes  point s considered max  words  saying re pushing hard also saying re hitting max bpm contradiction  ditch weights man  re destroying joints 
thing  using freeweights pick single form execute  precision concentration  generally dont lift weights muscle 30 minutes like games 
cheers dude
play  elite  hardest aome kind unlocked difficulty  song iv played elite notes fast video

doctor says otherwise  course person responding correct fact 
audioshield  worth wait 
""
point video struck re actually going one half weeks  looks incredibly fun ca nt wait try 
hey  creator audioshield finally released demo keys wild  top  awesome enough let stream last night first ever nondev video amazing game action  nt know  audioshield takes song turns sequence red  blue  sometimes purple orbs get launched  goal block many red blue shields  must block red red  blue blue  combine shields block massive purples  end result half dance half reflex game played arms sore  absolutely love  dev info   https  twittercomdylanfitterer  http  wwwaudiosurfcom  http  storesteampoweredcomapp412740
want like game idea  types games always seem like sync music  big since s main function games  feel weird re hitting lot blobs nt sync 
look great something see losing ages  would cool placement drops geared towards making player dance  arms  long blobs paint ve got slow sweeping motions fast little blobs quick jabs hands 
know works spotify   s planned included 
thanks  m also part huge head gang  comments comfort make feel lot better choosing vive  rift dk1  dk2 gear vr really hurt face short 
first music game ve ever wanted buy  damn looks great  also looks like gets blood pumping decent amount  going nice change pace gaming actually healthy activity thanks vive 
really one nt pleased track generator    really like concept automatically generating track song upload  still feel like manually constructed tracks lot better  often find track generator generates nt satisfying sometimes reacting beats re actually listening  would love accurate tracks  even make  osu  great example good manually created tracks    edit    nt wrong  still play probably love  feel option creating manual tracks would make lot better personally  
looks like situations unrealistic expectations able move shields though 
awesome video  thanks posting  one eagerly awaited games  noticed video hit blob wrong colour shield  goes  able confirm  example  blue blob came along blue shield behind orange one  would still register hit would count miss went wrong shield first  think could add spiral chains shake things bit  curved lines good  since seem come multiple elevations  think spiral chains would also good  zigzags would work  orientations 
looks really fun  thanks video 
hope build spotify pandora support  nt downloaded mp3 s since limewire got taken  m gon na buy even though soundcloud  looks like lot fun 
asdjf  laksjdflkasjd  looks fun o
audio video sync  nt really seem like blocking beat  rather  orbs arriving beat  least lot beats missing  set easy something 
great video  always wonder s idiot downvotes things like youtube 
noticed hold shields front hands  possible mount shields forearm like typical shield might held 
way control difficulty song  shield size size incoming paint blobs  actual frequency speed blobs come  looks interesting  wonder make shields transparent 
basically audiosurf vive  cool 
nice see something mixed video  looks good  good enough get  yay
 deleted 
man m gon na bad  left arm uncoordinated  vive actually gon na teach useful stuff 
s name first song playing 
love man  game  far 
actually looks hard crap
many songs come launch 
ca nt imagine play heavy metal certainly try 
work pandora 
looks crazy fun  ca nt wait 
look like music doesnt really match game 
games vive  m looking forward audioshield  checking steam literally everyday purchase button  
curious  nt answer  noticed weight loss muscle build happening yet  remember mentioned keeping eye 
feels like level  arena stand  lacks little vibrancy could  example  glowing beat bass song 
looks fantastic  congrats man 
beats nt seem sync  result hitting little time could nt tell  negative genuinely curious thanks 
think ll skip  honestly  nt seem like game d keep attention novelty new headset wore 
put glow sticks controllers shut lights  really  rave   http  imgurcomdtkdwwp 
play songs  stuck set library songs  also  sure general form preview videos  nt know would give opinions gameplay closed 6 minutes thinking would gameplay nothing else 
looks great  nt really like shield blocks view upcoming orbs whatever  way change third person like vid 
s shame zero rhythm  think dog rhythm video  
oh yeah   one half weeks        
saw numbers shields nt see score end song  save high score  play song twice  get sequence red blue orbs  would great could compare players 
mean link audiosurfcom  makers audiosurf  
wait uses sound track  cuz m thinking white wedding would ablast
really wish worked spotify  havent bought new songs years pay spotify premium
watching play reminds first time tried ddr  dude want see get really good game 
m really  fun   nt get one  imagine lots fun games tried  absolut ca nt imagine audioshield thing 
think game missing type translucent wall front player defines orbbeat must land spot  way player visual cue telling must hit orb s sync beat score maximum amount points  nt seem penalty hitting orb soon late 
totally agree 
problem rhythm games automatically generates track  much prefer rhythm games track made hand  like osu  guitar hero  generally feel much better  would love could make tracks audioshield  ca nt s made unity  mod  p
says ca nt  early days still 
nt look like  sadly  know soundcloud support s worth  s entirely  spotify developer s terms service   https  developerspotifycomdevelopertermsofuse    spotify content restrictions  addition foregoing  must comply following restrictions related spotify content       games trivia quizzes  unless receive spotify ’ written approval  shall use spotify platform incorporate spotify content game functionality  including trivia quizzes   m aware game managed get approval  absolutely blows  would nice big company could reach  true music api games general could gamechanger 
yeah m 6364 cm hat size xxl  xxxl  might first time s actually something positive certainly makes things like finding cheap motor cycle helmets pain ass 
looks super fun 
prefer hand made tracks engine 
think s technique issue  curtain strings notes require management foot placement wrist actions get tangled focusing next beat two  similar playing ddr reading sheet music 
elite beat agentsosu style patterns guess would work really well  let s hope dev continues improve 
hopefully case  orbs arriving random ll really putting  game functions video nt see fuss  actually seems kinda bad 
looks like s stalking   
actually looks pretty good held like  real shields   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vfdho1jbx1a  held 
second song  hold  spartan  shield variant pretty close  apart  got rope   
totally forgot include menu video  pretty big miss since really like menu made  recorded brief look  answer question  choose difficulty shield type want game starts  nt think adjust transparency smaller shields  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v2ndbiphyizy  still processing time writing 1080p might ready yet 
yep  developer everything 
s good 
managed make far life blocking beats right hand 
pegboard nerds  grabbitz  alone
songs haha play song computer 
got vive 234 226  
seemed 
agree  tis video seemed   looks lot better  http  youtubefhssdsu4yik
 play songs  stuck set library songs  oh absolutely  songs played tonight found monstercat could include video  works song    also  sure general form preview videos  nt know would give opinions gameplay closed 6 minutes thinking would gameplay nothing else  videos bit rambling end  sure make obvious beginning xd
doubt third person works vr 
 
teach looking twice  40 twoday shipping 
saves score  global  regional local leaderboards get email dethroned top score track 
  
 searches online  kinda amazing 
guitar hero  osu  rock band nt enjoyable either 
hrmm  imagine might cater   huge music  video pan room  see djembe  violin  two tin whistles  also guitar viola back lol  game right bat feeds pretty big part  p curious  yo enjoy games like guitar hero  gameplay obviously worlds apart  share common pieces 
3 different things  soooo boring couple gos  like phone game pc game  yet another tech demo vive 
green translucent wall shows hit orb looking 
true  would good could share rate songspecific blob patterns etc
sucks  yeah definitely agree music api games s easily accessible devs  ah well  soundcloud support nice least 
yes  imagine wheel   arms would dead one song 
given room scale aspect  id wager could take step back forward adjust audio sync  kinda neat think stepping forward backward could used syncing audio thats case
til
cool  lindybeige  thinking first shield shown game  like kite heater shield  far know  usually secured  2 points    http  wwwlionheartdesignscominventoryarmorshieldschristian  20cross  20m3018  20backjpg 
implying actually strap controller arm  would actually really interesting  maybe even immersive 
playing easy 
work spotify 
love used monstercat music  everyone liked   support label   https  wwwmonstercatcom   pretty awesome  also  release podcast every week   https  wwwmonstercatcompodcast   highly reccomended

 saves score  global  regional local leaderboards get email dethroned top score track  s great hear  highscore independent song playing  save highscore song 
know may integrating spotify anytime soon 
tried osu ones mentioned  difference audio shield osu actual people take time set level sync rhythm song audio shield looks beat paint blobs 3 different actions  1  hit 1 blueorange blob correct shield color 2  follow string incoming blueorange blobs slightly going one direction correct shield color 3  hit purple blobs shields  think shields   s  osu much variation movements timing  edit  grammar 
course fault  m absolute get music thing  made wonder  first thing ca nt hype 
lame attitude  game nt complex great  tetris one best games time  s rules incredibly simple  nt played audioshield  even provides hours entertainment   movies couple hours long  mean re worthless 
yeah checked video see wall beginning level  mean  seems disappear music starts  iis option make visible times lower opacity even 
strap real shield
 deleted 
 nope   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4c0nnaaudioshielditwasworththewaitd1e8cca  
73€  
 110 aud  worth though 
song difficulty mode shield type selected different score board 
osu 3 input types  click circle  click hold circle  following path  spin spinner  s comparable audio shield  complexity comes creative arranging  notes   nt see think ca nt done audio shield 
think fact s 3 dimensions requires large arm movements number 4  s simple setup 2 blob colors  requires flail arms place fast sections   suppose game could introduce button mechanics complicate things  either way  agree game never seems well synced compared audio games  still looks fun 
testervr troll  best ignore  keep feeding keep coming back
foot prints ground showing re expected stand  help 
sure 
actually foam shield  doubt could hold controller flop around 
s audiosurf works  song must played within game  d surprised audioshield different regard 
 110 usd buddy  like nz s  120 usd  ca nt even bring spend much pair headphones  went paid shipping  priorities 
wow s great  game jumped top list  post screenshot global regional scoreboards 
suspicion nt standing right spot  beginning video see look set feet supposed indicate stand  maybe stood little closer music would suited notes 
gaffa friend  friend
http  imgurcomkrfe0ul always nice beat chet song 
m thinking weight  nt best handles  s one  s like could actually use 
thanks  see playing  megalovania vs harder better faster stronger   imagine must way see popular songs others playing  artistic score  punch power    
alright  ll give shot 
yes  popular songs  songs friends played  etc  punch orbs shields measures average force

one day  correct audio device htcvive hdmi audio  next day  s htcvive4  nvidia high definition audio   switch audio device nearly every day  s getting really annoying 
especially want show family  tech oriented  play vive m work  already know settings steam vr  often seems like settings nt save  like s stated title  computer seems randomly decide correct audio device day  get stop    edit    appears best easiest way solve issue use htc vive usb audio playback device never change  still work even re using 35mm headphone jack  always misinterpreted usb audio mean use headphones plugged extra usb slot   addition  several users stated using usb audio playback device seems provide louder clearer audio  audiophiles confirm true  explain  would awesome  thanks everyone s help  hopefully helps others across internet similar issues 
yep  issue since got vive april  s extremely annoying  rename device makes difference  s one issues prevents able jump play vr  games every little issue like adds end 
family nt comfortable navigating builtin windows playback devices  may look getting  https  githubcomsirwestaudioswitch show change audio two clicks s s supposed  mine sometimes switch vive back regular speakers  vice versa  nt know root cause maybe steamvr software nt perfect yet 
half one nt revert back regular speakers  even though setup
problem beta non beta
attention  know causing problem research  must another display attached computer via displayport  correct  unfortunately  displayport feature detects whether display powered turn displayport display  ll notice actually removed device list windows  unlike displays   reboot windows displayport display attached reinstalls display audio drivers boot gives new names  hence constant reshuffling  sadly  could never fix monitor  s setting monitors disable power detection  displayport  worth look   avoid rebooting sleephibernate possible keep configuration use different display connector possible  sounds things really fucking stupid bug someone needs fix  microsoft  monitor manufacturers  displayport committee  whoever  
even turn computer  vive still stand low temperature makes always pull power computer  yes cause problem setting audio device everytime  times shows htcvive hdmi audio htcvive usb audio sometimes htcvive4  nvidia high definition  
note steamvr beta  recently many changes caused regressions saving settings
make changes display devices  like changing ports  unpluging  powering monitortv powers completely nt report  changes display devices might make windows change ids 
someone please tell set everything steamvr every time  background  settings  everything  nt beta version  persissions  know way around computers whatnot  figure one 
powering entire usb hub turn  plugging back different ports  nt like leave vive plugged powered time behaves much better  constantly get damn headset display found error  including new 212 one blames display mirror settings  uninstall usb devices reboot whenever happens seems happen whenever ve left vive unpowered days  maybe something pc going sleep mode without 
2 possible fixes  stop making windows reitemize hdmi ports  problem hdmi stereo  use steam link computer nt see hdmi ports change  or use vive usb audio device  nt change hdmi 
think might hdmi problem  ve got exact situation describe tv  one day s samsung4  next s samsungc edit  also nvidia card  1070  
fucking problem fix everytime turn computer 
mine nt even show htcvive anymore  s somehow switched speakers  usb audio device   still works fine though   
last time read suggested problem nvidia s drivers changing name devices connected  change name  steam loses track device 
ve issue  disconnecting vive pc andor b  using display port connect vive pc  either   switching using hdmi connect vive pc solved problem  long nt disconnect pc  
would try setting virtual device select devices output  use voicemeter look around google think s soso  s worth one vive audio device  nvidia one   funny thing used usb hdmi audio vive  nvidia one 
nt unplug link box nt happen 
happened around two times  disable one devices ll fine 
installed htc s softwaredrivers  maybe s causing issue somewhere  installed whatever steamvr comes  see one htcvive audio device 
yes  happened ofteni set audio  htc vive usb audio  steamvr settings make work 
use usb audio choice  hdmi  one nt switch  hdmi device keeps reinitializing loses setting  audio work 
unplugging every time finish using 
ve problem well  since recently got vive  thought simply misconfigured something  related note  people integrating bluetooth headphones setup  m already tired one extra cord getting bt dongle new cans soon 
also problem first two months owning vive  sometimes htc vive option would nt even appear audio menu within steam vr  frustrating  ended leaving one hmdi options  recall correctly   s fine ever since 
glad m one struggles  unplug headset box use  leave box plugged pc  seems like every day fiddle sound settings get sound work properly   
seem issue especially dependant usb port im plugged  
changed nvidia driver  hopefully steam work nvidia correct issue future 
problem switching vive well  receiver denonavr0  something like  one day  denonavr4 next  think s related sleep well  though nt fully pinned  s ve saying would love steamvr could use skypestyle priority list audio outputs  example mean  https  thoughtfulcodefileswordpresscom201008skypeaudioconfigpng
displayport nvidia issue well  fix works 910 times   unplug power hub vive   boot machine  reconnect power hub  listen three horns  devices detected   reconnect power vive  start steamvr vive started incorrectly point 208 andor redlight  use  reboot headset  option 
issue time time  sure s necessarily vives fault though  windows really need rework whole audio handling s ancient clunky 
solved problem making sure never reboot pc vive plugged  seems like s crap shoot device decides first installed device  liked pretend every time discovered tv first time  started get  amdsamsung4  stuff going like mentioned  unplugged everything  went device manager deleted everything showing unplugged  rebooted  plugged vive back set sound switching back wanted  since nt problems  long vive nt accidentally left plugged session pc rebooted  edit  setup one devices plugged via displayport might something   feature   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4wzum9ononedaythecorrectaudiodeviceishtcvived6bm4je   displayport mentioned uollytrolly 
unplug hardware nt using  ve problem since got vive  ve experimented unplugging hmd uses  thinking machine never disconnected devices wo nt lose settings  nt seem matter  unplugging lighthouses nt seem matter either  really annoying thing looks like s timing issue  ve actually seen correct device selfselect steamvr settings  like cyberghost pranking  totally frustrating  never remember change settings m kitted fumble get ears work right 
use make switching audio devices windows much less painful  https  githubcomsirwestaudioswitch
anyone problem  check cable lengths  dp  3 ft usb  10 ft  varies slightly 2030  hdmi  50 ft cables longer max rated lengths  mine   problem manifest weird audio playback issues  mine    problem eliminated entirely switching active cables rather passive ones 
reality microsoft imposed us appeasing mpaa overlords  looking blame anyone  start 
yeah  s means anything big enough drop vive altogether  come home end day put vive  sit relax xbox controller  find audio devices switched     really begins get skin 
nt know audio name change seems sometimes even disable listed devices ll actually work  times choose  use  steamvr  select audio  times nothing works simply restart pc  even ve turned 
problem vive also tv  sometimes s samsungc  sometimes samsung4  depends  weird  personnally use usb audio device instead vive one 
windows 10 anniversary update  switch enabled audio devices right volume control taskbar 
unplug vive s use  audioswitch always forgets vive favorite  ideas 
yeah   hunch may due order audio devices windows initializes  causing something steamvr fucky  speakers turned plugged  windows may register available  thus steamvr ca nt use settings saved  reverts back default 
nope  dp connected 
exactly issue  thing  habit shutting computer wo nt using several hours  may part cause problem  know lots people nt mind pc 247  nt think s adequate solution 
m pretty sure m using steamvr beta  personally  much prefer stable releases everything   ve issue since got vive  maybe 2 months ago    edit    also  noticed sometimes htcvive4  nvidia high definition audio  device nt even appear windows audio device list  m thinking may steamvr reverting back default setting  change audio device 
settings  device
every move pc change connections  happens much rarely issue m  plus  vive always using hdmi port card  else use dvi primary monitor  displayport plug tv living room  ve switched twice since ve vive 
checked correct permissions steam config folder files 
 deleted 
couple times  seems happen rarely  m also beta version 
moved steam library  need edit four file paths steamvrconfig file  initial setup aswith administrative privileges  regular user  errors
 nt power usb hub  link box    ve never issues like  power pc every night though 
ve never tried usb device  assumed d use using usb headphones connected extra port hmd  work headphones came vive  noticeable quality difference  fails  stop forcing windows reitemize hdmi ports 
nt usb audio device sound pretty bad compared hdmi   last time used vive usb audio usb hub though 
strange  often shut downrestart pc chance 
ve unplugged linkbox maybe twice since ve vive  issue happens every day  however  suppose could investigate short outlet s plugged  never issues m actively using though  doubt s problem 
reality pc audio  learn live  vive problem 
nt yet  see article tim sweeney epic games said microsoft s plan continue update w10 breaks steam  wonder issue microsoft s end s something valve fix  http  wwwpcgamercomtimsweeneythinksmicrosoftwillmakesteamprogressivelyworsewithwindows10patches
might something  maybe giving details setup help  50  hdmi  displayport using displayport adapter  living room onkyo 51 receiver  obviously onkyo another hdmi going tv  vive plugged via another 50  active hdmi cable feeds living room area plugs breaker box  total 5 screens plugged 980ti given time  3 monitors  1 tv vive  also windows 10 display setup configured detects television  one office monitors disabled  otherwise vive wo nt able run compositor  
ve able since least 81 maybe earlier
switch program already using another though  hate quit game switch playback devices
get exactly symptoms  s display setup 
nt matter dp hdmi  windows f  cks  ve problem 5 years microsoft simply states   working intended    monitor dvi 71 sound hdmi experience constant audio device reshuffling  multiple times day  sometimes screen even gets blank turn amp onoff  windows redetects devices  oh  course shuffles items desktop  sends programs  screen   amp  shuffles position size open programs  actually hook cheap monitor avr  ca nt get applications back onto main screen blindly  shortcuts nt work   applications crash turn amp monitor onoff sound playing  spotify  games  etc   behaviour many installations  win 7  8  10  5 gpus  nvidia amd   s vive 
tried hibernate  instead sleep  power  resumes like sleeping 
always shut computer sessions disconnect vive s power m using  got win7  case matters  set default audio device whatever want get priority  every time nt forget set correct one  recall always jumped right back vive powered back didnt bother set speakersheadset using  edit  reading ll add following notes  vive connected hdmi  got 2 monitors  1 connected displayporttohdmi  displayporttovga  1 hdmi slot 
thing hdmi audio device appearing connected happens  use displayport cable  may something  usually fixing happens  always   unplug displayport cable link box steamvr  switch direct extended mode back  bet must something wrong going link box 1080 interact 
s display audio setup  display plugged port well audio  turn computer go sleephibernation 
talking 
inside link know fix bro  think gave everything permission  may uninstall everything  steamvr installed disk f  actual steam c   think s problem  thought two separated things 
steam library installed ssd  separated  c  basically  wonder problem  installed  thought  everything f  disk  every single game  everything steamvr  oh wait  nt think actual steam installed  may try mentioning bro   edit four file paths steamvrconfig file  know good tutorial 
sends signal usb instead hdmi  still plays builtin headphone jack  personally think usb audio actually sounds better  s louder also little bit clearer  make switch problems solved 
ve always headset default usb audio device using stock headphones  nt noticed drop audio quality issues  always assumed hdmi audio vive would flaky since displayport hdmi get recognized audio outputs  even display nt  tbh  think headset transfer audio signal  regardless input source 
guess  quality sound usb probably function much usb bandwidth left usb functions done  tracking  bluetooth  mic  camera s  etc  
think sounds better  tested switching back forth bunch times  usb audio noticeably louder also felt little bit distortion hdmi audio compared usb  small though  barely noticeable  
12 times day
outlet switched chance  definitely noticed reset audio every day  unplugging headset instead link box fixed 
op  never problems audio  onboard soundcard microphone  higher quality dac output  disabling everything else leaves two devices way anything break ever  vive however shows different devices whatever reason really fucking annoying 
wow nt seen  heck  guess s valve started working linux steamos  everyone thought ridiculous seems seeing writing wall microsoft 
also using hdmi   displayport converter main screen 
nope  s new feature  http  windowsclancomchangeaudiooutputdevicewindows10taskbar  rightclick speaker icon  open playback devices window  click audio device  click  set default   maybe could volume mixer well  nt remember  still inefficient  click speaker icon  click dropdown  click audio device want output 
  work way setting new default audio device playback devices  depends program  apps switch cleanly  wo nt  new program current default output 
symptom multiple display ports  setup 2xdvid  hdmi  displayport  nonetheless  definitely something audio device reinitializing different id steamvr nt see  happen number reasons  many would nt related multiple displayport monitors 
actually  think display port key  using display port since got vive never issue  got new monitor needs display port freesync   vive hdmi reset audio settings everytime  m going look disabling hdmi audio see fixes issue 
 oh nothing   http  granitegrokcomwpcontentuploadsiseedumbpeoplejpg 
steamvrvrsettings c drive  believe got moved steam library dedicated ssd  look make sure correct filepaths 
experience  although ve read changing sample rate though hdmi display port 44khz fixes unclear sound  going try  bothered changing device names  usb audio works fine 
short  nt unplug anything  problem daily  s software related 
 onboard soundcard microphone  higher quality dac output  exactly  try hdmi experience torment  ve given hope years ago  s vive graphics card drivers  s windows  problems avr hdmi  matter amd nvidia cards  moment avr shows  xxx4  already installation months old  edit  oh  mention name avr changes second monitor s name turn  twice names  twice fun  
got  referring right click playback devices  saves click suppose
one displayport device connected alongside displays reinstall drivers muck names  change names audio devices work video cables 
basically shit posting karma thanks clearing troll
100  know talking  also hdmi cable pc tv change default devices windows time either forgot whateverthefuckidontknow happened  ended using plain analog audio cable dac amp tv  really old ab inputs   way never ever touch audio devices windows simply disable everything main micin output  s pretty sad best solution 2016 lol
also saves ton mouse movement 
exact setup  hdmi tv pc   seems like windows rolls dice every time plug unplug hdmi decide whether going set audio output correctly  would nt even mind nt set audio device correctly  long consistent 
vive audio solution  koss porta magnets  works surprisingly well  comfortable  adjustable different headsizes
""
envy pillow 
testing since yesterday works pretty well  thought might like inspiration 
hoped someone try  good work  
trying rile anyone hate say  oculus right idea inbuilt headphones 
omg  s genius  earophone cable hassle 
amazing work  attach magnets headset bands 
strong magnets  concern proximity headset  d think maybe m missing something  like idea 
good solution indeed  porta pros best small ear cans long time  might suggest though prefer larger circumaural cans  recommendation would solution found  sennheiser hd 380 pro  great solution  many reasons  first foremost  audio quality pretty much good could ever expect pair sealed cans  next  pleather surrounds cans large enough never touch ears  sound attenuation good  running washing machine 10 feet away forget even turned wearing  headband pressure moderate large range accommodate hmd   importantly  cable comes  long heavy  hot swappable replaceable  purchased 12 meter braided cable specifically vive  allowing keep cable permanently attached cable managed cables already back hmd  easy plug unplug cable back headphone one hand  anyone else suggestions  know mentioned might bit pricey   150200 including cable sales  probably find using many things good  sturdy    d love hear solutions people using 
someone say   yeah bitch  magnets    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vewvddxokbk4  great idea  love portapro s  might try  get vive next decade 
post link bought magnets metal plates 
dont really see need  would easier integrated headphones  wireless headset absolutely nonissue 
nice phones yo  got pair  good choice 
thanks sharing  love porta pro
would mine confirming distances 1  2  3 ve marked    http  imgurcomgbj85fl   m buying bits build one  
protective covering eye piece 
probably eventually 
great  hoped someone try idea  nt vive try  pressing force  sorry  native speaker  headphones high enough  like would original head band  somewhat loose ears 
going use dt 770s since extremely comfy  wish still koss portapros great set budget headphones go 
ve back head time  dont vive experiment  thanks starting discussion 
pretty nifty idea  going switch magnets velcro instead wear headset tight 
wait  magnets  way speakers headphones work using magnets push pull flexible surface vibrate air make sound  sure magnets using nt altering audio quality slowly damaging headphones 
great mod  might try using strips velcro instead magnets 
pillow seen vr action 
confirmed  vive turn head pillow
haha s pretty neat solution  nt know m remembering correctly could swear luckey first mentioned integrated audio rift said playing koss drivers 
s quite padding  must feel nice face 
ve using openbacked overear headphones demoing vr m super happy setup wearer still hear people talk outside everyone else mostly hear wearer hearing  albeit quietly   also makes audio feel like s coming around boosts immersion somewhat  downside overear cans bit pain find put hmd since re tracked vr     specifically got philips shp9500   59 sale   http  wwwebaycomitmlike381133854860    159 retail   super comfy  wear hours  re little loose nt huge head like 
mine  https  imagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesg01electronicsdetailpagescb005mju1da01miclgjpg
use included earbuds  pretty decent  small block outside sound well 
headphones would interested stepbystep guide 
missed earlier absolutely love idea  ordered amazon immediately  thanks 
vive audio solution  wear normal headphones
sure safe would head entrapped two magnets 
kudos idea execution nt headphones kinda shitty  far tell re 25 bucks
really nt see better nice pair wireless headphones  d imagine d flopping around everywhere putting headset  ve using headphones dk1 2 years m confused people even see problem  drape headphones across front neck  problem solved  people s necks really sensitive 
magnets next brain  thanks  s already somewhat proven magnets affect brain way function  powerful magnets immediate effect  doubt even smaller ones constant application hours time start interfere 
someone actually believed bs rift s embedded audio better   
even pillow tested vive 
pillow character  d like see hop around 
pillow looks comfortable 
sure  would perfer oculus headset  vive connection box longer cable  least long vive   lighthouse tracking touch controllers  touchpad like vives controllers  
thanks  shortened  would recommend  easy thought would  attach headstrap somehow s problem  wanted give cleaner look
magnets  op maybe placed one side  please tell us op 
bought ago  sure strong  definitely strong enough  read sth magnets vive ago  remember nt problem  experienced issues far
 first foremost  audio quality pretty much good could ever expect pair sealed cans  get much better closed headphones money spend   400 oppo pm3 ridiculously good 
swear read portapotty
damn  beat
need  easier said  re happy current solution save trouble  
s bluetooth introduce short delay  completely detached immersion 
1  35mm 2  18mm 3  60mm
https  vrcovercomshop
pressing force good  though strong original  even comfortable  stay re supposed stay forget easily
would possible keep headphones place taking vive onoff  fix permanently  think 
prefer tighter feel  could use elastic attached vives strap plastic surrounding headphones  m thinking around l  r indicators placed  could glue attachment side around 
come close magnets hear tiny difference  distance zero effect speakers
real 
long tin foil hat securely fastened  fine 
sound great price 
price always mean quality  headphones better lot  high end   100 headphones buy market 
nope  best small portable headphones get  50 
koss porta pro legendary sounding great keeping low price  rumors oculus using koss earphones   nt follow rumors quite 
re one best headphones price  outperform lot headphones even 250€
sound ok price  bought try intended replace sth better found sth suitable  think ll keep  much better thought
leak  lot  sound  little bass sound  ok   40 bucks get akg k 518 example  recommending personal experience   lot better  porta pro outperform  100 cans  fine price  thought community spends  800 something would recognize downsides  20 ear headphones  correct sound really important immersion  would buy earbuds personally spend  30  akg k323 xs ve used liberally 2 years  never tangled  real good sound 
hope nt plan using headphones earbuds  speakers work using magnets 
attached metal plate headstrap glued small strong magnets headphones
yes absolutely pm3 better  twice price   pretty much amount need spend get something significantly better 
way m sticking portapotty head  matter good sound quality 
take headphones hmd always annoying dk2  especially forget right order  mess tangle wires big deal many  im going see get simpler ear solution simply wiring around straps always thought good idea knew someone would  well done 
s radio wireless  research  spent almost much headset rift 
 3  3  3 thanks much 
2 really 8mm  
sit right hight  looks like might sit quite low 
stay place magnets   wanted stay removable  fixing completely might cause problems demoing vive people weird head shapes 
maybe invest tinfoil hat well  definitely cause concern subjecting brain constant magnetic exposure  s conspiracy  iron blood  iron magnetic  blood flows brain  imagine massive build iron particles concentrated magnets  get point  bad idea 
yeah  everyone younger  sounded great 
know compare superlux 681 evo  re also avery good price sort well known tip  least germany
thanks ve already ordered pair plan try  plates attached without moddingdamaging vives strap 
would lovely details captions album people nt enter thread read comments  
thought putting metal plate velcro strips using super strong thin magnets  like ones   http  wwwamazoncoukstrongcircularneodymiummagnetsfridgedpb00991ba5arefsr16  ieutf8  qid1460217390  sr86  keywordsstrongmagnets  would nt need stitches glue  would leave strap undamaged 
say  ve heard bass perfect 
yep really annoying  got better wireless headphones m finally completely happy 
solution  never take 
link headset chose please 
 spent almost much headset rift s need  3040 mod comes 
problem  3 might millimeter less due foam
sorryyyyy  1 missing  s 18mm
show peer reviewed study shows permanent magnets effect human body ll get work tin foil hat  quick google gave  answer   http  wwwthenakedscientistscomhtmlquestionsquestion2848  whether iron blood affected magnetic field  spoiler  s   good enough 
 superlux 681 evo nt know  koss probably better sound re sure comfortable unless really hate ears
used doublesided tape  wanted stitch strap held well decided stick current solution maybe fail someday
think magnets strong bad headphones 
m sure hit brown notes perfectly 
sennheisercomrs195
scratching head bit   thought might case  think  zigzag   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4e0px4viveaudiosolutionkossportaandmagnetsworksd1w6ta8  idea 
also ordered pair seen post  new shopping list   doublesided tape  magnets  metal plates  superglue  literally zero things m sourcing

plan try find two pairs strong enough magnets hopefully hold place strap placed

teamwork strangers overall mostly cool really takes game next level 
get usb extenders ready  find get good amount space available full level tracking well want able play rift  standing facing one direction absolutely enough 
bad choice going rift  ur gon na need least 4 motion sensors room scale
s going sued stealing ip end working mobile apps 
join dark side  cookies 
ur missing
option settings choose  normal   realistic 
6 7 servers full capacity times moment besides  absolutely stunned fun  three years vr use exhilarating game played date 
battledome never 200 players online every night 8 days row  missing  ve well gotten money s worth 36 hours played  
benefit 4v4 player sized lobbies able view lobbies rather matchmake guess s easy get game going  mention first real proper fps traditional cs style personally ve waiting  regarding sound fix  s annoying thing game  floating hands bugs ve fine  sound would really grate

plot twist  anton actually working  dante ai  quite  put non multi player side  dante ai  putting multi player side  plan taking vr coming together  next world 
nt think needs anyone hire  itseems killing already  pace  especially gets onward released psvr much larger potential user base  one hiring peple 
honest seriously noticed times  hit caused players jump 10 meter distances heart beat  also seems delay character model movements saying  ie   go   pause hand gestures direction   sure lag caused ping though  far game breaking would nonissue visible pings  would also assume korea better internet australia  nt hard   keep telling people grab game give go  would surprised disappointed 
live korea well  military orders assume  ve pretty laggy moments mostly trackpad movement  sometimes really bad rubberbanding effect trying sprint  everything else works pretty well though overall usually nt firefight sprinting happens nt detract game 
yup  tried first came  20 hours onward 
sounds good  played handful games last game sudden went extreme slowmo force quit game  weird  first match using sniper  
yeah real life nt vive potato resolution front eyes  yeah  muzzle flash would nice help spot people hiding house ca nt spot even shooting window  take account 1  s game  real life 2  device technical flaws  real life  nt see green dots tablet symbolize team mates white one objective neither   gives shit 
sure  ve mostly shot shotguns life  shoot 12 gauge dark  see flash light woods little  obviously  quick flash  
especially satisfying team wants work  usually wipe floor team running around shooting everything 
got usbhmdi extenders already  hope extenders included touch 
nope
know decades making lots money  innovating lots aspects gaming software design generally baddest nerd block  s terrible place  facebook money real 
even
already playtime onward vr game  truly believe could become counterstrike vr 
getting destroyed average players day one 
haha ya man  like gang war
previous job issues servers azure manager nt want pay power catch  d run several instances servers visual studio laptop pointed production  depends point code 
dabble unity never done multiplayeronline stuff  apologies n00b comment  nt occurred could interact rest players without running proper build game  d love know much stuff dev could modify within build whilst compatible rest normal players  ie change everything looks  mechanics game  gravity  much ammo u etc etc  saying dante would inclination cheatfuck game  s interesting s possible  first thing brings mind neo matrix able seerewrite code change world fly  sounds fun 
good hear nt lot problems  m teaching english 
check c   drive magically fills onward gaming  suspect little ram memory leak  running vram  fills c   certain point might make unplayable  restart game pc solved though another games   early access  problem   
 real life  nt see green dots tablet symbolize team mates white one objective neither   yes  ve near realtime portable tracking since 90s 
lol  funny agree  tweaks hardware limitations regarding improving gameplay considered without dismissed unrealistic  especially talking relative reality unreality machine

likely enough nice safe non room scale experience  long cord rift anyway 
yes sensor field view small 2 corner room apparently
also built rockets fun got judo black belt  built model fps engines  maybe smartest innovative coder ever 
completely agreed  imagine game modes come  mention maps polish 
re going make vomit

s game milsimulation  trying imitate real life combat
really hope  d mean support  roomscale degree  ve pretty nebulous sort support re giving  re 8 feet long believe  working nicely 10 foot extensions   eople get mixed results using extensions  based google searches  first party solution would grand 
well  going depend room size  cameras good enough room scale  big vive enough large roommax roomscale size  forget much supposed exactly  3 meters  know s far single camera tracks loses tracking  could farther one camera  sure  basically yeah  could nt stick corners room  still set roomscale 
v cool
curiosity  large area re wanting play 
would set cameras cuz need 360 degrees play roomscale game  including onward   really hope dante  dev  soon adds support rift touch controllers  would cool play rift peeps
25x3 meters maybe  two cameras ends working poorly contrary expectations  well  lesson learned  ¯  ツ  ¯ d rather lighthouse mount corners room done m sure setting two cameras roomscale pain  d lose rift headset buildoptics  touch  maybe vive 11 s build  third party controllers resemble touch controllers good replacement future 
guess look youtube vids people playing room scale stuff touch controllers get examples 
many people playing relatively small area stay near center playspace  hopefully claims improved tracking true bigger distances brought  absolute best thing could happen us vivers easy roomscale rift  hope works  shit amazing anyone wish impossible vr brothers 
yea hope works looks like touch games designed 180 degree front facing   roomscale key vr  hope works end rift users like p90 said  s best thing us vive users  best experience everyone
agree  get feeling lot rift users wo nt front facing setup touch room scale cool  look onward

interface amazing  really looking forward move sequencer  filter  etc  capabilities  know re onto something really great based fact people want many features 
wow  m blown away  idea road  visualizer acts like sample library  interacting background instrument localized effects  keep greeat work  truly killer app 
hey  letting know  dropped review store page  asking please nt make hold triggers drumming maracas  s redundant mechanic s probably good trigger springs  re sticky enough  click trigger  grips  grab  click release  please 
man really bad  bought though  s really neat  reminds much tiltbrush  great way   ui  offhand  d like see workshop integration  frankly m unlikely able ever make anything worth listening 
really really cool  enjoyed lot  number one wish would letting drum sticks stick hand rather hold trigger  maybe option like press grip buttons holding sticks trigger locks  place  anyway  super excited exists  thanks 
way preview sounds tapes give without putting tape player  takes long find right sample  otherwise loving 
messed around bunch last night really enjoying  s wishlistfeedback   would nice every 4th bar time signature different color better see many bars  option change based time signatures would awesome  like default 44 34 option   something like recorder would great  spent lot time counting many bars  specifically recorder  pull right length   would nice recorder snapped started time signature  nt believe  d also love option start recording hitting input  keyboard drum    would cool proximity keyboard  could use track pads change input chords  example  instead one point interaction controller  could press rotate trackpad becomes two three points spaced enough hit specific chord  could rotate around trackpad get different chords   synths pads tape deck would nice  right s pretty much noise glitch stuff beyond drums 
ujloganolson like lot things ways go  think biggest question nt velocity hit things  vr  believe experience  needs feel close real thing possible  instance  haptic feedback press key key board feels pretty decent  drums  matter hit drums always sound  takes completely immersion s would sound whatsoever  also sucks play velocity  fmod audio middleware things like slight randomization volume parameters make audio feel naturally  combination ideally ability create different sounds depending hit  also achievable using audio middleware   assuming done already capable adding kind functionality  happen questions would achieve using audio middleware  feel free dm  good luck  keep working polishing  latency needs work others mentioned  quite dealbreaker would make experience much better less latency 
background noise studio app    s really confusing
vive way sound stage steam library  looks awesome  good price  
really need trailer actually shows stuff made  nt know thought background music game s literally making music good idea 
great job  ve hopingwaiting something like come along    mods    someone set man proper flair identify dev 
hi  thank developing  tried lot fun  lot potential could probably hundred things could ask suggest s questions   possible combine two oscillators create multi oscillator synth  nt figure brief testing   going implement lfo effects  would really make sound feel alive   seems possible sequence keyboard  planning include kind sequencer piano roll sort   also sequencer  think could parameter locks  like elektron synths  could record different sequencer steps different oscillator settings example 
introduce way somehow use various vst plugins instruments ingame  love forever ever  m trying squeeze every penny komplete 10
one thing  would really great could preview samples grip button something like 
nt able find information seems like feature wanted confirm  dump audio disk  preferably something held licenses like mp3 
game super cool  played bit  one thing delay instruments really tough deal  sort ruins recording bit  also d nice could save items together pull drum speaker soundbox dealie  cool  keep cookin  
hi  looks good  instabuy m back home  songs caustic android  also free full feature windows version   sometime limited pretty entertaining  think could reach similar functionalities soundstage  plan include vst support  keep 
 old  vr mean 
pull trigger wan na know one thing  haptic feedback drum hits  please add ll buy heartbeat 
read steam forums  prefer feedback ways 
well first  could please explain  https  youtubeadmafgnhi
hey  piece software quite remarkable  wondering one might go recording sample  say  riff keyboard  hook sequencer  sequencer used trigger playback recorder  ie  could one record riff keyboard recorder  hook recorder sequencer  way record onto tape used sampler   could reasonably easy ways implement sequencing instruments like keyboard  d really neat able create samples software save samples library wav files  ve grabbed sample packs imported  really adds possibilities 
 roomscale back 20082011 tracking back 
know m bit late party  trouble finding online program would work vr controllers   specifically  leap motion  oculus touch  light would make extremely happy may plan use program part research master s thesis support   would suggestions musicmaking vr programs interchangeable regards controllers  read one steam reviews team focusing less htc vive  might change time  several months ago  thanks 
purchased  ve always wanted something like vr posted steam forums  s something weird synth  notes nt add tune  chance could get fix 
finished downloading  
record guitar play guitar soundstage vr 
midi control external tools roadmap 10  sounds like re looking professional features  could elaborate exporting stems 
 yes add samples  aaand bought  pro tip looking free sample packs   check website   http  launchpadprocom  s launchepads  likely work well enough vr drumkid 
  holy  shit    
 thanks playing 
point melodies  add many sequencer channels want connect trigger outs single note samples  since sample individually tuned  boom  melody harmony
 dev back   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4qtl5bsoundstagenowonsteamavailable7julyd4wc7yp   feature incoming 
actually m sure yet  ll check though
lol u break 
early access 
fixed  early access 
m curious  makes say game early access  needs polish 
keep  knowing s problem unless re fun 
visualizer instruments roadmap  first probably laser show 
change  make optional  something actually holding sticks  makes feel analog 
going play trigger  toggling  grip sticks maraca see folks like  s good  push next update 
thanks feedback  velocity roadmap  s deprioritized get basic level functionality  eg  3 saves mp3 import   goal get breadth functionality  go back add depth needed  drum velocity  ve looking audio middleware  none quite fits bill need  ability modify audio buffer directly efficiently optimized possible   still figuring m going   s directly programming everything unity s onaudiofilterread function  thanks feedback hopefully soundstage keeps improving  logan
s couple play videos youtube  1 mine   imagine coming  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vm9rq99z1b8g https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v4ibr2ih73ji
m musician 
thanks 
thanks  combine oscillators using mixer  update  probably make splitter also merger simpler combinations  effects roadmap  esp filter reverb   use oscillator lfo flipping switch side  low freq  m trying figure good interface keyboard sequencer  one awhile back pulled  confusing   think  parameters built sequencer frequent request  might make complex  drum machine  instrument  aforementioned effects merger higher priority  along importexport tools 
come back playing making wicked little loop yeah loads things would like pretty good fun  would love pro version one day  keyboard record output play live yeah would like able sequence keyboard something similar  also yeah lfo effects would good  reverb stuff  exciting stuff though  glimpse future music djingproduction  imagine could use vst s    anyway  good work chaps  looking forward future updates 
look 
targeting sample preview first update 
definitely want instrument groupings   delay  trying keep low possible think m running speed motion tracking framerate game  keep working 
think need research things could give good answer  mainly thinking midi  since announcing vst come alot ll reevaluate  ll check caustic weekend 
pre oculus  folks vr decades  got start 2008  guess m youngest old 
haptic pulse drum hits think could improved  hopefully make bigger next update 
ll try keep eye forums tweet  soundstagevr email logan  soundstagevrcom

absolutely downloading one  ve seen video  would nice could hear sampled sounds touching rack  instead ie  attaching sound drum hear 
sure hope  otherwise nice idea  sharing music kinda hard
well m looking steam page unable find early access markup  looking rest assured intended early access months left development 10 
polish  yeah  basic features one would expect piece software  fairness dev says cards   quite honest  vive past month  pretty much things triedbought early access  people hacked together bit software used vr stuck sale steam already adding go along  fair enough  nicely polished games  lacking content  things great content  look like crap  m going invest anything vive right  want know dev ongoing commitment improving   chances ve developing short amount time  unlike big software houses dedicate many months develop something release 
m playing making sticks maraca toggle  press trigger grab press let go  wanted playtest locally pushing build  case ended confusing   folks dig  ll include next update 
re still physically holding sticks  wands  s better wrist control stick manipulation forced constantly grip index finger 
find one  em make something neat  plug one part time show section something 
yes vst pluggins please  im one
thanks  hopefully fun future updates 
vst   import samples  create tapes  drums  well synth  
critical love  thanks listening 
would happy good midi implementation would allow us take control daw like ableton though

thanks bunch  attempt find later month progress towards touch compatibility 
default oscillator plugged  play left c key right c key tune  try play song keyboard nt sound right  freq  set like  https  enwikipediaorgwikipianokeyfrequencies
hey  found bug    nt touch hz dial good  thing tune  soon adjust hz dial  things start go tune  go lower hz  try play e e  2nd e high
yeah holy shit  expected go like  3040
gotcha  yeah doable 10 
thanks feedback  would like solve one controller problem  second  d really appreciate emailing logan  soundstagevrcom details ll best figure issue

previewing samples  using  top list regarding next update  thing higher exporting recordings work 
ca nt see way export  m assuming dev knows s necessary feature  nt done yet

cant wait jump one  particular 19 yr old son even looking forward one  hope launch goes great  think may winner winner one  piece cheap free advice  get thing polished looking soon possible  competition fast heels  also looks perfect psvr world catch attention  considered kickstarter approach get larger team together 
thats bummer  im sure devs mind  gon na wait thats implemented  thanks info though  
playtest best 
 swoon   please tell us old days  wise one 
yep  whole thesis paper academic presentation exploring compliance techniques make people role player harder  essentially use techniques salespeople con artists make folks want play enthusiastically

well want ability lower freq entire keyboard lower sounding samples  needs stay tune  m sure accomplish end  use freq table  take reference like middle c  freq according table 
headset  proxi sensor  block  apparently need 
thanks advice  ve discussed kickstarter similar funding  think wanted see next 23 weeks go use data make informed decision move forward

audioshield commercial success  would want developer improve 
audioshield amazing commercial success  wondering would like developer improve  let s hope sees post  list  1 allow communitymade tracks  2 new environments   currently two   3 new  cooler effects  bubble popping    know developer plans adding new features 
nt played someone else suggested able bookmark songs like  sounds like brainer 
d like crash fucking much  seriously  s hassle every time sometimes requires take headset since crashes way vive controller ca nt  click  interact steam interface
ve said many times  ll say hope gets implemented   disconnect gameplay music problem dating back first audiosurf  s different type game  beat hazard better connecting two bit  d love see audioshield better job well  know ca nt rock band style track muting s generating fly  however  still apply filters music feel visceral  example  bass boost re huge streak  feel beat  break streak  make sound tinny lower volume get going bit   course  optional purists want hear music  
makes think commercial success  mean obviously received huge positive reception without knowing specifics cost produce game vs number sales way know success  creator post something somewhere  vives shipped would surprised games sold enough developer consider success  although certainly would hope anything much buzz audioshield success otherwise speaks poorly vrs immediate future 
nt played  looks like colors red  blue  purple  think d cool add 2 colors activate pressing triggers  make red turn green hit trigger one  blue yellow hit trigger  added difficulty without making   crazy 
love game much  play  would  really  love see improve  main things would  1 bug fixescrashingetc  eg  loading songs soundcloud sometimes opens song browser  2 loading times levelsinstant song playbackfilling silence songs sort background  3 beatball synchronisation  detracts overall awesomeness  perfectly synchronised  game would fucking great would cry  4 able favourite songssee friends  favourites replay see re progressing  5 grouping songs genrebpmdifficultyetc  6 recommended songs  liked  tried    surely soundcloud api  7 soundcloud playlists         8 ve got bunch people  able take turns playing sort scoring system end  like tenpin bowling  karaoke games  9 better graphics screen mirror  friends see re slightly nicer way  10  3rd person screen mirroring  d look cool 
 playlists pick songs play instead back everytime  colour blind mode  top songs beat maps everytime   better ui  spotify  use spotify  illegally download songs play 
1 put weight creative score vs technical score  easy get good technical score  make multiply instead adding multiplied values 2 make beats come depending size play space minimum requirements  instead make sure everyone equal chances  reach lean quite far  sphere come far peripheral sometimes  3 improve algorithm match beats better  4 fix collision detection  sometimes punch sphere  shield passed right note  apparent near playspace bounds  5 reduce angle attack slightly constantly look 
spotify support
google music integration  
would love see environments  also  bubble popping music nt really seem connected time  lines smash bubble exact beats  s amazing  however time  feels rather disconnected  still  really game breaking game super enjoyable 
d love could get run 100  time  opted beta 720 patch whatever seems fixed  nt need  anything added  needs work  sound cloud integration amazing  also causes lot issues  ll sometimes open soundcloud steam browser behind scenes make wonder extra music coming  google play music integration would make favourite game ever 
special patterns  like line thing occasionally appears   circles  purple lines  zig zags  two patterns  m sure lots come  moment really little difference different songs  weighting songs towards certain set patterns could perceived unique characteristic  also  use checksum random seed song plays time 
1 mono color mode  orbs coloured hand definitely add game increase skill ceiling  d also like play fast difficult tracks way either hand goes  audiosurf mono d like see well  2 manual track schemes  mp3 analysis works surprisingly well many tracks  nothing beat feel carefully designed track syncs perfectly  maybe allow people load pattern file predefined orb velocities timings  3 improved orb visibility far edges fov  s currently easy miss orbs entirely due limited peripheral vision  maybe kind thin lines highlighting orbs coming sides  4 workshop support environments  maybe even custom orb styles particle effects  current style game looks great  feel exact gameplay would work great wide variety visual styles
think part developer bugfixing adding new environmentsmodes audiosurf games  however  certainly open modding steam workshop  audiosurf games well  possibilities really infinite lot early vive games  matter getting large modding community going 
 deleted 
s uncomfortable long series spheres coming high angle  d lower vertical angle spheres 15 degrees 
spotify plugin asap
spotify integration
integration spotify  apple music  etc  environments shieldbubbles skins  color changes bubbles shields better menus  important  extra mode added difficulty
spotify please
would nice could tie media streaming service  tough one  m sure big  biggest issue music machine  mini game introduce people game  showing  support alternate colours support colour blind  s truely awesome game  wish could get musci 
difficulty  s substantial pool players  dev included  capable getting full combos song right run  ways increase difficulty nt rely humanmade charts  although real answer   instance  could shrink ball shield size reward precision  though probably poor idea given resolution limits make hard tell far away existing balls begin   could add timing element scoring  sure much like idea honest  even though standard rhythm games   simply increasing notes forcing movement also great answer  must done concert music 
spotify integration  nt kept music hard drive nearly five years  thanks various streaming services recent times  included songs great  assuming re audiosurf 2 library  s big enough 
add sound effect hit blobs  seems bit empty without 
spotify support   solely  use spotify music listening 
must    colorblind support   give us ability change colors  also  unc  network drives would nice addition  others mentioning  local multiplayercompetition  nt want wife mess stats 
played game fair amount two big changes d love see  1  music service integration better  google play  amazon prime music  spotify  whatever  better  2  scoring system  currently overall score simply percentage complete x 100000 plus style points x 100  completion 999  style points 524  final score 999524 essentially  means style  movement punch  pretty much effect whatsoever final score  enjoy playing competitively  super competitive still want beat  currently thing influences completion percentage  want able miss couple extra shot win damned cool  changing would also fix issue  cheating  simply sitting floor holding shields  ve heard people  would lose enough style activity even 100  accuracy re good 
dis game gud
really dislike tempo changes affecting speed balls  makes difficult tell things coming  barring  kind visualization beat would help tempo changes 
colors balls switch shields  also harder difficulties  song timer  subtle indicators balls vision range  arenas  possibility add mods  speed invisibility 
make game difficult  like triggers change colors shields red yellow blue green  2 extra colors also hit 
would like harder  boubles  started 2 days ago  directly hardest  yet go 95  hit rate 4 songs played 
m sure already exists already  color blind mode would good thing   someone confirm   feels like nobrainer  havent seen gameplay variations color  friend color blind told audioshield  beatsblobs  redorange  blue purple one  answered   s fair  everyone knows purple blue   
want hulkhands instead shields    make happen pretty please 
d love ausioshield compatible videos  local files  youtube   would awesome see video clip background playing 
one reasons hanging buying  want songs listen realisitc beat song played time  see vids youtube game looks fine see random balls coming rythm song  looks kinda confusing expect beat song  accompanied ball  hopefully implemented custom additions
sometimes hold shields close body nt register hits  anyone else problem 
mod information make levels  shields  globes effects
different shield hand 
allow harder modes holding triggerside buttons change colors  hard mode bubbles appearing 180 degrees player crouching bubbles 
add favorite tracks folder  playlists   
really old topic  ve got vive m looking suggest audioshield  ll try avenue  much love gameplay immersion  one thing feel would make even immersive audio positional  particular big arena environment huge  towering speakers appears massive space  audio still obviously coming headphones  d rather incredible  think  option audio appear coming huge speaker stacks  m particularly worried reverberation ambience  even little proximity  positional tracking audio would make feel like much space present  audio feels claustrophobic comparison visuals  thought 
checked steamspy  6100 hover junkers sales  buy people play vive arrives   
 removed 
also get frequent crashes  often times crash startup requiring steam vr restart  less frequently crash selecting song  mine traditional crashes  take headset look pc screen indicate program stopped responding 
nt think crashing  searching songs  m pretty sure search box somehow persistent essentially  traps  controller inputs 
problem  turning back overclock gpu fixed 
exactly  people opt content asked want dev  like improve actual game mechanics  add well 
 allow community created beat patterns  current ones random boring often nt fit well song  osu  great example community created content making game good 
audio feedback input would really awesome  one thing really elevates games like beatmania  sound voltex  etc  rest genre  impact player stuff actually results changes  world  increases score underestimated 
nt played audioshield yet  vive   remember many hours audiosurf properly  note engine tends drift various tracks song  notes nt always represent baseline  imagine s intentional  would probably pretty boringrepetitive   think like amplitude 
playing highest difficulty 
yeah  adding bass fastest way ruin music 
communitycreated beatpatterns  theoretically  someone could create third party mod allows us start spotify tracks time  would mean could legally use spotify music  s good idea 
s made one single person  already 20000 owners   20 sale   400000 revenue  s vive even  properly  gotten hands  highly doubt cost exceeds  re right  ve said  success  commercial success 
nice idea  perhaps simple tweak  trigger turns shield green yellow 3 primary colours covered  combine  blue  yellow  green  blue  red  purple  yellow  red  orange six colours  makes people think combine 
like idea 
definitely colours  change hue gradually song goes  orange blue opposites colour circle  simply rotate colour circle redgreen  yellowpurple  etc  course song 
 loading times levelsinstant song playbackfilling silence songs sort background  silence levels problematic  go super active visual place silent black room 60 seconds  needs quiet backbeat keep energy going  progress bar 
excellent suggestions 
check  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4mjy9vaudioshieldtoolforcreatingyourowngamemodes  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4mxjdkaudioshieldmodusingeithershieldsforboth come soon 
 playlists pick songs play instead back everytime last night reinstalled audacity started stitching songs together  tried yet however  wondering problem song length andor file size 
check  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4mjy9vaudioshieldtoolforcreatingyourowngamemodes  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4mxjdkaudioshieldmodusingeithershieldsforboth guess options would perfectly fit colorblind people  come soon 
love angle attack  makes feel like deflecting artillery shells  much prefer ones coming 
like suggestions
saying s impossible  think big hurdle streaming services audiosurfshield works directly analyzing mp3 files  generate note chart seconds  working streaming service might require complete rewrite  focus realtime audio analysis  delay  course  see notes  
want slam progressive commercial  ca nt trip flo
believe google nt allowing access   google play music integration would good 
yes feel like could  canned moves   eg  alternating orangeblue front 8 left 8 right 8 big purple sweeping circles  fit among generated random content  would make feel like dancing  know samba de amigo s poses 
 manual track schemes  mp3 analysis works surprisingly well many tracks  nothing beat feel carefully designed track syncs perfectly  maybe allow people load pattern file predefined orb velocities timings  biggest thing  dev made simple way people create share beatmaps like osu  would easily next rock band  guitar hero type game
check  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4mjy9vaudioshieldtoolforcreatingyourowngamemodes  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4mxjdkaudioshieldmodusingeithershieldsforboth come soon 
horses courses  like move around orbs destroyed front face  like confetti explosions happening around 
would great see spotify integration  basically deleted audio files since started using spotify really want try game  though m going rebuild library  looks like possible  https  developerspotifycomtechnologieslibspotify
still think difficulty could achieved weight creative score  really easy focus blocking beats  infact keep shields body using brawler shields   difficulty ramps put effort punch  large motions improve creative score  attempt combine technical ability  got self quite bit difficulty 
made tool adjusting difficulty  check  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4mjy9vaudioshieldtoolforcreatingyourowngamemodes
wish could set shortcut music folder  mine nt default location 
actually crashes  walk desktop see  audioshield stopped responding  message
definitely crashes like ulawlcat said
plus  hard add content already plays  every song   gameplay incrementation always important
look  holodance   http  storesteampoweredcomapp422860   s still early access even though development much longer audioshield  see  posting indepth comparison   http  steamcommunitycomapp422860discussions0365163686065799021    perfectly precise beatmaps re actually using midiexport data relevant gameplay  mute specific instrument player currently plays misses note instrument track separate audiofile  also allows us arrange whole song 3dspace change levels  eg  making instrument track player currently plays little louder moving right front player   holodance use audioanalysis  song prepared game  obviously much less  content   episode 2 add level editor lets create share beatmaps fix  episode 1 provide musical theme packages addition songs come main game  addition  catch orb flying towards  mechanic  works best percussive instruments   also one use sustained notes basically follow note along spline 3dspace s playing  introduced level 4  currently available early access version game   finally  ll also one mechanic pick random notes hovering front  one introduced level 7 ll actually hear instrument play accordingly instead plenty visual cues   oh  holodance also use head catch orbs  levels  s simply many catch hands      actually working finishing multiplayer instead posting reddit 
ujhoff80 nt really talking patterns matching music  good place add upon suggestion  ve said another post  one huge drawback purely algorithmic patterns usually detection good enough patterns vary fairly decent absolute crap course song  adding option preprocess tracks somewhat simple way define certain characteristics sections building upon algorithmic generation would interesting hybrid humancharted tracks purely computergenerated  example  might flag certain sections  dramatic   interlude   would result aggressive  dramatic  different  rest song  interlude  patterns  could define different layers bpm different layers sound like melody  basic beat  whatever  could optional  could used override detected bpm sections detection fails find right beat  basically apply semantic reasoning song structure algorithm reliably  algorithm use additional input generate better patterns  approach would still less work  given right tools  authoring complete tracks like traditional rhythm game  could improve pattern quality dramatically compared pure automatic generation  drawback course would track definitions tightly coupled certain audio file  simply put every file get quality patterns

right  notes nt necessarily bass  feeling bass pounding build streak  adding pressure performing well  would improve game opinion  currently  game feels disconnected anything else  sure  notes sort match  feel separate  s quickly lost interest audiosurf  could easily see happening audioshield  bass boost mentioned nt solution  quick easy one top head would make gameplay music mesh together holisticly  opinion  course  
yes  also clarify specifically  talking gameplay affect music make feel connected  note track matched song 
well s say would course option fact agree sitting listening music  game  lack impact music makes feels like missing something 
stop trying make spotify happen  s going happen 
well minus steams 30  cut 280 000 
oh wow nt even think 20000 vives wild  also nt realize could check number people owned product steam  think safe say right  retract original complaint  awesome news 
way already sold 20k copies  majority number likely vive devs got dev package 
note 20000 owners include 10k developers vive pre got game  among others  included developerkit 
thx thx  m colorblind trouble green yellow  dark red brown   d
absolutely 
someone another thread noted starts glitching tracks longer 3032 minutes 
constantly ruining neck though 
already works soundcloud  think spotify support going happen due licensing technical difficulties 
yes 1 
s spotify terms service   also track analysed spotify lib probably wo nt give raw data  streams  would cool sort plugin system community could um  fill niche 
honestly already part game  may seem like first  nt  getting better find actively trying punch notes nt  wo nt beat high score  right shoofly bunch strong high scores perfect technical  90 artistic really hard beat  one s 100927 want improve see get 1010  agree re getting 999 100 may seem like matters much  since literally matters 110000th   hand would seem little bs someone beats score 999 100 got perfect artistic score  completely understand design decision 
syox made even harder mod made mod well  expert mod   tool nt tried yet  experience s hard make mod s really really hard also playable  right practice minspacingseconds  0 impactxscaler  18 redmax bluemin 05  max    dropping minspacingseconds 0 gives many notes possible way add difficulty increase spread angle  ends resulting bs feeling miss notes ca nt make movement nt see 
description sounds interesting  honest steam video still looks bit rough  presentation makes look rather bland  could use lot visceral feedback connecting music  everything backgrounds color choices actual visual feedback makes think  relaxed slow  rather intense getting groove  also big fan dragon  seen  played  weirder things  despite criticism  seen definitely check game evolves journey current alpha state  thanks plug  
hate rhythm games honest  know people love guitar hero  rock band  beatmania iidx dunno  guess grew ddrffrsm  s fun learning file able hear whole song figure patterns faster 
 nt get mean  game allowed custom tracks  provided modding allow spotify programme play simultaneously track possible   would  happen  would two ways  thought though  might actually possible  comfortable use  would possible custom beattracks

may 20000 specifically  know one bought already m getting vive may  ve heard seen enough game  plus enjoyment audiosurf  something know ll enjoy 
s got  http  steamspycomapp412740 owners  21667 ± 3539 notice players players total  3939 ± 1509  1818    much less 20k  owners   meaning lots people bought beforehand preparation vive delivery  p  cool

 owners  april 5th though according steamspy  copies must purchased  16000 copies purchased april 5th today  majority  copies  bought 
excellent  thank  keeping mine around 18 20 minutes  good know though 
might good point  really long sessions  played 3 songs row yesterday  thats longest  tried yet

visceral feedback meant moment looks bit weak visually acoustically  seems like miss  apart sound muted lot happens  hitting  combos  lot happening well  lacks impact rhythm games manage hit miss  audioshield  flaws shortcomings  manages part well  hit feeling awesome literal explosion particles  bad random patterns undo lot offbeat  older video good contrast  quite different current one  manages give good impression variety planned  steam page alone looked bit boring  lot interested coming

examples release dates show month  audioshield shows 43  also s already 23400 short time  one guy think could probably deem success 
ve pointed key design compromise play size affects note arc  play large space tried  shields hip  strat flatout fails  even trying go purely technical default get least 75 artistic  resolved putting timing notes curved plane front player 
explosion particles audioshield definitely works really well  aside  played one time recently  actually felt feedback fairly weak  iirc  feedback missing note  quite unlike holodance missing lot notes almost little annoying  orbs turned grey fall front  get little  boop  sound  target area turns red circle moment  s even red line taken orb grey  dieing remains falling bouncing inevitable death missed      consider adding sounds catching orbs dismissed thought would distract music  thinking  however  maybe s bad idea  exactly right sound  subtle also intense  sound much  tone   conflict music   one really nice thing nt considered  yet  gives additional layer information close rhythm  final trailer  ll definitely include little bit level 10  see first three level  game kind looks like s suitable kids  personally  think vr general  game particular also really nt 
four  next guy better say  v  e
point basically owners  number ca nt used determine sales titles  yes  sure s success  nt made  400k  looks like s top selling vive title launch  m sure re pretty happy 
feedback miss audioshield indeed quite weak  emphasizes successes failures  generally worst idea make people feel awesome   neatly ties accessibility simple gameplay support kinds music  reaching wide audience   traditional  rhythm games  traditional mean ones originated japanese arcades example  often quite complex hard  turn lot people  met lot people would play beatmania  many would try  turned difficult get  long time starting  music sounds like absolute crap  later  getting skilled  game really starts shine  definitely something try avoid  bit accessible definite plus  especially small market like vr right  would careful audio feedback happens exactly player input time beat  might annoying slightly offtiming always hear imperfections  subtle enough  might work though  knows

binaural support current games

psvr 3d binaural audio  binaural recordings hear psvr games really sound 
recent psvr gameplay videos look like recorded directly mirrored social screen  tv hdmi output processing unit   good example recent  keeper  video headmaster  thinking  processing unit encodes 3d binaural stereo audio headset  perhaps output 3d binaural stereo audio mirrored social screen well  indeed case  3d binaural effect also present recorded gameplay video  tried watching  keeper  video using headphones test theory  sounds like regular stereo audio rather 3d binaural audio  therefore seems like processing unit output two separate audio streams   3d binaural stereo audio psvr headset   regular stereo audio social screen  guess makes sense  binaural audio nt unlistenable means regular speakers  nt sound good regular stereo audio due necessary effects added produce 3d illusion using headphones  aside  processing unit also needs produce separate audio signals asynchronous local multiplayer games like playroom vr  guess s stretch binaural stereo mirrored social screen single player games  two question   first  official confirmation processing unit indeed output separate nonbinaural audio output mirrored social screen   second  anyone know binaural audio psvr recorded made publicly available yet  already know binaural audio sounds like nongaming context  would nice get real idea expect games sound like coming directly processing unit  even better binaural recording combined video footage game well 
virtual barbershop https  youtubeiudtlvagjja
nt think video available shows psvr s 3d audio idea s send hdmi  pretty useless regular tv speakers   plan capturing psvr footage  d recommend getting yadapter psvr s 35mm audio jack loop sound back sound card  replacing hdmi sound   way definitely able capture exactly whatever player sees hears 
relevant  know  digitally  people make goodhertz plugins  amongst best get  combining excellent sound processing ease use  great demos website  worth checking examples binaural audio  midside panpot relevant discussion  less relevantly  vulf compressor finest ve used  https  goodhertzco
psvr capable binaural audio  devs implement  i would nt surprised none started yet edit  agree worlds seem use 
obviously know binaural audio works terms sounds played fractions seconds apart slight diffrent volumes  think differences played ear small would nt even notice played tv stereo speaker  reason works s played directly ear 
s psvr  already know 
actually  binaural audio one main tasks processing unit  understand  s relatively simple developers use  need provide audio position  x   z coordinates  relative players head  processing unit rest work make sound 3d headphones   disclaimer  nt inside knowledge  explanation probably somewhat simpler reality  s basic principle anyway 
world s definitely 
nt think implemented   software takes care 
yes  understand basic principles binaural audio  hence tried listening headmaster video using headphones  made sure spatial audio effects disabled   understand s going work tv external speakers 
s good point  kind asked wrong question case  asked binaural recordings  psvr binaural recordings specifically  
well know binaural audio sounds like 
tried googling came empty  source  would love true 
well far know  binaural audio done mixing  psvr hardware processes headphones  think accounts worlds correct think back tried getaway  audio amazing  remember leaning head window car sound wind rushing ears realistic 
guess wo nt work external speakers would nt mater sound output tv processing box 
binaural audio equal  virtual barbershop  prerendered  binaural  know  difference virtual barbershop realtime psvr binaural could like difference ps1 prerendered backgrounds  resident evil 1  final fantasy vii  etc   ps1 realtime 3d graphics 
sorry source  tried deep getaway eb games  gamestop  hear especially getaway open door guys talking  ve also tried battle zone could nt tell sounded like video game  probably  
recall early impressions london heist talking scene gangster hands phone  move virtual phone ear listen voice  tell sound phone gets closer ear like would real world  point least one player thought sound coming move controller  move speaker   definitely sounds like binaural audio  nt recall heard though  long time ago 
https  jawbonecomliveaudio nt know much may find interesting
sounds great  psvr demo session booked early september m hoping play getaway  ve played battlezone far   ll pay attention audio get play 
played battlezone  nt pay attention audio demo  one moment  remember noticing far noises one side sounded quite convincing  however  m sure game really lends well binaural audio others 
i tried battlezone  sounded like video game   realized afterwards headphones pluged audio jack wire coming break box  gold headphones linked via bluetooth  understanding  need pluged audio jack coming breakout box order feature work  guess get full experience  really cool nonetheless  ca nt wait october 13 
hey  yeah  mention later comment remember heist sounds like binaural audio  specifically leaned car window 
re right need plugged 3d audio work  seems like rep dropped ball showing every feature  oh well

lazy  heres starts   https  youtube51za5u3ltec  t297   https  youtube51za5u3ltec  t297 
nice  thanks 
best binaural example ve heard  still gets excited possibilities  got first real audiophile headphones mail today  m even pumped vr  see really sounds like 
blew away  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vopta4hrphs
bold claims making  s interesting  s best example ve heard 
watched headset     please tell psvr utilises stereo sound like video 
rez infinite great binaural sound  watch video headphones https  wwwyoutubecomshared  ciccm6wk3hzww 4 minutes hear creature  nt taken  swim around player screen still know exactly despite behind player 
asmr 
remember one 
 try masturbating listening  s like nt mind watching youtube comments never dissapoint
close eyes get decent hair cut  https  youtubeiudtlvagjja old yet brilliant 
psvr breakout box built generate kind 3d binaural audio  yes  expect psvr games use   
yes  produces binaural audio  video showing  slightly delaying sounds differently ear simulates happens irl sound wave moves across head  gives good idea sound originates 
rasmr quite bit binaural content  asmr binaural 
binaural sound bit complex slightly delaying sounds  range frequencies also attenuated different levels  whole process approximated known hrtf  headrelated transfer function   brain analyses shifts time frequency attenuation isolate direction sound coming  pretty damn nifty brains  shame sucks math  though 
online games use 3d binaural audio voice chat 
know online multiplayer games usually pipe raw voice audio  m wondering psvr games voices players processed processing unit originate players location 3d world  guess would nt work games like rigs eve re mostly distance  say re playing sportsbarvr  would cool could walk behind friend say  hey buddy  hear voice coming behind  anyone know psvr something like  used upcoming games  think would add huge amount social sense presence 
would imagine  bunch games outside vr proximity chat  socom one first ones remember  surround sound could tell talking  hope implement social stuff add immersion  something like rigs make sounds like voice echoing cockpit speakers 
believe werewolves within use 
know devs star trek bridge crew said  tell someone speaking bridge
division something similar used ingame chat party chat  made sound like person certain direction would echo depending location  pretty cool 
korix said 3d audio voices  said sneak behind people whisper ear haha

m probably wrong theory binaural audio works vr games   microphones  digital ones games  place  microphones  ears would game  positioned way headset facing  place sounds  believe one track audio sounds recorded binaural audio since two microphones make 3d  like noise real life  one track  sounds   coming actual object making game digitally make hit ever ear closest  every slightly delay second ear  probably slightly quieter   believe s done digitally means yes  3d audio voice someone online would really 3d audio  would attach audio object  digital person game  make hit ever digital microphone  ear  closest hit second first create effect  m likely wrong makes sense  anyone knows something online explains exactly works would love read stop guessing works  haha 
microphones ear shaped shell actually  mic normal mic 
 really   source audio would come location software s job simulate audio effect based directionality  mic inside microphone would serve dampen sound unless two microphones inside ears either side plastic head  even would simulate single direction  s s left software simulate  regardless source noise 
understanding correct  way emulate works real life 
getting binaural sound 
anyone else experienced  s thing holding experience back  ve tried using astro a40s headphones come unit  instead sound surrounding  get sound coming left ear little coming right side  s change turning side side  anyone potential fix 
make sure firmly plugged headphones  thought first time getting sound left ear  gave little pressure perfect sound 
ll also using a40 s psvr  try post results put kids sleep   edit  make sure using 5 pole 4 pole cable 
 thanks  m idiot  lol
works well  although play men bit make comfortable hmd  guy right  needed use bit pressure connected  still treating thing like baby  haha
difference sound quality surround sound audio psvr breakout box vs sony gold headphones virtual surround sound support  
months ago bought sony gold wireless virtua surround sound headphones  specifically knowing getting psvr point d work hand hand   http  wwwtargetcompgoldwirelessstereoheadsetplaystation34a13727799  reftgtadvxs000000  afidgooglepladf  cpng  adgroup  lid700000001170770pgs  networkg  devicem  location9002419  gclidcltflmsvv88cfujzhgodbvqbg  gclsrcawds yes come cable could plug breakout box obviously would rather use wireless decrease wire usage 
virtual surround sound simulates five virtual speaker positions  breakout box simulates sounds coming   position 3d space  also  headphones connect breakout box directly  connect attachment psvr cable closer 
yes  huge difference  surround sound fixed binural really 3d  surrounds   3d audio psvr actually come ps4 processed breakout box matched head tracking  turn someone clapping audio turn  also binural much accurate  wireless headphones pointless vr  need 3d audio  unless want limit immersion quite lot 
use wireless headphones  even golds  psvr  official faq states  use two different audio methods  ps vr uses algorithm called binaural 3d audio  71 vss gold s use utilised wirelessy  plug golds 35mm jack psvr headset good go 
huge difference  vss simulates surround sound system around  simulates sound 2d space pretend speaker positions  3d audio psvr simulates  name implies  sound coming absolutely anywhere 3d space  theory 3d audio steam always going preferable  however  s gaming time  ve time really experience 3d audio  go ahead try wireless vss want make choice  would nt really worry extra wire  s going go alongside existing wire inline remote  s two feet  really adding clutter 
m expert m pretty certain one thing  able get full 3d audio  playstation gold headset would physically connected via wire psvr  actually bought gold headset 2 days ago  past saturday  m trying get vr ready possible 
interesting  m playing battlefield wireless gold s  turn head explosion goes sounds  sounds move around s tracking players view stay relativity pov 
icon surround sound toggled s wireless mode  believe need wired vss  reviews say otherwise either  also d foolish able toggle wireless mode  version 2  2015    model version 2 maybe re thinking version 1 
physically turn head  game using stick  games  headphones  difference analog stick headset headset tracked 3d space much larger degree movement analog stick 
correct  like re watching star wars dolby surround sound system ll hear tie fighter sounds whooshing rear speakers sail  s basically vss  s taking two speakers headset making sound like re sitting surround sound theatre  s older positionally limited form 3d audio  might matter much adding short wire  frankly nobody going care either way  get question  lot  people trying put honest answer  others nothing else  honest answer 3d audio superior process vss better capabilities  re going see want get less sake convenience  either way good luck 
got  m sure  m work also  ca nt look  sure though wired work  m optimistic wireless though 
3d audio virtual surround sound  use search  theres crapton threads explaining wired headphones necessary  wireless  51 surround system  wired 
well turn characters head  explosion going right  turn character explosion behind explosion sound like s behind  seems feedback binural 3d audio much precise virtual surround sound 71  ll interesting comparisons  hard time believing s much difference ultimately headphones two direct sound outputs  part headphone  thanks feedback info
thanks   hard time searching exact answers questions relatively long mind  nt see topic first three pages sooo
s huge difference  particularly height axis also everywhere else  surround setup way directly reproducing sound coming  3d audio  confusing face due fact speaker  s audio processing big deal  basically  51 system gets signal 6 channels  sounds biased individual channels groups channels based position sound like coming  film done sound designer  game s done real time audio engine  explosion happens ahead left  front left rear left side speakers producing noise  audio engine sound designer picks sound  picks loudly play sound individual channels  problem  imagine center circle  origin  look straight ahead  s 0 degrees circle  immediate right 90  behind 180  left 270 imagine re playing game  directly left explosion  270 degrees head  play left speakers  right  speaker nt actually located 270 degrees  s biased rear  say 220  sound supposed come immediate left coming behind little   simplified  obviously would come front left rear left  distance distance angle arbitrary unknown audio signal issue remains   problem show angle  let s say explosion happens 0 degrees directly ahead  front left front right speakers lot distance  ll sound indistinctly front due coming wide range ahead instead specific point   source coming  handle  games handle poorly nt notice moment  enter 3d audio  3d audio goes processing based understanding geometry human head audio qualities associated  high low frequency signals react based emission location forth  binaural recordings done mannequin head microphones embedded ear canals sides  get things like famous barbershop recording youtube  simulated accurately audio engine instead making bespoke recordings  individual sound modified sound ears would hitting head specific angle  words  surround sound attempts produce sound correct location space  3d audio attempts produce sound would hear came particular point space  reason works pretty obvious point  whereas speakers could located arbitrary point space  vr system always knows head  thus ears  given moment  knows stereo headphones  advantage massive  s extremely precise  simulate sound coming angle great specificity  intuitively know sound happening plane head audio cues built geometry head thus  built 3d audio processing  s natural sounding overall well  since real life thing multichannel sound  say  sound sources single points space  precisely 3d audio uses  mono sound files processed based location orientation  bit long winded hope explains sufficiently two different 3d audio much better vr 
well thank explanation  games  like battlefield  specific settings surround sound  memory serves right   sense vss headphones would well comparisons games utilize stereo function trying broadcast fake  surround sound  even vss  regardless ll able test first hand try fair write comparison  ve tried searching official word  earlier articles actually stated sony gold headphones would compatible psvr  thinking game designed ground utilize binaurial 3d sound use vss  would substantial difference  games designed around surround sound work great vss  hopefully write first hand comparisons  psvr come  also  sony uses 71 vss  ve learned lot thank 
hard time envisioning optimal way plug processing unit keep ps4 running sound system receiver using hdmi video audio 
m new world 51 surround sound system gameroom  use yamaha receiver currently run hdmi ps4 receiver tv  topic processor box supporting hdr  lot thinking setup needs look like next week  m getting hdr tv minimum next may  ll table    s best option set  ps4 hdmi processing box hdmi audio receiver hdmi tv  tv show vr headset seeing  m loss  sorry wrong place question sorry m super good stuff  someone explain best way wire setup  would great  ll probably need chat next may get new tv  wish nt need cumbersome     figured folks  looks like overcomplicated things brain ll leave case someone thing  using audio receiver pass  plug processing unit surround sound instead tv  went dumb second 
s nowhere near complicated re making  ps4 plugs processing box instead receiver  pu plugs receiver  s 
s simply like said ll get hdr tv enough ports cables plug receiver tv processing unit tv full time able remove cable processing unit put straight receiver using headset vice versa using  means need switch one cable everything else setup 
3 hdmi cables correct
nt 2 hdmi outs processing box  one tv one headset  simple one tv go audio receiver  might gotten panicky went stupid 
makes lot sense  refer back next year  thanks 
 nt 2 hdmi outs processing box  one tv one headset  yep  headset wo nt anything receiver   simple one tv go audio receiver  yep   might gotten panicky went stupid  maybe  calm  s gon na awesome  
2 hdmis one one  ps4 tv  hmd connects front via usb think  definitely hdmi though 
ps4 pu pu receiver receiver tv
went back looked diagram  think idea ll move stuff around hdr content got little freaked worried current setup  m silly  nt look complicated  issue resolved  ll leave case someone else thing 
hmd connects via hdmi   usb  pu   three  hdmi ports pu 
mistake right 
audio  headphone sound crackling 
everything setup psvr  got mine today taco bell  issue audio messed  ive tried three sets headphones  included  golds  bose  three rice krispy sounding crackling fade second  anyone else experiencing know fix  setting  really makes unplayable  edit  fixed  make sure processor usb 30
actually found hapoened  usb hub attached  processor plugged one slower ports  moved usb 30 far sounds like s working 
using power extension cable multiple electronics plugged 
keep us updated
solve  remove power cords 
 go  move processor plug
cause interference speakers  multiple synthesizers kinds audio equipment ve similar issue use lot extension cords  think suggesting  hope helps 
3d audio nonvr content  instead surround sound 
51 surround sound setup go tv  using 3d audio psvr  m wondering  switch 51 settings stereo use 3d audio everything  work like 
probably  s accurate 3d audio  z axis
well s m wondering  3d audio uses regular stereo signal makes sound like things happening around every direction  would work way 5 speakers headphones  nonvr content use 3d audio way psvr 
quiet  51 uses 5 speakers subwoofer give sound coming 5 different direction   front  right left  two corners back   speakers  case headphones  3d much easier  play audio different latencies tricking mind thinking audio coming somewhere else  sound real world hits ears slightly different intervals   nonvr content use 3d audio way psvr   yes   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  viudtlvagjja  abchannellovelyvirus   rarely

obvious difference  important  ml meant worn used publicly people nt going satisfied speakers play every sound loud everyone hear  edit  ah  tag nt show mobile  mean   expect speakers ml   
share experience us  obviously within bounds nda  d appreciate anything say glasses  
nt think direct answers  m sure s nda  investor ric fulop dropped hints small form factor wired article  mentioned nda pressed specific detail

physical button camera feed audio  recording 
10 years  us wear mixed reality glasses always cameras audio available whoever really want accsess  hackers fun  nsa spying large non us companies politics  could permanetly solved physical disconection video  audio  gps  wifi   physical button flight mode would like  social situations would also great physical button clearly shows people surroundings camera audio disconnected  think mute button iphone 4 would prefer physical disconection rather digital  know better solution  camera   situation  would like add really excited try ml someday  believe make awesome product 
really hope ml put normal camera recording pocket box  think learned google glass  one talk knows always camera pointed face  matter green red led blinking  additional  people take selfies  make selfie camera headset 
kinds ideas wo nt implemented later versions  imo  surprised magic leap ships regular camera mounted front record video  s re going far experiences promising  opens door privacy concerns would cloud launch  recording day day life moments nt part core experience  nt matter someone see whether re recording  s idea could recording creeps people magic leap gone way ensure glasses socially acceptable possible order succeed  nt think record video  maybe v2  wo nt miss first  edit  know glasses tracking cameras built expect completely hidden 
think great idea  reduces social awkwardness knowing recorded also stops big brother remotely activating camera convenient monitoring  needs similar physical hardware switch turn microphone gps 
think one jono s blog articles talked possibly cameras glasses simply used pick data environment equipped get crystal clarity video recording  could instead put camera belt computer s conspicuous re recording

 physical button would look stupid 
exactly probably  ve learned google glass  even button  nt think enough surpass issue google glass  also think ll use pocket computer main totem want discrete certain public places using appears normal phone  camera  relatively normal looking sunglasses  pocket computer used android phone totem main camera  pretty much solves 
reason google glass failed  looked like shit giant shit sticking  camera nothing 
 deleted 
 think s likely looking someone s direction wearing becomes bad social etiquette  way nt point phone camera people public  point camera want take pictures video  wear ar glasses time multiple reasons  take every time person front  useless 
even would make look  nonstupid  
yes true  good idea camera totem  possitional tracking cameras   believe use ir cameras work tis dark suroundings  get pretty desent video  got  s pretty much social codes  wear arind neck social interaction important   use subtitles talking someone know language 
physical video feed processed dedicated slam chip operates independently main cpu  video feed accessed programs running main cpu  would similar apple s secure enclave coprocessor  uses security finger print id  see https  wwwapplecombusinessdocsiossecurityguidepdf  pages 78   would nt surprising  since many engineering reasons dedicated slam chip  hololens one  call holographic processing unit  see http  arstechnicacominformationtechnology201608microsoftshedssomelightonitsmysteriousholographicprocessingunit

well  ca nt argue  dislike physical buttons   even dislike power button  know technological way remove
