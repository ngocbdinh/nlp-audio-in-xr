thought folks would like  relax beautiful beach mallorca 8k spatial audio  enjoy  
""
thx sharing  looks beautiful two questions  30 seconds equipment use 
perfect post exam week  thx 
perfect relaxation help end stressful week  thanks 
wth  gtx 970 pc ca nt handle video 
30 seconds 8k video 7gb size   shot gopro omni  
settings get 8k video gopro omni  using avp 
s different format needed  yt offers   must exist already  examples oculus store  felix paul   actually  would nt mind 180deg stereoscopic videos higher quality  andor length  rather 360deg 
yes  avp used stitch scenes  omni  use 2730fps mode 
agree 180 fine many videos  think 360 pretty important types relaxation experiences need able immerse environment completely 
felix  paul shoot camera systems involved postproduction process  masters trade  sure 
m denying  long relaxation high quality decent length  
yeah  probably seen found recently s pretty interesting  cheat  content great results  https  purplepillioblogbestencodingsettingsresolutionfor4k3603dvrvideos definitely something app though suitable content  m sure tricks 
least since monsieur méliès  cinema using kinds tricks techniques create magical illusions 
yeah  s definitely part anything utilizing computer graphics well long time  definitely appreciate things like time re really practical everyone

nt still much expensive oculus rift deals  essentially thing 
deals canada  hurts 
come fallout vr 
wish also sold das sale    
nice know htc give huge flying fuck european customers  https  wwwvivecomeu
may dumb question comes everything d need play vive like 2 controllers 2 room scale box s cords everything right 
reading htc someone absolutely would purchased today  wanted one long loot right  seeing countless horror stories dealing vive support though going wait pimax something similar  people read amazon reviews chrome extensions help make sure reviews legit  feedback matters smart buyers  fix customer service issues jump 
dang  bought vive audio strap couple days ago  missed  150 value 
hey  s good deal   usd fuck 
deal good one amazon like week ago 
yea  great deal ca nt wait next gen hmd s sure 
yep  owned d even say rift better product 
yeah  get rift roomscale buy addition sensors  60
deals europe 
realise posted twice  
see deal newegg  s greatest  get  10 store credit buy one
everything included yes
midrange  high end computer required   yes  everything included 
yep  everything except computer 
helps  ve also heard people say ve good htc customer service experiences  might people louder bad ones  nt contact yet  though  ca nt honestly say 
 comes steam bucks instead amazon bucks
depends want  personally  nt want route usb cords around room worry usb ports hubs   also wanted motion controls release time   m also interested valve s ecosystem oculus   d definitely agree rift feels like polished form factor price much better deal 
one additional sensor  s pretty rare case need 4 total sensors 
least buy  option buy ebay want warranty  fuck htc
sale end 
wonder get original strap  like mine 
thanks  pulled trigger lol
common 3 seem roculus  seen 4 sensors  guess depends room size
steam sale ends jan 4 12pm cst  specific sale may end sooner  supplies last  
yes  das comes separate box  usually 
fun  wo nt regret  fallout 4 vr nt perfect  s still absolute blast 
rift comes two sensors box know  need purchase one additional one 
sure  think get 20ft x 20ft 4 sensors needed  room 10ft x 10ft three sensors great  two actually worked fine except extreme positions  m perfectionist got third sensor 
 rift comes two sensors box know yes know  know add maximum 4 sensors 
oculus website  3 sensor setup   https  cdnuploadvrcomwpcontentuploads201611oculus3sensorjpg   doubt 4 sensor setup would cover 20ft x 20ft  double 3 sensor setup cover  oculus say much 4 sensor setup  guess s eliminate dead spots one corner sensor 
people nt consider 4th necessary  people would agree three well placed sensors plenty s hard bill 4th one required 
say previous comment thread  common 3 seem roculus  seen 4 sensors  guess depends room size 
bad  guess re page made seem like really pushing four  tech wise d seem three sensors would ideally placed equilateral triangle formation around play area oculus say need two far parts desk one behind  four senors would logical able placed four corners play area would mean could make far note efficient use small large spaces  additional cost 4th sensor 
giving facts  depends room size

wonder much already figured aureal late 90s  sorry  m still bitter mess 
funny  one 1990 s amazing  https  enwikipediaorgwikiaurealvortex https  enwikipediaorgwikia3d
sadly wouldnt take much go beyond simple positional audio games  hoping path traced audio something one day  standard feature nvidia vrworks 
seems like could great listening music  sound around  instead head 
glad hear  s like body ever talks audio much 
hope developers become aware utilising audio fullest  nt understand lot vr apps still crappy audio  eg  beauty beast vr demo 
hope taking steam audio  also make free use  wpuld great  valve hopefully reason keep working audio engine make even better  anyone know upcoming games using steam audio

e3 two years ago  turtle beach showing sound panes  incredible  directed surround sound looked like small window made plexiglass  cool tech  ve always thought  since oculus head tracking anyway  would good fit vr setup 
ca nt help mention a3d  amazing time poorly supported  games  awesome sound wise  creative made stuff also poorly supported imo  effects used  m happy vr  sound becomes important  sound important  people nt realise untill heard decent sound 
thought heard thing year ago spatial audio never get experience

im pretty sure steam audio raytracing second bounce  https  valvesoftwaregithubiosteamaudio  learnmore
racket nx use  feel like positional audio game better
like call today s binaural audio  simple   even 3 years ago nt modern game 
oculus audio sdk already free  used majority major vr games  even many htc vive launch titles used oculus audio sdk 
well spacially accurate audio  go beyond stuff like raytraced audio

thank creative 
thief 20 years old soon s still high water mark game sound 
still get positional audio every desktop game outputs 51 signal creative cards like soundblaster z course older xfi s 
s bit like saying geforce 1080 tech voodoo banshee  hint truth huge oversimplification  hrtf concept  thing  modern hrtf different tech a3d 
 dead since 1990 s oculus revived  true  https  wwwredditcomroculuscomments6stc34oculustotalkbreakthroughsinspatialaudiodlg1wu3
awesome  good hear  big fan audiophile stuff back day s great see oculus giving attention deserves  really helps immersion experience  well contextual awareness 
several solutions  nobody seems used anything yet 
nt noticed spacial accuracy racket nx ultrawings another good example  sound prop coming behind quite convincing 
recent games better tech  audio development resources general usually redheaded stepchild game production 
fair though  nearly level binaural audio since 2005 basically desktop games buying creative xfi card  oculus vr games additional  differentiation missing creative s implementation post windows vista  ms killed hardware accelerated sound processing  forcing sound card manufacturers work 51 signal games output  iirc nt impressive oculus medium super hot regard begin  everything else nt sound impressive  realistic creative soundcard  example video battlefield 4  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vd120t8xoi positional sound vr games still could improved much  example less harsh volume cutoffs audio source rotating away direction  recently noticed mage s tale easter egg involving tiny creature front singing spinning around

keynote usually live streamed  remember watching live last year 
thanks nt aware  creative blacklist 
every time  nt really microsoft s fault butchering audio pipeline vista 
working   
vr  use oculus audio sdk 
course  games raytraced audio 
vr please
personally pinnacle first ghost recon game  properly setup five channel surround  could actually hear bullets ripping air around  even almost gave heart attack belly crawling good 20 minutes position  heavy machine gunner immediately right decided light someone  loud enough real thing 
creative tied aureal court years  bankrupted  creative bought aureal  buried technology  aureal long gone time vista came around 
s creatives manufacturers fault making shitting drivers caused bsods random  microsoft gave low level hardware access back windows 10  really touched yet
oculus audio sdk sexy  though seems like titles dont really use fullest extents  vr isnt games yet sadly xd

ll work regular fine 
good hrtf  2 channels need  humans 2 ears  
 creative bought aureal    buried   technology  simply true  aureal card back day positional binaural audio nt nearly good 2005 creative xfi series  cards still work post windows vista instead directly rendering sound objects 3d space grab 51 signal games output base binaural audio  loose  differentiation compared pre vista  binaural effect actually still level current vr titles  newer soundblaster z cards  example video battlefield 4  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vd120t8xoi
ok wait second  buried   tech  come one stepped essentially thing 
could optimizations algorithm making run faster feasible  
breakthrough  much way oculus made vr easy average person get first place  sometimes  quite frequently  actually  ease useimplementation breakthrough 
well  good  head tracking  need  nt really option 1990 s  
gaming pc came soundblaster z card difference mobo onboard windows bluetooth audio incredible  onboard nt even terrible switch card like cinematic zomg wtf  spend stacks money fat vrready graphics card vr headset everything ffs also get real audio card like worth  onboard audio moms gem collector farmville nonsense 
good question  guesses   nobody else wanted go creative discrete audio market  especially happened aureal   onboard audio solutions much better originally first started show 2000  caused market discrete audio shrink considerably 
nt  implemented advanced form tech creative xfi cards released 2005  https  wwwredditcomroculuscomments6stc34oculustotalkbreakthroughsinspatialaudiodlg24ki

d argue external dac amp would sound better  btw use audio card process sound  would love use rift bought oculus ear headphones route headset
creative driver support round times dreadful anecdotally recall  expensive soundblaster pretty much paperweight upgraded  vista  took years bring 64bit support 
tell nt programmer 
upgraded vista release problems using xfi extreme music pci  even running windows xp x64  said  sometime ago changed unofficial daniel something driver pack xfi could less problems  current drivers soundblaster z work btw

 story studio still dead  quill alive though 
quill back  story studio 
nope

great  folks pioneers 
use xbox one streaming tool  sucks big screen beta better anyway 
sweet  m big fan work 
yeah awesome isnt 
odd  lots software continues updated years 
version windows using 
ignorance bliss  went ahead bought tilt brush  knew  d kill
s still clear whether means complete  reversal  original decision  re simply giving quill developers additional time finish release updates  presumably  already working  d love see official word oculus situationtheir plans future 
article first said oculus going opensource quill  short  s clear oculus ever planned shutting quill update end result reversed decision  bet quill stay along 
 even animation part  like  s amazing
facebook took quill back development goro inigo team  story studio history  quill continue

goro access beta version animation features  nt know coming 
new onward patch enhances spatial audio  improves performance  adds new sounds  fixes bugs
""
yeeees  already saw great improvements last patch  ca nt wait test new one 
tested onward new patch  performance enhancements perfect  game longer jittery hmd  weird frame skips audio jitteryness  buttery smooth  constant 90fps  perfect gameplay  slow effect either  still turn asw via debug  feels way like decent vr fps  tech demo  love  spending far time onward think 
good update  plays really smoothly coupled improved tracking joy 
love game ca nt wait see evolves  though got ta say  m looking forward playing general public vr super mainstream
good job dante  keep pure  keep annoying cs kiddies away 
 deleted 
spacial audio makes  huge  difference  loving update 
game playable 45ft x 45ft room fine 2 sensors  issues games like holopoint far 
wanting buy game   since touch 3 sensor tracking issues ve brought vr title since dec 13th  
yeah finally aim keep sights perfectly still hwere want go 
long nt turn fast paced shooter like csgo fine  kids dont patience milsim type game 
compare game americas army rather call duty  s realistic 
never played counterstrike 
already spacial audio made improvements s since release 
could  would tight   make sure set front facing mode settings use primary hand dpad snap turning  game really shines roomscale  3 4 sensors  turn aim naturally 
360  sensors high enough far enough ya get away 
probably bit tight done  takes little get used using thumb stick turn  nt really handicap 
really nt think d enough space  sorry 
https  wwwredditcomroculuswikitouch360roomscale
 deleted 
going realistic realm things  sadly found wanting play less less since run speed fast  people sprint fast possible known locations small maps kill flanking within 20s  like game really want enjoy  run speed insane  specially tied physics puts people different footing run speeds  wo nt even mention short people get short end stick speed 
 deleted 
right  always wonder people bitch wait lobby minutes 
well left right panning certainly binaural  3d audio algorithms  hope implemented 
lol    thanks thanks   done yadda yadda  last patch made even worse believe   fix refuse spend money vr   
nt interested picking game  looks ok mechanically  way want play game mode obnoxious  get hit sniper never saw 1 minute spawning spend next 10 minutes twiddling thumbs waiting match end fun   ca nt think worse use time money 
hell plays cs play deathmatch  everyone plays main mode plant defuse bomb  die sit  like since 1999  nt matter added dm cs go s popular  mode still played around since beginning 
incorrect  go read release notes since beginning s release 
might able fix issue software  pexusb3s44v almost certainly fix issue hardware 
refunded  2 hours game  d spent barely time actually playing 
s six minute rounds  rarely ever spend minute two waiting respawn  enjoy playing cautiously rarely one first die  definitely gives game different feel lives nt matter jump action immediately  respawns nt give much incentive play realistically 
 deleted 
say  3d algorithm build ve ever played 
im already using inateck 4 port pci card recommended oculus  although issue bandwidth related get lag blur etc   hands smooth crisp moving get snapresetjitter facing rear sensor back  3 sensor s 8ft high right way pointing direct 2x2 meter playspace  didnt really need card anyway enough usb3 ports  two needed  using  asus gryphon z97 armor edition mb  suports 8 usb 3 ports  2 front sensor s plugged card latest fressco drivers showing greenconnected app   using active usb 2 extension lead rear sensor plugged usb 2 port mb  trying trouble shoot since 13th dec  gave waited patch says resolves issues saddley made worse adding sort height glitch well  gave packed away  
really like game  real consequence die obviously far less real dieing still much auto respawning  makes play completely different manor  reminds old times dayz mod would die might take 1015 minutes get back another server played way least likely die 
shoot moving shadows  checking map sure s friendly  nt even use super sampling still get kills across map g3 
gray  beige  know whether someone far away teammate  pull tablet  teammates marked  try keep general direction teammates quite often  pays time time 
card recommended issues  regular  sensor setups  room scale  fix rear tracking  solution connect rear sensor usb  30   via usb  30  extension cable  likely require quadchannel usb controller 
usb2 cameras shit oculus given crap including usb2 extensions  almost problems facing 20 camera  believe get onto 30 rear facing issues fully solved 
im sure youve already tried dont use fressco drivers  use basic one windows puts we fixed issues
yep  much better usual resplendent cheese  edit  autocorrected respawn lol
yeah m running game gtx 680 problems killing people across map  real trick  learning maps flow game 
forgot mention also active usb 3 extension lead  brought rule pos faulty lead form oculus   resolved nothing issue remained even 3 sensors usb 3 ports    sadley thanks tip already tried weeks ago   
yes  already tried two usb 3 ports front sensors inateck card one usb 3 rear mb spread load  tracking smooth spun 360 spot slowly  made difference case went back oculus recommends usb20 rear using leads   hope goes well though 
yeah tried also    thing using ms drivers app shows  error   red   using fressco drivers 3690a  get  connected   green   show usb 30  tracking difference found using either ms fressco drivers remained snapjitter etc   difference app showed nothing 
agreed  think noobs sometimes surprised places sprint often get kills  getting good start really helps looking anything moves  rambo  
yes  like said  actually handle 3x usb 30 sensors  system needs quadchannel usb 30 card  basically  rear sensor usb 20  nt get enough tracking information  rear sensor usb 30  overload system s capabilities 
s annoying  z97 deluxe  running 2 intel usb3  one usb2  front case  asmedia 3 ve noticed though try usb2  tracking way worse  must spent 30 hours setup far 😑
interesting sensitive stuff  mine give red warning behave normally  fresco drivers hmd disconnects randomly matter usb options 
went back usb 20 rear advised oculus anway   state nothing getting enough tracking info recommended setup 360roomscale etc im gon na leave ball court    noticed lot others saying things even vids problem faced gardian setup window also saw redoing setup patch  also usb controller another £90 top everything already spent trying resolve  wont anymore wait fix gen 2  might inside tracking need sensors   onward 2 ll get instead hehe
hmd plugged usb 20  via vive link box   never disconnect using rift  trying 3 sensors inateck using active usb30 extension connects fine   although sometimes notice games revert usb 20 speeds randomly still shows green connected  height issue new one  m currently 6 inches taller lol  last hr show connected rear usb 30 speeds  knows  
know height thing  settings  devices  configure rift  set floor position fixes jiff
yeah simple enough without going  reset tracking   full setup  still pain arse  hehe

apex taking long  kidding  sounds like make experience even better sound wise  maybe bullet really start sound like s zooming ear   right  ’ tackling sound reflections—enabling vr experiences better match environment making easier sound designers get work automatically  working reflections  also s good see oculus still share blog posts detailing importance audio vr 
oh man  getting back   windows vista seriously killed pc audio  available 10 years ago eax50 came creative xfi cards  marketing name macrofx thing  pitty demo app available anymore  least ca nt find   found old yt video esx40 cmss3d  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vtrxtsfqpo  fmt18 way worked cmss3d hrtf eax effects top d3d audio positioning game  couple games back excellent audio implementation  think battlefield 2 partner game eax50  games great sound design back days like cod2  gta3 vc  unreal tournament eax30 thief  cmr  fear  star wars bf eax40  bf2 bioshock two nice eax50 games cmss3d awesome headphones back  shortly came crashing vista removing hardware acceleration directsound 
differences steam audio sdk oculus audio sdk 
pretty cool  fyi ue4 versions already s amazing games build ue4 already  also amazing 3d space audio tech ue4 allows audio modified structure areas  large rooms automatically echo  rooms full things covered  cloth   etc 
almost mindblowing  aureal demo   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  voslbylaksm  used 1998  damn creative labs 
volumetric sound sources really impressive  really sounds   big   instead sounding like speaker right playing sound 
mention work done personalizing settings specific user  article indicates us different shape ears  body etc  needs individual hrtf function  example lot people wo nt hear properly located sound effects sample video provided article voice source positioned front listener  oculus ideas early words since 
reading headline gave halfchub  really hope ll make updated vst plugin 
 volumetric sound sources great  d wanting 
wonder affects interfearence poor sound quality multiple sources playing sounds  testing plugin unreal cool little disappointing  s doubt tech works found nt produce accurate results virtual theatre surround setup  tested taking music stems piece separated mixing  drums would one track  synths another  vocals etc  arranged around listener lot im guessing cancellation interference  sounded horrible  bunch speakers real world would sound like orchestra instrument playing along rest  hopefully s early days hrtf seems good sounds playing time close together  id love know devs working compares steams version 
totally thought whispering voice start went behind  front  beginning  personal hrtfs weird  often listening music headphones think stagevocals behind 
man s pretty impressive  hairdryer bit astounding 
oh crap  nt want little girls whispering stuff right behind  please  
laboratory experiment  nt work quiet well re getting bombarded different audio sources 
s purely software 
s software stuff far aware  article talks creating better positional audio regards sounds less 1 metre head also sounds coming greater area one single point ie waterfallstream  stereo headphone simulate positonal audio improving tech behind creating soundscape 
s sdk  devs use 
funny  view creative killed 3d audio much earlier   back 90 s aureal a3d line sound cards much impressive anything creative anyone else time  check  demo   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  voslbylaksm  example  instead improving eax similar capabilities  creative sued bought aureal patents basically buried tech years  guess eax eventually caught  could 20 years old tech without creative 
seem know lot sound video games  interesting read  work similar field 
ve wondering long d take game audio caught point vista  nt miss 49 different audio solutions competing time miss real positional audio 
yea think windows killed eax developers without realized barely affected sales since audio games afterthought 
creative xfi elite pro card say vista killed know demo mean broken glass  bf2 bullets sounding like 2 cm ear  prey game came back also eax 5 pc demo even  mades doom 3 engine
really made step backwards seems way advanced xfi  xfi s hrtf good vr games right comes object plane worse came  positional sounds  btw  still use cmss3d xfi succeeding tech newer creative soundcards  like soundblaster z  fallback works software audio long game outputs 571 signal  course loose  differentiation  unless game backed outputted signal  practice difference nt much titles  still totally worth imo play none vr titles  eax though different beast  eax 5 bf2 really sounded awesome sure encountered modern game good yet  vr otherwise 
actually vista dramatically improved audio whole  made without dedicated hardware possible  creative supported drivers better 
steam audio sdk already features including sound reflection occlusion  think oculus playing ketchup

might tweak settings stuff  part works real life speakers  radiates badicallly 180 degree radius  reverberation reflections space around also fills voids lot  ingame sources need directional  though m sure exactly means  would say makes lot sense use new features  especially volumetric part 
saw study intead using hrtf actually 2 microphones record play back headphones  2 speakers   made tests speech  essentially 2 people speaking  1 microphone recording much harder tell single person saying  2 microphones recording  much easier humans filter tune single narration  theoretically  ifwhen hrtf gets perfect actually improve sound quality multiple sources playing 
little bigger girls whispering stuff ear  though    
see two ways go 
wow  amazing  every time think m happy got rift  find something new turns m really happy got one 
appdemo right check  know  got released  maybe  still  s anything  someone let know 
yes  creative vs aureal classic historical battle   fair time eax3 came along d3d positioning well solutions quite good  important sound design well  example battlefield games always still excellent sound nt matter eax2 4 5  soundscape always phenomenal  big thing also hrtf cmss  worked great headphones  user friendly setup  know set game output 51 71  windows set configuration well creative software grab output hrtf cmss 3d stereo headphones  magic worked  something people intuitively understand  plus back big craze 51 71 headphones  eyeroll   hard explain gamers s nonsense proper hrtf  creative vendors  give better results use better headphones  
really piss  killed a3d card  annoying always thought creative labs innovative  remember getting sound blaster  mighty digital sampled sound playback blowing ad lib card away  later getting sound blaster pro 2205 khz stereo sound  half good cd quality music computer 
aureal card back days fucking impressive xfi cards creative eventually released featured around good hrtf better environmental effects  2008 highly marketed  end still failed  windows vista  average pc gamer never understood nt  crappy virtual surround like tv s built   personally doubt aureal would made much difference  honestly doubt would managed get much developer support  especially compared eax  end anyway 
supposedly  one reasons  gutted audio stack vista crap creative drivers   maybe could claim even credit killing 3d audio 
 old days  m boring things  
updown bit mushy cmss3d  comes slight difference last stages  oculus solution basically straight position headphones appropriate hrtf  cmss3d basically undoing messed bit positioning  primarily comes d3deax takes sound including updown changes final output sound like s coming updown 51 speakers  cmss3d takes signal tries wrap back headphones hrtf 
um  steam audio sdk neither near field hrtf  standard hrtf  nt get confused  volumetric sound sources 
looking looks like s part oculus plugin  s part ue4 ecosystem since 48 came 2015 sure available via general oculus sdk 
specially designed mic could estimate sound directions  split audio play back two different tracks recreate sound sources  allowing change direction come  limiting factor  assuming perfect function estimating sound direction  would actually bitrate recording

yeah  diffraction seems propagation schemes either nt nt well  sort analogous going point light hard shadows area light soft shadows  necessitates lot computational complexity andor trickery cheat  m pretty sure ifwhen see migration ray tracing  able piggyback sound propagation top relatively cheaply  assume otoy hard work thing  especially vrar direction entertainment industry going 
look api  supports diffraction 
guess ve exaggerated sound demos make easier tell s happening  perhaps 
ignoring nonanswer given addition mine  basic answer yes  positional audio accurate oculus audio sdk based applications  rebounded absorbed sound wave simulation part particularly awesome  games seems make proper use  maturity issue though developers learn incorporate sdk quality go  comparison  positional accuracy far better excellent dolby headphone standard things like astro mixamp devices use  many cases shoot enemies behind listening  however implementation subset features well using good quality recordings noticable effect users

m guessing 3d sound use techniques use realtime glibal illumination  light bouncing around scene   especially static audio sources  envy kids grandkids ll look back rasterizationbased apis laugh  play around realtime path tracing apis avoid annoying hacks developers deal practically everything 
oculus audio sdk first released couple years ago  also platform independent  way  free use steamvr psvr google daydream 2d mac games whatever  neither audio sdk opensource  though

uhm  looked every single steam audio file  single mention diffraction  s thread discussing issue  including good videos  https  steamcommunitycomapp596420discussions0133258092241652883 impulsonic valve pretty impressive  doubt team fix 
think ve exaggerated reflection  lack diffraction less noticeable 
also released well  https  facebook360fbcomspatialworkstation  s rebranded two big ears product  used project worked really well 
sure voted  barbershop video mentioned actual binaural recording using specially set microphones  hrtf binaural audio systems games simulateapproximate  quite well imho  quality reallife recording essentially ultimate goal perfection rather sort base standard   support different head ear shapes could presumably provide one advantage though

 ve done lot research  vrworks audio processing like 3d video processing  uses trigonometry calculate delays minor tone changes projects sound onto ear  great things xaxis  left right   see source audio  method damnnear perfect  problem dealing sources ca nt see  object directly front  s sound reach ears exactly time  object directly  s sound also reach ears exactly time  expected distinguish   forward  backward  5171 speakers  sound played front behind ears  wave reaches ear  bends enters ear canal  changing tone coloration sound  brains calibrated turn disparity know sound sound like versus sounds hear spatial awareness  possible headphones  unless game engine  vrworks  able accurately replicate effect ear bending sound wave canal  currently  s like two microphones basketball  need get point s like headshaped two ear binaural microphone apparatus  see mean  m sure m explaining right  point raytracing problem  s cone confusion creates problem 
100   cone confusion makes sense thats bit meant need research  yea without visual queue ambiguity  take atmos uses whole boncing sound trick   could simple 71 system know head position well  yes understand issue  roomscale game come cone confusion moving view port  racing game thats ideal  use 71 ideal setup  untill look different direction  thank explaining

htc vive virtual reality system  deluxe audio strap   100 amazon gift card  599
""
best deal vive ve ever seen  makes almost competitive  gj htc  although  still think das included new boxes free though  s 2018 christ sakes 
also vive comes fallout 4 google brush
saw post thought check see kind deal canadian might get amazon us price   1040 plus tax great white north deal  quite great deal     edit   720 current exchange rate 
best deal yet agree others das included vives  enhancement fix glaring issues base product  vive also really needs something soon controllers crap compared rift selling higher price  love vive really need improve soon set competitive price 
 599  100 gift card   right see  799
goddamn  could nt wait end week get paid 
agree
think one day sale
really makes wonder theyll still selling wands knuckles come  need make new standard  available upgrade 
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
know pimax making version knuckles controllers sell upcoming headsets  maybe htc working point switched sell extra
deal moment vive gtx 1070
new pimax 8k stretch goals include audio headstrap  prescription lenses 
""
thing screams vaporware every day   hope proven wrong 
see making headset  limited market selling  really weird starting overreach original goal providing solid 8k headset  feels like trying push 5k headset much 8k headset  somehow enough money also offer audio headstrap  new controllers  base stations top  unless rebranding existing hardware stuff needs vetted well  either really serious offering one vr system something  like wanted  200000 goal sending like 1000 hmds  kickstarter  really hope didnt take initial investment make prototypes work  hype get additional funding  go bankrupt months later money vanishes 
knows quality final product  seems little far along  little close release  many people s hands impressions considered  vaporware  
dont disagree could vaporware  released vr headset  plus demoing working prototype thing months  least isnt total unknown product coming know
scream vaporware exactly  wondering already shipped prior products apparently production lined already ship january    nt backed ve burned hardware kickstarters past  impressions deliver  maybe ve fooled  p
kickstarter  stretch goal email  many people asked us question  kickstarter  answer  kickstarter great way us test many people actually interested big fov highresolution vr prefer estimate market demand advance prepare production schedule want vr futurists like get 8k sooner want futurists able test 8k earlier  need funding roadshows need finalize modules  eg  hand motion  eye tracking  wireless transmission  insideout tracking  scent enabling module etc  prefer focus energy fulfilling kickstarter packages first  means  move launch 8k outside kickstarter kickstarter backers received rewards june  2018 
agree  expect ship questions quality support legitimate  difficult device like market rift vive still struggle sell significant quantities  company falters way support  either hardware integration issues  customer base blast  produce device need resources fully support extended period time  least 12 months   hope successful 
previous headset crap though  one office 
feature creep close delivery  seems like easy crowdfunding way cash grab  delivered three months  feel like nt time add stuff quickly 
pimax 4k assure everyone based support received far better say  htc  except piss poor comparison  top notch verify going forumpimaxcom see many users good things say  company support personell forums answer questions interact users  ca nt say htc oculus  ve heard   tell unit good quality performs well  issues beginning solved updates firmware software 
feel like s something least talked beforehand 
perhaps  surprised nt audio built start  mention plethora addons campaign video though imagine things like stretchgoals works already  really knows  ll keep eye campaign likely back end  p ve come appreciate shopping actual  uhm  shops  instead going kickstarter expensive lottery ticket 
s great hear  way comparison  ve got oneplus phone   startup  company actually benefit s parent company oppo still kind struggles dealing customer support us europe  done fairly well competing big phone manufacturers  remains niche player  really hope pimax beat odds make name benefit real competition  uphill battle space going get crowded big names enter market  way oneplus able compete market products  flagship killers   beating  equalling  bignames specs significantly undercutting price  alas  gives razorthin margins result stingy warranty terms often byzantine servicerepair procedures 
hope ¯  ツ  ¯ wo nt backing  hope one gets burned 
discussed forums  love many reddit end eating words wo nt bother research 
 pimax vaporware   newest way potentially valid opinion  sounds  smart without research use critical thinking  takes 10 seconds learn put moderately successful headset past  many people screaming 8k nt exist gpu push number pixels yet  s echoing something heard

awesome  thanks heads  looks like extra work weekend 
patched onward recently since dante valve 
repackage phonon walkthrough  hope
someone eli5  
work geforce radeon 
holy shit  valve leader vr right 
ca nt wait try comes unreal engine
ideas impact spacial audio headphones ossic x  
links mostly broken 
last  steam support binaural audio vive headphones  make big difference future   sound allready real 3d spatial vive    s  edit  always envying better psvr 3d sound  maybe nt need anymore 
want plug every vr game 
s probably comfortable use unity  took peek c api documentation uh  barely passes documentation re like dev  mean  yeah  s documented  kinda  d clue start using though  like s able  though 
looking forward one  unity s built audio engine functional eloquent way 
already try really better 3d audio unity ordinary  enviroment baking dont work
one thinks demo  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vy2vqk6pdya0  sounds way top  effect extremely exaggerated  sound source would get silent around corner  kinda like time bump mapping effects new  everything dented like hail hit looked like bathed extremely glossy paint  even parts rusty textures  really hope presentation purposes 
video tutorials available yet  m early stages learning unity specifically vr game  experience design would love put features practice  would phonon tutorial serve well enough 
ah  m implement spatial audio unity project  convenient 
  sounds interact bounce actual scene geometry   pretty sweet  demo space available 
 well  google thinks valve distributing malware    http  iimgurcompgi241opng 
 deleted 
except elite dangerous best sound ve heard game  ever 
yeah  lot trouble sound vr games  many nt seem rely good spacial audio  get around  hard time raw data particular  never tell things coming sound seems come everywhere 
find demos  unity plugin 
nt oculus already something similar released unsure free works either headset  compare 
think demos really exaggerated  nt sound realistic 
hear
yepp  actually nt tied vivesteamvr  cool starting see normal  monitor  games using better audio well 
option  baking  audio performance emitter nt move  sounds like cool idea 
 new ue4 audio engine released soon 
hi  tried little demo agree things really steep audio cuts quickly thinking  okay demo scene top  http  iimgurcomqlif4tlpng orange audio source  red spots stand audio goes completely silent  maybe reason goes completely silent audio reflect anything reach places  look pink lines example  represent audio  rays  might bounce around  see way reach  however  surrounded entire test area walls  ie placing everything big room  audio might become much better  try moment putting idea try want  would curious results 
yes  demo videos impulsonic youtube channel manual version numbers screenshots 
 deleted 
valve bought impulsonic  s yes 
sound properly modeled dramatically improve immersiveness experience  even true vr games sound modeled relative head s orientation location virtual space  brain able pick many subtle audio cues inform nature one s environment  example  real life person perceive direction sound originated within degrees  s simply  right left   brain instance use ordering time difference sound reaching one ear approximate 
basically makes much easier determine sound coming  put headphones listen  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v9lprzmogue
ca nt imagine giving exclusivity one brand 
documentation says accelerated amd trueaudio next well radeon rays  think run gpu radeon  nvidia work cpu  slower 
would nt job sound card  either onboard dedicated like soundblaster 
oculus year ago    research blindly fanboiing https  developer3oculuscomblogmeettheoculusaudiosdk https  facebook360fbcomspatialworkstation
thanks  fixed 
create context  compute device  scene  add geometry scene  add renderer  pass audio buffers  s 
markov chain 
 worst antialiasing  unfortunately 
new gorn update reaaaallly good audio 
seem like working survios regards audio sdk look homepage  http  imgurcomagpybw maybe next big update hinted someone survios reddit bring audio improvements game

 kontis posted comparison thread  http  iimgurcomurpnkfkpng seems occlusion major feature steam audio offers oculus audio sdk  honestly  could see effective occlusion making big difference presence vr spaces  steam audio examples feature  https  youtube9lywyagsgdc https  youtubey2vqk6pdya0
listen  stop puns 
wo nt work well moving doors though  want sound take different path door closed   
yup  s integrated  exciting times 
love stretch  lol  http  imgurcoma0tsxy screenshot  move around inside green circle  hear different instantly change reflected sound direct reflected  sound setting set highest quality possible  btw  song  
phonon lots different libs  use phonon 3d today virtual warfighter waiting phonon walkthrough  seems rebranded walkthroughm  thats nice
yes walkthrough lib includes propagation  imoulsonic  many libs portfolio  anyway seems  crude  oh well s early beta  propagation way aggressivly cut  plus got alot popping sounds moving around  play around today
actually  even run nvidia gpus  still bit slower 
releasing support different operating systems oculus  well features plugin  research blindly fanboiing
solus project also really good sound presence  really bad aliasing 
nt mind vr  run decent amount ss 
sounds promising  ll keep eye  thanks 
know 
hear  hear 
sounds good  sorry could resist 
hear 
could still traces primary occlusion dynamic objects  would probably artifacts baked bounce though  primary directionality bounced audio encoded baked data could partial occlusion  lighting equivalent  ue4 composite hard shadows dynamic objects directly lit baked areas soft shadows indirectlylit baked areas taking account strongest light directionality indirect lighting cache tracing simplified capsule geometry  would nt expect v1 thing though 
one possibility would crossfade 2 different baked audio renders  one door closed one open 
haha  cheers  noticed instantly cuts  still think would improved outward facing wallscenery sound keep bouncing  m sure  testing time 
wish sample documentation  looks like re assumed implement looking header 
looks like supported platforms list identical mainly boils supported features 
 support different operating systems oculus please explain
must zero sum game 
updated aa  s way better  almost shimmering 
racketnx pretty awesome audio  kind way gameplay works 
ss card running 
pixel crawl happens elite dangerous whileall vr titles great  even supersample 20 think engine needs dithering something 
s best one ve heard day 
bunch loud mouths 
right  mostly dynamic  realtime audio rendering baked reverb mixed needed  due system constraints   ve wanting ability set static mesh s audio material  properties ue4 like s visual properties  type physical material  wood  steel  thick carpet  would contribute s unique sound properties  overall amplitude  frequency response  etc   ray trace bounce hits 
yeah  could probably kind mixed mode  yeah  unity  enlighten  baked precomputed real time gi
hard get artifacts teh transation  throw enough hours anything possible 
easy set unity least  get popping added occlusion reflection  propagation  plus reflection cuts hard  play around tomorrow
installing 
yea bad  misread oculus audio sdk  steam audio advantage occlusion  m sure great though  valve even recommended oculus audio sdk 
operating systems nt necessarily right word  platforms would better  steam audio open  s locked vive require game developed exclusively steam  use sdk vive  rift  nonvr games  additionally  sdk provides least one feature oculus audio sdk nt  occlusion  first never matters  best 
yeah surprised nt mentioned either  sound racketnx definitely makes easier figure ball coming  especially goes warp tunnels 
12 steamvr  085 game ss 125 hmd quality  comes around 13  rest settings high  except ao shadows   980 ti

gentleman  lend ear 
hoping put quake engine  looks like d pain 
 occlusion word post true  steam audio open oculus audio sdk  oculus sdk locked rift require game developed exclusively rift  use oculus audio sdk vive  rift non vr game 
ah header file c header file  imagine docs lower level api even thin unity implementation  
created java bindings porting minecraft mod  ve got say  s actually possible work kinda  create context  compute device  simulation settings  create scenes  add mesh scene  bake render directly  renderers speakerbased binaural one available  although also use different effects simulate binaural audio hrtfs co 
mistake  misunderstood wording oculus article linked    upcoming oculus rift  oculus dk2  samsung gear vr   read exclusive rift  statement much less valid  however still occlusion oculus sdk  curious see oculus responds occlusion andor something interesting 
see documentation generated header file  
know  java version minecraft windows uses openal soft  render audio  openal soft builtin hrtf  enable creating following plain text document   appdata  alsoftini  insert following line  hrtftrue s hrtf re  think re better using openal soft s builtin hrtf  however  re interested taking advantage steam audio s sound propagation systems  reflection occlusion  find way dynamically export everchanging minecraft environment geometry steam audio  think s definite value making mod  fact  d interested trying mod pull 
half problem  oculus shit roculus like  s cool  devs get using stuff world moves  valve shit year line rvive lose shit  oculus   praise lord gaben   htc leading charge   examples  see point   initial   comment bling fanboiing  
nice abstraction  unity case  lower level apis  p start move vulkan dx11 soon  really see abstraction holds
played around bit  alot things needs fixed used production  right propagation cuts way aggressively  real time occlusion like doors  partial occlusion like cloth thin wood doors etc  quick test https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vsukjkvoojmy
’ actually propagation  ’ actually know yet ’ handle stuff properly – maybe ’ even possible  ’ nice nonetheless 
yes  yes see point  research claiming  revolutionary   however  also still stand point first  cool   best  valve vr lead 
nothing 12 months better something 12 months     something one added feature  m sure agree brains work differently suppose 
agree disagree sure haha  s awesome see people able civil conversations  know sounds like sarcasm swear s   nt game  think quote miyamoto explains perspective best   delayed game   eventually good  bad game bad forever  nt highlight situation exactly  think fact valve came something better later  important coming something notasgood earlier  however  100  boat steam audio anything  need really look documentation  mess around compare oculus  sdk  even though s one new feature  chance sdk whole better  worse  oculus

 important part virtual reality sound  really  mean  know s important   really 
yes  exited amd features  nvidia working stuff  s exiting allows integrations digital meta data applied audio processing within level maps  accurate ambisonic playback becomes possible point 
d agree statement  would easy experiment see adds immersion  start vr experience removeunplug headphones  try  time leave headphones close eyes instead 
important much  seriously playing arizona sunshine sucks current audio sound like zombie right behind hes 20 feet away still 
feel s super important experience makes things much immersive  disagree 
d surprised much immersion increased accurate spatial audio  especially barriers 3d audio lifted within vr  s intense experience  almost makes graphics become immersionbreaking reminder vr  sounds encourage users believe actually entirely different physical spaces visuals problems accurately portraying  obviously opinion  ve personally demoed hundreds users stereo 3d audio vr experiences 3d audio demos always comments users claiming could nt believe real compared stereo demo got someone normal audio solutions  devs starting explore sound design primary cue tool vr well  beginning rally design standards around audio concepts exciting audio visual fidelity pushed simultaneously bring high quality vr experiences faster focus visuals 
id say accurate tracking important  doesnt really anything game developers  id agree sound importance  make break immersion

forgot put title  listen headphones 
50  entire experience vr sound design  audio designers unsung heroes vr game design 
girlfriend playing raw data yesterday noticed headphones  ask said  scary sound   finishes try without sound ghost mine  wow  whole different game  try jump scare games suddenly realize  without sound  vr nt nearly immersive  thank audio engineers  great job tying vr experience together  tldr  without audio  vr half job convincing us worlds play real 
would nt say s 50  experience  agree big factor immersion  playing arizona sunshine got mines darkness flashlight could nt handle quit game  game good determined get back sometime later  ran mines without headphones able  still heard sounds speakers distance  really help stay grounded reality overcome fears  s say nt immersive anymore  still scared life felt mine  would say lost 25  immersion 
lot time play headphones im keeping ear something  headphones wrong ear sorry sound guys
audio nt important immersion vr  visual media general like films tv series  said  s somewhat different vr audio sources take users turns movements account 
thousand times yes  devs take advantage audio way  re going immerse player  nt halfass give attention graphic detail  every scene layered soundscape backing  object would make noise real world make noise vr  droppingcolliding objects make noise  every interaction player completes  matter small  needs subtle audio feedback  m constantly unity making little projectsenvironments inhibit  re shit without audio  test without headphones  s awful sony vegasrendered sounds samples freesoundorg  note  anyone making game happens reading    freesoundorg   site lifesaver decade  everything free commercial use long blend audio greater work nt rerelease  amazing 
playing nevermind really hammered one home  directional audio nt well balanced half time feel like ve gone deaf one ear  s one things s done right  ll never notice much s adding experience  get wrong pull right 
replace vr media  great tragedy games industry time audio last thing considered  last disk 
think thats one reason rate elite vr highly  sound design game awesome  ship creaks groans rattles crazy stuff adds grest ambiance playing  especially like use pair headphones completely cover ears playing 
personally think full vr presence composed  1  visual input  sight  2  spatialized audio  hearing  3  body interaction  touch   good sound 33  battle   think  3 missed lot  accomplished hands convincingly interacting stuff vr via motion controllers leap motion also full body avatars mirror body position closely possible 
s like saying wheels like 50  entirety car  sure car without wheels wo nt run  nt make 50

sound definitely important sometimes absence sound even frightening  tactic creators silent hill games used put good use  s nothing frightening imagination conjure sometimes absence sound assists  go noisy scene one sound suddenly brain free imagine worst  dark mine hear nothing  could zombies ready eat  nt know amplifies fear  hear groaning moving  presence zombies confirmed terror turns expectation  good sound designer knows turn sound much know create 
chose read title  50  vr  got excited
totally  music doom 3 lot add tension 
re right draw attention sound design  assign general 50  importance sound design crazy  obviously completely case specific may 10  the blu   50  doom 3  example 
indeed  reminded upgraded surround sound bf1 
use 51 surround speakers  experience different wear headphones  use speakers bass cause beats headphones  also jbl headphones  nt comfortable wear vive  apple headphones suck ass
going say 50  entire experience something back actual research  audio important  nt see 50   visuals 25  hand presence another 25  
play without audio  mainly due phobias sound effects  got ta say tho  still best  1300  yes m aussie  ve ever spent  even without audio love driving around track project cars exploring worlds like m  m waiting sansar atm cause gon na play shit  
m waiting crazy 55 vr surroundsound  yes 1 subwoofer speaker haha  using one sub good already 
ever tried psvr  sonys 3d sound way ahead anything vive offers game  try ps worlds  htc valve better  really sad realizing  selling psvr getting vive improvement everything
would nt say 50  even close  could muted awe
oh   definitely 50  experience  search virtual barbershop youtube even without video  s frighteningly immersive even runofthemill headphones 
nt think ever used vive headphones  always use pc speakers  think perhaps like listen mp3 song buddy flips compression unbearable 
steam vr s developer tools work  tweak settings  would require specialized circumstances  unity  insert audio file  click 3d option  make sure works ingame  s  sound works like re vr environment 
surround sound systems account people turning still require headphones speakers turning person 
might able find someone fiver would lend professional sound share profits ever attempt full game 
project cars version experience  positional audio  simply make car noises louder closer consideration direction  completely ruined game  m sure sounds halfway fine speakers game designed  vr  
s awful  would never know important sound design saw happen  new found respect sure 
personally d say split probably like 60  visual  30  audio  10  touch maybe 553015  guess ends 3  difference numbers though 
need cowbell 
m using https  wwwamazoncomsteelseriesarctiswirelessheadsetheadphonedpb01lyneieirefsr12  ieutf8  qid1483291280  sr82  keywordssteelseriesgamingheadsets things amazing sound  scares shit 
assume  please someone correct   current systems assume re using headsets regarding sound positioning  though 5x support seems viable   though even realistic channels   simple test would  hear audio source right turn head way  move front 
one research observational opinion 
immersed  awed
yeah  well  virtual barbershop 100  audio experience  s saying vr largely visual  even without sound argues lost 25  enjoyment  really depends game  every game designed excellent audio  whereas others depend greatly 
m sure would give sound visuals one aspect percent rating necessarily  back modern vr nt existent yet  pretty fascinated audio similar wasam vr  probably immersive thing could get truly feel like re place else  hearing probably easiest sense  even though s still challenging perfectly  kind felt like already vr enthusiast  visuals tracking fantastic 
keep mind using stationary speakers sound  s impossible receive accurate 3d positional audio  headphones  obviously  move head  game place sound effect 3d space make entire experience realistic  stationary monitor ca nt provide accurate 3d visuals vr nt track headbody movement  stationary speakers ca nt provide accurate 3d sound reason  ps  audio guy wanting help  
dude  whole point headphones get positional audio  get speakers  need try headphones 
yeah  lack directional audio without headphones means re missing lot immersion factor  hearing things behind  holding radio ear hearing sound actually come re holding adds lot experience 
really try headphones least  different games 
games important information audio though  ve tried playing spt without headphones  cripples ability dodge projectiles fired outside field view  thing games requires focus enemies actions 360 degrees  said  play cockpit games often use speakers since forward facing anyway one less piece gear wear head allow stay game longer 
 lots difficult things game development  current tools major engines make spatial audio breeze 
still use system s subwoofer since low frequencies omnidirectional 
comfortable  wearing vive mean many hours u play using
super happy senn 280 s vive https  wwwamazoncomgpproductb000065bpbrefohauisearchdetailpage  ieutf8  psc1
unfortunately nt  think lol  tried using apple headphones could actually tell direction sounds re coming
guess test subjects trials  s kinda baffling say sound 50  since 2 things make vive great sound thing necessary complete gamesexperiences  nt get wrong sound important  s vital many cases  said audio important vr experiences would agree sentiment  giving number kinda weird 
agreed point think s 40  visual headset  40  interactivity motion controls  20  sound  s  m far audiophile
audio immersion built formula vr  ignore discount importance fail engage one two senses currently involved process
appreciate help polite reply  likely noted m vr dev completely aware immersion missing using headphones  looking  immersion  play extra audio cues important  game positional audio folks looking disappear game world  guess m interested convincing game  enjoy spacial awareness vr gives 
spt nearly impossible survive headphones wrong ears   easy vive stock headphones 
even old tools make breeze  spatial audio around  spent countless hours building levels neverwinter nights back day  placing audio around map super easy user friendly  vr capabilities course could place sound cues wherever closer got cue louder got  vice versa 
m home alone  nt need keep ear  nt mind  weightless wireless  really play hour get vr sickness  m working  s stomach head comfort point 
name one game sound name controls menus  test subjects trials measure opinion  5 senses  sight  sound  touch  taste  smell  current vr  sight sound main two  touch still restricted tactile controls estension actual touch  kind weird take issue 
sounds right  way key add visuals immersion  nt played single game yet nails audio  yet still immersive time 
sure  agreed  say s 50  giving bit much credit  nt need half experience valuable 
three senses haptics controllers  sense touch surprisingly big component vr immersion 
ok  re developing platform  would design vr content without vive  sound design game without firstperson understanding whole experience 
could purchase open headphones  providing surround sound experience  amazing positional audio  still able hear world around 
nt use headphones headset  look display mirror 
vive earbud ones come thick rectangle little bit right one easily determine feel ear
since sound 50  would nt fair comparison compare games sound games visuals  black screen  controls  alter question slightly could ask name pc game  vr flat  beat monitorheadset turned without control device  hand name ton games beat sounds turned  also game controls nt game  gameplay way interact game 
ca nt find fault reasoning  know s important   
yes  haptics  forgot  s subtle s important  like longbow re drawing back string  little rumble really makes feel tension 
thanks  nt even notice 
ve games loading without sound  audio output settings using  
bit rant post pretty slow computer s pretty damn frustrating every time sit 5 minute loading screen game finally load without sound   accurately  sound routed pc speakers  vive headphones  way get sound working properly quit game  manually set sound device  wait another 5 mins game load  m well aware setting steamvr autoset audio output vive loads  never seems work properly  also  make things even complicatedconfusing  two vive devices show  htc vive usb audio  htc vive hdmi audio   one meant  set one playback one mirrored audio    nt think ever want audio come pc speakers 9 times 10 still defaults  seems like  game s loaded  s  way change output device quit start  totally idiotic  
created shortcut sound settings desktop  remain vr  access desktop steamvr  open sound settings apply  never needed restart steamvr even remove headset  though need restart game  auto revert settings steamvr never seem work either  m windows 7  might something 
steamvr audio routing annoying seems forget settings quite often  like outside steamvr change windows audio setting  plugging headphones whatever  steamvr audio seems reset  need fixed  audio stuff away vive  always manually check select vive hdmi audio first loading steamvr  pretty sure either hdmi usb audio work fine  either way audio gets vive  really annoying needs fixed least recall last assignment  waiting 5 minutes load vr app maybe get ssd  vr apps tiny anyway loading times nt even thing  mirrored audio unnecessary unless really need something specific  use route audio bass transducers occasion otherwise s real need turn 
add list annoyed users audio settings  steamvr developers take look  feel like got worse windows 10 cu update ca nt say sure 
fwiw  ve found usb audio better job remembering steamvr default hdmi audio 
install openvr advanced settings  option set audio settings vr
steam vr forgets setting pretty often  best advice give start steam vr see sound dashboard  load game re sure default output correct  hopefully ll find better fix 
add list people annoys  bad unless quit game get work 
use voicemeter wireless headphones speakers run make sure voicemeter selected audio 
yeah s annoying  ve tried make part starting process  may way automate something like autoit  nt cared enough restart game 
really need way change steamvr settings within vr
disabled hdmi screen sound settings 
used problem mostly d turn power link box well lighthouse basestations  every time turned  whatever settings set steamvr would default whatever normal audio settings  instead got habit using advanced vr settings set audio inside vr nt hear  thump  selecting something   woo hoo  somehow settings stayed  nt  seconds advanced settings fixed  choose  hdmi usb unless re confident re usb 30 noticed considerable lag video using usb audio usb 20 strangely nt always option hdmi audio s part  guess  using minidisplayport link box displayport video card  sometimes osgraphics card recognizes displayport transmit audio  sometimes  want    https  githubcommatzman666openvradvancedsettings  fix audio problems  course  nt wait till start game check audio  first
unplug unplug turn vive nt use   s probably reason s forgetting settings 
try  steamvr go sound device preferences set computer speakes default  afterwards turn steam vr set vive default  turn steamvr audio default computer speakers turn steamvr default vive 
issue game nt focus launch clicking within vr   desktop   click unity window  almost always unity  sound comes back 
happens game crashes wich quite often wan na load steam vr select game work every time
need set change audio device steam vr  set change usb vive whatever loads  set change back normal audio closing  solve issue 
god  s like dos gaming d
go dashboard  desktop change settings  dont exit game
nt quit game change sound settings
like said  s changing audio device within vr problem  s  even changing device  need restart game changes take effect  re looking 5 6 minutes per load  s incredibly frustrating 
 auto revert settings steamvr never seem work either work way  m exiting steamvr  open steamvr  need manually go desktop change output device vive 
ve found vive audio devices change names forgets  uses name store setting  sometimes s named  vive audio  sometimes s named  usb audio device  going properly switch time  s annoying
thanks info  ve actually started moving one two frequently used games ssd helped things lot 
actually need mirror audio  kids playing  group trying  s nice hear going  seems every update steamvr resets audio options 
might  thought major steam update like two months ago  knows  extremely common problem nontechies would flat confused  heck  us techies still confused  always leave audio control panel open background 
win 10 cu introduced issue  rock solid audio full year vive windows update  steamvr audio settings every time want play vr 
thanks  ll try giving preference 
thanks  already installed  although ability easily change audio output device within vr great  nothing games already loaded outputting audio wrong device…
think highlights something nt   probably  launch vr games within steamvr app rather individual shortcuts desktop   takes program 5 minutes load  m loathe put headset  find game  click  take headset  wait load  put headset  back   whereas d prefer click game icon desktop  let load something else  see s finally put headset  get 
thanks  ll look voicemeter  exactly  besides fixing particular issue 
use well  s nice   note audio apps  voicemeeter routing add significant latency  ran exa  infinite instrument  vr app   soon shut voicemeeter  app became usable 
lol wish still ensoniq soundscape 
    exit game  s loaded outputting specific audio device  changing default audio device nt take effect next time start program 
must depend chipset mobo audio device  asus sabertooth 990fx start steamvr  change audio watch something monitor  start game vr without changing audio back  change audio back  wont sound hmd restart game 
s application dependent  know unity editor requires restart take affect
depends actually  games need restarted changing audio device  holo ball example know fact issue happens time 
well  reset ears yelling 
wow  capslock…  nt exit game  change  audio settings      exit game order changes actually take effect 
unity games  restart game otherwise game nt pick changes  made note self check could add  reset sound  button holodance work around  believe ve seen api  quite annoying development times vive drivers decided change audio device name  always restart unity get audio belongs  reminds  nt happened months  since moved displayport hdmi  using usb vive audio device  maybe could help   
check settings going first game started new vr session 
yeah 
vive two audio devices  hdmi usb  usb one shows usb audio device  hdmi shows htcvive  amd high definition audio device   nvidia whatever string nvidia puts hdmi devices htcvive   switch outputs go vive headset 35mm jack  guess use vive dvihdmi adapter gpu nt support hdmi dvi  makes sense since vr capable gpus  fall back usb audio  nt problem using steamvr setting automatically setting output device though  auto changes vive headset start steamvr every time 
ok  glad hear m going crazy 
personally  find setting usb audio introduces like 14 second delay compared hdmi  ymmv 
s nothing really  windows audio management absolutely awful  five minutes start  maybe look upgrade 
yeah  nt usually launch games within headset either  causing system run slowly yet still able handle vr 
try quick changer windows 10  click speaker icon select new output device drop  seems work better open apps changing default sound settings 
nt would require put headset  find game  launch game  take headset  wait load  put headset back   try maximise time  launch whatever game want desktop shortcut  automatically launches steamvr app well  finally see s loaded put headset   start playing 
welp  put simply  pc even meet minimum requirements vr   yet still seem able run stuff ve tried far flawlessly  despite slightly long load times  fact m running games old sata hard drive rather ssds  ve transferred one two often used games ssd load bit faster 
first world problem  alternatively  disable every audio device windows except vive launching  make vive default 
start steamvr first  make sure audio settings way want ever putting headset  point ll either launch game putting headset within steamvr  however times ve forgotten certainly annoying 
tool adjust sound equalization hdmi vive sound system please  disappointed vive audio strap sound far  
received vive audio strap far find sound flat  come siberia 800 headset sound much richer  wondering could pump bass treble little bit hdmi vive ausio system windows 10 software tool  tried viper4windows wo nt allow change anything  sound stays even modifications   edit   resolved thanks cmdrstamper  using voicemeeter  free donation accepted  works great boosting treble bass   http  vbaudiopagespersoorangefrvoicemeeter
s hundred dollars  siberia 800 like 230330   expect 
nt know issue  vive audio source nt selected primary sound device audio comes tinny like re listening phone 
voice meeter  free  lets mix match audio device  switch fly vive usb hdmi see like best  eq  mic control  http  vbaudiopagespersoorangefrvoicemeeter
control panel  sound  dblclick audio source  enhancements tab  check immediate mode  check equalizer  click 
standard microsoft options  usb audio device  vive presents  bass boost check box 
voicemeeter banana offers full parametric eq output bus  6 cells full parametric eq  8 possible independent channels correct 51 71  
seriously  went premium over ear  headset dangling speakers part  100 price nt even considered  100 speakers 
2nded  2 audio output sources choose get audio play vive  one super low quality  one much better  test changing audio level hearing ringing noise 
looks good   thanks ll give try  hope wo nt bring latency though  
windows 10 anymore afraid
nt see option windows 10 audio devices menus  enable dolby atmos another 71 mode equalizer similar settings 
yep  banana much offer voice meeter  price course 
fine normal games apps  notice latency  correct  may introduce latency software wants full control sound device  daw s eg  cakewalk  cubase  etc  vr app far found exa infinite instrument causing latency issues  s problem  close voice meeter switch back default device want use control panel  finished  restart voice meeter  anyway  music producer similar  using better headphones  100 pair  right  know 
enhancements tab  s particularly sophisticated  ie   might help
thanks man  gave try features looking  great app  launch time want launch vr job   
running time  tray startup  close using app causes latency  ie  exa vr  start back exit  also extremely useful switching mics  one  use teamspeak similar  dont go teamspeak settings change mic  everything voice meeter fly  output  wan na take headphones go back desktop speakers  2 clicks done  also  vr  players wants use headphones  audience  watching mirror monitor  want listen  use voice meeter 2 outputs  headphone a1  speaker a2  sorted  enjoy
guys manage audiosound devices 
headsetmic vive  beginning  every time wanted use vive  would start steamvr  open windows s audio panel  make vive default playback recording d start game  would done playing d reverse options  made automated voiceattack script change ways  unfortunately since changes mic used make change could troublesome use would switch headset vive obviously  recently tried steamvr s setting automatic switch s activeexited nt seem always work often still disableenable headset output window s audio panel even green checkmark vive  guys  manually time  sort automation       edit    thanks guys  m trying something else  already rainmeter skin second monitor current sound volume used space added current audio device  small image headset vive  click uses autohotkey nircmd switch devices  ll check goes 
install openvr  advanced setting  change audio default steamvr opens also change back something else closes  s amazing 
voicemeeter banana  save load different sound configurations inputoutput hardware devices 
manually unfortunately
m aware steamvr  openvr settings adds bunch advanced options steamvr
ve honestly never problem built settings steamvr  also use advanced settings want change headset  sure nt work time though 
least playback  use voicemeeter split audio normal gaming headset 35mm vive  believe voicemeeter also recording confirm used splitting playback  otherwise themadman said  openvr advanced options set playbackrecording devices irc
ahhh ok  must newer update  really never look menu since launch basically  seems like ve updated quite bit
seems like thing already available steamvr  difference openvr actually works 100  time 
far loving application  especially streaming setups  question  s best way control vive audio volume using voicemeeter  slider vive system menu nothing  though mute button still works   know link keyboard volume keys particular hardware device  s really optimal 
looks like    http  iimgurcom9y4edvrjpg   said nt always work 
think big difference interact openvr inside hmd

yeah  prepared mortified pricing  99 absolute best case scenario could imagined   day one price  anything higher interest would diminished quickly 
right  surprisingly acceptable price  would probably gotten anyways even  200 would felt great 
 thinking around 200€  hope audio nt bad sits comfortably glasses

deluxe audio vr good branded open headphones wide soundstage  deluxe strap even closed    ps    one rift open  wose koss porta pro    upd    arguments downvoting  s oculus damage control 
everyone  integrated audio strap makes rift best hmd far  hopefully help vive 
agreed  price going great quality headphones right  probably 
price also cover fixed costs development manufacturing set risk profit  etc  nt disagree point  find high expectations understandable 
ll waiting reviews  like sound earbuds would really buying comfort  maybe eventually sell headband  audio  lower price 
yeah  d rather save  99 lg s headset depending looks  s worthwhen comes  
arguably headphones defined  plastic headband   look  set headphones attach vive s actually comfortable current strap  immediately makes icky feelings go away 
 deleted 
s great price re right  expensive  s still price might consider buying though   100£100 would need bloody good 
ca nt wait june  ordered revolve instead  ships may 
julyaugustseptemberetc  s rolled similarly vive
kneejerk reaction  extra stuff controller  really  pack  30  tracker seems steep   considering probably uses many parts manufacturing practices controller  hopefully ll drive prices fast  pieces hardware 
lot tech  6dof sensor package processor  xmitter  32 lighthouse sensors  lithium battery also usb dongle xmitter pc side  way tech high end gaming mouse sell  99  ideally everything cost  15   nt world works

one tracker 100  wow  3pack  4pack  would alright  200 dollars track feet much 
 price headstrap good  100 single tracker much imo disagree  tracker equivalent single controller  lot small package 
thats dev kit pricing  maybe ll price break consumer version 
issue trackers whether ll become addon games requisite  d hate buy game need tracker necessity play  pose addon  improve  experienceimmersion 
used use athm50s vive dealing cables got annoying  use stock earbuds better cushion  sure nt quite nice ease use ca nt denied  actually excited integrated audio solution 
yes removable 
ll wait order mine amazon
remember shipping nuts  packages  lot  smaller vive boxes  much lighter 
wait shows microcenter 
think shipping figured  us probably  25 max 
yeah thinking  250   130 converted   100 shipping   20 
hopefully microsoft store stock  ms providing free shipping vive 
yeah s ambiguous area well  m leaning toward buy  really wish could try first 
s terrible  totally worth  nt get  erm  cough  well really feel free get nt order order  s definitely instabuy 
early reports comfortable even psvr  easily leader vr headset comfort  s true  instabuy
reckon s going price gbp usd since s almost equal conversion  vat  add bit rounding extra profit comes equal 
never 
someone start preparing order number spreadsheet 
m boat  want strap  headphones  nt want pay headphones nt plan use 
 owners current model feel like getting burned optional extras nt  know early tech  early adopters pay honour  headstrap probably going cost  £100 obtain  ll wait time around think 
2 months really ai nt bad 
especially since hoping d knuckles instead
lol nah mate  consumer grade awesome cutting edge tech s first gen  much hardware software development gone  got ta get paid atleast  price come coming years tech gon na get much better  think events happen human history get vr headsets strapped enough humans faces shoot rec room paintball  shit s cool fuck man reasonable right
used think   saw much stuff many people rmechanicalkeyboards buy  300  400 piece 
compared buddy spends project car even close haha
1080ti overkill  sure  p
anticipation tpcast maxed  final pricing preorder ca nt get soon enough  m lucky enough find current vive strap comfortable need deluxe audio  looks like get save  100 time around 
ca nt wait  s like waiting vive release
nt heard anyone talk audio quality headphones  anything say  detachable  even s easy  would nice case prefer a50 headset  
already one  
 ski goggle straps  makes sound like elastic strap  s 
oh shit
kinda disagree  got ta remember re getting good headset well much added comfort
 deleted 
know gen 2 vive better comes new headstrap  add headphones optional accessory 
think hope  actually  might even third party hmd  better ergonomics  resolution refresh rate   use lighthouse tech tracking  vive 2 think modular sell valve s masterplan along 
eh  considering probably costs  5 upgrade head strap include vive 2  better include lol  m looking forward 2 vives multiplayer 
whynotbothjpg
really want something lets flip vive like welding mask check shit monitor easily  put forehead like ski goggles lenses get foggy gross  weight m sure s possible though 
seconded  wan na know 
hate probably right
long vive  ve maybe month feel like quickly adapted  play hours nt get neck strain like used  ve re still issues would make sure re wearing right 
would cost less half use shipitto dot com 
nt see connection

new rigid headstrap make vive feel much comfortable wear well integrated audio easy adjustment mechanism 
headstrap 
uses rigid strap closer rift uses aside current elastic one got
must play pretty short sessions imagine  ever use rift psvr  vive definitely stands gain terms comfort  mean everywhere else mostly ahead pack  key downside least 
agreed  m happy bluetooth headphones 
believe remove headphones want 
s get 
issue onears  hopefully since re attached headstrap s already gripping head  wo nt need apply muchany pressure  might bad others  fingers crossed 
competition thing free  mean 
 could could    
yeah  mean competition like oculus rift  m sure would charge arm leg comfortable headstrap builtin headphones 
theory stereo beats 71 surround sound using headphones  gamesystem implements binaural sound  nt common   closed headphones might create better atmosphere cockpit style games though  less open sound better match confined space 
3d audio joke  open semiopen cans binaural audio way better imo 
yes
better 200 shipping  
know vive 20 nt come better headstrap  without headphones     
s glued  s removable 
guess s reasonable want better  nonabsorbant cushioning  800 system  400 psvr  seems like defensive fans assuming s attack vive comparison rift  chill  m vive fan  love mine  want reasonable  nongarbage padding  nt even like oculus   psvr  padding  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments5w90wswhatdoestheoculuslosingthecourtcasede8exvk
downvoted honest accurate question  love vive  scrutiny offends fanboy  must expose accurate flaw  come disposable garbage foam   giant wtf  people leave feedback  know people hate garbage  htc must know s terrible  uncleanable  disposable garbage since demo units use cleanable waterproof covers 
versus similar price get three camera tracking rift  maybe bring tracking standard vive 
vive strap easily removable
going well working modes transportation like teleport etc  still looks like junejuly expect gdc announcement maybe 
like every bit huge news  summer pretty epic 
bethesda another presentation  im sure ll find june 
htc charity go business right  sold us cost  htc losing money year year  ship nt get turned around  sink 
lol  first time early adopting  works  adopt early support idea  first ipad came  excited  annouced camera said  hmmmm  apple appley  going wait till 2nd ipad comes   lo behold  camera   got  way works  longer wait better product  usually 
sure year get refrrshed vive strap  new lighthouses  new controllers wireless current 
m guessing headphones pretty nice mate 
nt think ve announced anything either way  considering work must go converting game like vrready  especially given much work  hopefully  means optimization case bethesda game  d say dlcpriced addon cheapest ll getting 
 dolby 71 headphones builtin mic  wo nt using headphones even means cutting saw 
doesnt solve fundamental problem headset pushing ones face  nice improvement  100 
bet comes £30 shipping 
dont tell em    
dont understand anyone would think production costs would high bet still make decent profit even  100   200 something would expected limited production run produced hundreds  bet eventually included stock headset  bet producing quite large quanitites 
guarantee htc people subreddit reading comments like first announced  glad listened 
depends many pucks wantneed  like ik  3 extra pucks min  one two widgets tracking  eventually two extras gloves  used top controllers   view pro market item see soon lot experiences business research communities  games  lot skeptical people paying x times 100 bucks  pile cost headset  vr ready pc  accessories getting insanely expensive critical gaming market exist  pucks early adopters tech  hence htc delaying consumer release date  righfully  
respect  single vive controller   135  single rift controller   60
reviews good  m optimistic  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vvbu0oktgeim  t331s
well g930 s shit  maybe strap better buy price  
open headphones wider soundstage subject outside noiseinterference  trying immerse sight  world would nt want immerse ears  good closed backs give nearly soundstage   also give near total immersion  something neutral eq like sony mdr7506  reason number one headphones studio monitoring 30 years  cutting outside noise seems like top priority wider soundstage vr 
earbuds much better want perfect sound  open  outside noise 
 target market 450k people  maximum number sales possible  exact point time  grow larger time progresses  likely far less half buy  s extremely tiny target market large profit margin per sale make worth producing 
okay  wonder much development required people essentially diy welding helmet mods  oculus already   think may chaps  pay extra  100 something included oculus part base price  get point though  like jigen said  user base currently fairly low guess trying recoup manufacturing costs  would love see actual material cost involved  though 
would really depend good headphones 
ummm  tpcast straps original strap  wo nt need new strap  nt get strap ll probably still using regular one wireless add ons release edit  strap nt wired lol  wire headset cabling s already  s wireless add replaces  wired wireless strap  s strap  wired wireless hmd 
 kneejerk reaction  extra stuff controller really pack  30  tracker seems steep   s likely better profit margin controllers puck really contain everything controller minus buttons plastic 
puck contains electronics controller  plus quickconnect option peripherals  could technically working gun trigger  connecting puck  need gun bluetoothwifidirect 
arent new watchman boards photodiode assemblies like half cost ones used vive remote  could sworn read component requirement cost gone way due new asics chips made specifically lighthouse tracking 
considering buy steam controller 30 basically everything tracker missing compared full controller makes sense think
controllers rumble  pads etc built  s plastic different shape  parts especially  difference manufacture cost probably closer 20   rounded 100  seems okay  provided 2nd gen receivers  able use years come 
mean  aside three buttons mass produced touchpad valve already tons  really doesnt much  complex part tracking bit  
well  consider steam controller  50 roughly cut half get single haptic pad buttons  yeah extra stuff controller would  30 
 kneejerk reaction  extra stuff controller really pack  30 s touchpad  couple buttons  rumble element  sell vive controller  60 two touchpads  buttons  think  30 nontracking part actually makes sense 
stuff likely costs way less re selling 
good point make  people easily drop   100  mouse  since s like lazer tech used changed much 15 years  could probably assume production  parts costs must close 20   reason people complain think tracker  worth  100   personally think peripheralsaccessories start shipping later year 
yeah  30   15  maybe pay cash 
fair prices youd expect youre early adopter gen 1 tech  newer vivewhatever headset becomes king later comes around prices toned 
well good thing mainly devs point  get hands people knows  shit people make m sure use makes worth 100  also price likely drop 6 months release around new controllers lighthouses announced 
 100 tracker certainly outside consumer range  guess readying consumer version trying get trackers devs hands 
 would alright  200 dollars track feet much  idea 5 point motion tracking system actually costs compared vive 2 pucks   looking small lens  puppeteering animation inhome mocap explode technologies  massively lower cost enter fields

lol like s ok  ll wait preorder newegg shipping  399 amazon s free prime  paying extra 25  shipping isnt shipping figured  shipping figured offering non2day option less  25  something like  5  10
htc said available partnering retailers  hope available release 
long time  wait reviews 
agreed  trying might help  m leaning towards buying considering shipping costs involved well buying headset weeks ago substantial amount cash start  might well wait  improved ergonomics headphones would improve quality life somewhat s something ca nt live without
might even removable  ca nt find definitive answer 
availability june means 3 4 months  m also bit bummed 
seriously pc gaming even vr gaming small potatoes compared serious golfer  cyclist  rc flyer  warhammer player spend 
sorry  nt realize worded poorly  meant headsets  viveoculus   deluxe audio strap  based oculus headphones peoples impressions deluxe audio strap though  d say probably pretty good audio quality  without isolation d get overear  
 lol  vive since launch  s totally elastic exactly like ski goggles
meant s another step away  might straight ski goggle strap dk1dk2  s still lot closer cv1 psvr  good progress good progress 👍
hype
let put way  rift already setup price stock vive  saying vive released headstrap setup vive cost extra 100 dollars 
yeah sure  strap great cost  benefit ratio 
yes  steam vr open source  htc took dive option   
 deleted 
well release date one tpcast  assume s road 
nice one  sold
okay thanks  would nt able use headphones right 
guess  headstrap worth  100  sorry dumb question  regular elastic strap nt  impact comfort something  nt used ca nt compare 
seems audio strap overpriced f 
haha even created account point  feel special right 
oculus already lol  vr expensive right either side fence though
 deleted 
friendship drive rattles keyboard keys  s contest seated experiences 
going accessory route  option get new hmd controllers  strap  lighthouses etc   
realized wrote  really important  s small peripheral part m saying  ll edit though  correct 
one first things get vrcover great well worth money
good point  m glad companies offering products give feature parity two headsets  love comfort rift  tradeoff use could nt use glasses 
 yes  s easy 
think bethesda save fo4vr info e3 release  soonish    would make nice pr announced e3 world watching 
junejuly release optimistic  m betting fall  e3 revealannouncement
meanwhile  oculus rift includes comfortable strap builtin headphones   yeah  see point 
redesign fix first fuck  vive great hmd  fact alleviates fucked design strap  see quite blind simple fact  cheaper  say price great sound like corporate shills 
 annouced camera said  hmmmm  apple appley  going wait till 2nd ipad comes   prime example hardware buying calculus  said exact thing  no camera  wait obvious gen 2   doesnt always work way though miss lot experiences follow slavishly 
tpcast third party add costs least  299 d really surprised sold directly htc bundled vive 
new headstrap might included  wireless sure included  s 100  optional  since wo nt work every persons situation  d waste resources ship item users leverage 
nt need headphones  need better headstrap 
talking deluxe audio using marketing hoax headphone    sorry  m getting sarcastic really want encourage use stereo headphones audio binaural synthesis  simulation modeling human hearing digital signal processing   additional 71 signal processing dsp inside headphones pc driver interfere 
lol buy welder s mask  s like 20 bucks
tested  wanted reason specifically nt achieve nt really need  
honestly  options   headset pushes face  b   headset falls  prefer pushes face everytime  nothing fucks immersion quite bad damn hmd falling middle sword fight 
know wo nt sell enough recoup costs  200  exec proposed  200 promptly bitch slapped ceo stomped nuts heels  anyways  point  100 price point recoup costs also deeper invest vive owners promote vive time  like triple whammy threat  much like wireless module ready sale months 
production cost probably nowhere near  100 certainly still nice profit  s one things could ve charged lot people would still bought  especially early adopters  also nt know quality sound would get could gotten lot expensive  m guessing s highest quality  100  s fine  s better comfort m someone feels like want better sound m sure remove builtins 
look much better vive experience  pay get 
lol s  shit   s inadequate terms materials  technology  customer support  bet open source would modded good headset  talking htc  inadequate customer support  vive velcro strap gets fucked like g930 ambuchures  laggsbugsglitches encountered people  though steamvr might responsible nonhardware laggs  usb still goes htc   likle always  hope best  prepare rest 
s thought  strange example  headset worst 
personally much prefer open back vr  s nice use rift actually able hear somebody walks room  also multiplayer presence breaking wearing closed back ear able hear voice  feels natural talk hear things normally 
yes  rule live noisy environment  get closed cans  otherwise s better get open   good closed backs give nearly soundstage nearly  good closed cans always loose good open  physics 
understand  open air headphones less likely induce motion sickness closed back headphones  also open backed sennheisers love audiophiles studio professionals well  studios 510  200  1000 headphones programmers  also  people use studio monitors producing headphones  switch headphones mastering phase 
 earbuds much better 1000  balanced armature earbuds  get good sound 
haptics 
speaking profit margin  think probably getting better margin head strap puck considering difference components products 
awesome  hopefully increase production drive cost  meaning get margin lower price  also pass onto us  
plus comes usb dongle required use 
pass savings consumer could higher profit margin 
s fair enough  nt considered steam controller manufacturing pipeline either 
material costs low  costs starting injection moulding production line costs r  major  right  nt mind extra money flowing developers vr hardware  like incentivise money 
downside owning vive htc valve actually keen making money  nt burning cash gain market share  re achieving anyway  s bittersweet really 
oh sure  think main cost gets passed retail price acquisition manufacturing  plastic fiddly bits cheap need sourced assembled  admittedly minimal cost  understand plastic injection moulding extremely expensive  plastic mould manufacturing might drive   cost  hopefully translating gradual price drops percent 
 since s like lazer tech used changed much 15 years   random guess order make comparison 
end day ll see games take advantage peripherals come using  obviously still nt know much even leg tracking would cool games actually add support  d hate spend money trackers barely supported games  though seems nt issue seeing much buzz produced wait see adopted market 
yeah  seems like strategy actually restrain sales little bit market established 
oh man  nt time look right could sworn told us first announced  hope wrong research get home later
re removable  nt source asked someone  maybe tested 
haha ok  much better absurd pricing near launch  totally agree though getting ripped
s fair compare companies amazon comes shipping  leverage usps delivery services insane  delivery arm  m expecting  1015 shipping  hope using digital river fulfillment still 
removable  said product announced ces live stream 
haha yup
bottom part back  rest  nt stretch 
exactly
 mean s works  product  industry 
oh  see  pull ends mask used velcro keep place  would sit higher face  see mean  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4gnegamassivevivecomfortandfovincrease
well tpcast nt made htc  s sometime q2 2017 outside china 
people pretty sure remove  able  m 100  
early reports generally agree lot comfortable  adjustable knob instead velcro straps  value depends important comfortable strap enjoyment vive  people feel original strap fine  nt sold  maybe wait till people start getting  plenty info    edit  tested video talks new headstrap  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vvbu0oktgeim
nt think s difficult  considering modder able implement skyrim 
agree completely  set   cotton ones though  fake leather ones wanted  wear glasses  plus  reviews suggested leather ones rip ridiculously easily   800 product though  really seems like something included  extra  unwashable  sweatsoaking disposable foam garbagegrade  s cheap  gradually degrades water sweat  leaving marks things  s cheap  m even sure s nontoxic  mean  could nt even give us nonabsorbant material  400 psvr  seriously  foam instead nonabsorbant padding  even slightly think  purely sell  refills   love vive  garbage foam  protecting  unprofessional terrible  m surprised nt gotten torrent feedback foam  learned  assuming good cover gets made strap  ca nt come padded nonabsorbant material first place  seems like s literally reason cheap foam instead nonabsorbent padding   except maybe sell replacements  
m glad  well made hmds good everyone vr general  hopefully settle open standard sooner rather later software side things  way decide hardware appeals us   
yes  pop cover cords go  disconnect cables slide push tabs side straps little rings come right  takes like 5 min total 
take look vive 
m almost positive ll see fallout 4 vr e3 year  last year demoed early version  would make sense d back info year 
 think bethesda save fo4vr info e3 release  soonish     would make nice pr announced e3 world watching  think probably right  m hoping  think would great pr move announce release fo4vr e3 release day following day 
going said  would make sense later initial target

whats opinion delayed launch roomscale gaming oculus 
rift designed way  pretty much year release  vive strap changed people complained s least comfortable headsets  took extra r   time  money 
forgot include motion controls good tracking solution however  charged 
rift expensive include touch extra camera room scale 
products shipped different levels polish  vive shipped completed tracking motion control roomscale cost comfort  rift launched comfort cost motion tracked controllers dealing serious tracking issues  begun resolved 112  almost 3 months touch launch   decide important 
sound clueless person  companies need make money stay business  much money think htc made far vive  m gon na guess little  think things sold   100 unbelievably cheap new strap headphones tiny number devices  nt multimillion run ll economies scale make manufacturing cheap  design r  recouped tiny manufacturing run

s already vive shop website
go third party solutions  want better get better 
excellent headphones nt want deal popping anymore 
well understand words individually 
resting system like psvr uses  however looks like might easier get fit nt require tight annoying get fit feels right  knob back let minute adjustments grabbing side velcro pulling loosening  also rigidity new system might take hang  hmd cupping head  problem waiting consumers get post reviews though 
tested quick review one point event  s forehead strap  strap wraps around front face aside headset 
m imagining every highlevel marketing meeting something street fighter series  s glorious     think sales projections    hadoken 
 know wo nt sell enough recoup costs  200 d sell less half  recoup costs    jk aside  agree s winwin price  consumers nt going feel take advantage  htc make plenty profit high unit sales 
 saying  100 cost actually loss leader 
totally valid point  personally  nt talk vr much find much jarring someone walks near closes door ac kicks  immersion top desire vr   wanting aware real surroundings makes sense 
hence word nearly  understand works   ambient noise moving around  air conditioner  fans  background noise living  need enough  like said  want total immersion vision  makes sense want auditory experience well  course  subjective  seems counterintuitive 
please show source motion sickness closed back  interested 
 1000  balanced armature earbuds  get good sound  dude  talking 
earbuds work  ones get vive work great  stupid enough spend 1k earbuds  opinion meaningless  something wrong 
compared cost 20 sensors thing  haptics probably lot less cost  especially r  terms 
ah yes  
made realize  pucks included haptics  would great bodytracking applications 
https  wwwsparkfuncomimagestutorialswiiremotewiiremote5jpg little black thing red blue wire probably similar  haptics  vive  exactly super pricey 
yet cost basestations controllers still  even without requiring new manufacturing lines  re fooling think issue  items priced major profit margins cuz htc needs make endeavor profitable  think anything else incredibly naive laughable  m surprised  seeing 
valve nt making much money vr  want succeed make games 
  random guess order make comparison  technology 10  microsoft mice way years  nt hard figure bit better build quality  certainly nt 100  comes mice 
trackers aimed diy type people use applications andor custom overlays  nt making apps trackable objects wo nt useful

d love report back wondering thing able confirm headphones removable 
shipping uk still ridiculous  postage 3 1 cable almost cost cable  also nt anywhere like newegg amazon selling parts m refresh ebay daily hopes getting parts need without paying double 
ok  yeah s fair haha
wo nt cheap  charge 25 bucks ship 3 1 cable lol 
talking  absolutely stretchy  sides elastic straps  one go look 
obviously saying worth 100 dollars competitor charge itwas included thr original base  worth perspective  new vives include setup  u wan na  upgrade  small fee  imo
alright thanks
yea default foam pretty shitty default one rift imho
yup  demoed pax last year  time like semi optimized vorpx 
oh wow  know said  ok looking forward maybe
howard say s done  interview week ago saying  fallout going great  s lot work done   s worry fall release 
fair  ve seen zero footage game  even though s game  would nice least see video game action 
relevance  headset controllers still cost vive 
knew needed better headstrap  wanted beat rift market complete product 
personally dont think worth  run usb sound card cable use proper pc gaming headset noise cancelling mic mute switch  best routed mic cable headset 
almost agreed blanket policy downvoting people shout much  learn write emphasize point without reaching caps lock 
might right  regardless seems expensive something ll bundle normal headset  anything would premium sku 
mean website  https  wwwvivecomusaccessory tpcast nt 
think s chinese vive website since s available outside china yet  get info soon m mistaken 
link 
oh wow  s great  idea 
conclusion  get good stereo headphones better surround sound experience fun  see  inner fidelitys walls fame   http  wwwinnerfidelitycomcontentinnerfidelityswallfame  prices rankings nice headphones 
simple nt 7 ears nt need 71 headphones  headphones playing sound high latency end thats bad games 
would assume confidently  100 profitable price point htc  per unit   nt assess product value living  purchase electronic products recognize gimmicks business practices  headstrap worth  100  probably   100  already least one successfully developed hmd proper head mounting setup  htc chose ignore essentials regards comfort push product sooner  pushed vive profit release  acceptable  needs reigned  opinion  affords company leeway invest back consumer base providing headstrap launch  s less year  re  rebuilding  everything charging us full price components without tradein value  imagine way would lose money selling  100  would really encourage explore breaking even  taking lose appropriate encourage current investors  product  6585 maximum 
s preference personal taste way   soudstage still crucial vr  especially steam audio incoming 
earbuds good sound  nt remember model  search re interested 
clearing s buttons plastic 
nt need make expensive  think receive relay rumble commands needed 
actually way advanced typical controlled spinning weight  motors butpiezo electric linear actuators  vive controllers simply rumbling  feedback defined  coupled sub millimeter tracking create sensation rubbing controller textured surface  feeling rails movingrub drawer open closeyou could say actuators work like speakers without membrane
clearing s buttons plastic 
htc margins phones terrible  vr great  htc come back dead vr valve certainly making money lol  went 5 games steam library well 100 one year  think vr operating within expectations valve looking next gen new games controllers really kick things high gear 
nt making much yet ve definitely positioned bleed cash pursuit making vr successful  s healthy strategy  m also glad oculus taking less conservative approach 
ahh dang  personally nt care understand lot people would want use audio hope indeed removable
dang sucks  nt understand nt optimized shipping yet  company big htc would think experience 
elastic means stretches like rubber band would 
lighthouse technology  vive better product elsewhere  rift touch 3 cameras  900  original strap nt terrible  certainly works well rift new strap 
well get comparable tracking rift would pay vive plus strap  rift also sell stuff cheap bundle deal price   
nt know rift  ve never tried one  interested  especially exclusivity bs dividing already tiny game market  m comparing headsets  m firmly vive side  use vr roomscale workout gaming  vive current vr system  want better foam 
last year targeted date todd said things still going good took still time 
 play start finish right  whole thing really works terms interface everything    s still firm release date fallout 4 vr  seems likely ll hearing something     soon  
except pretty much need 3 cameras  s extra   50  unless want 11ish parity vive  need 2 extra cameras  adding  100 bill 
thank wonderful lesson friend 
think bundled gen 2  almost guarantee bundledintegrated gen 2 gen 2 focus better experience cheaper price  wireless certainly increase price therefore remain premium add wish spend extra cash  jmo
sorry s chinese site atm  sure come region pages s ready
could find chinese shop  https  wwwvivecomcnaccessorytpcast
thanks recommendation really looking spend  200 headphones  mine satisfactory directional audio  deep bass  crisp midshighs fraction price m good 
s really reason  otherwise 71 speaker systems would nt make sense  yet work great  s s much difficult surround sound outside headphones  reason headphones work better stereo driver fixed position relative ear transforms audio mimick directionality high accuracy 
difference good set headphones soundstage nearly bad difference ambient noise  guess point  oh  well  struggle never us 
mean saying need  1000 earbuds good sound like saying need  1000000 car drive fast 
true nt expensive  rumble included  developers definitely would integrated games body tracking  would increased immersion  oh well  maybe gen 2 
steal comment wthlee  p idea linear actuators  nt really notice difference vive wands wiimote though  pay attention  ll betcha tech nintendo using  hd rumble  nonsense also 
still worth  100   subjective course  headstrap seems like much better value 100 bucks puck 
 deleted 
yeah  sent email asking high nt got suppliers uk year launch  reply  s frustrating hopefully ll fix things point 
know elastic means 
s related rift equivalent hmd uses pretty crappy gasket well m saying nt issue vive 
last snippet seemed come  hopeful  interviewer interviewee  hope s right though 
roomscale 3 sensors  though max tracking range wo nt nearly large  oculus nt need  deluxe  audio strap head strap already good  end re going spending amount money either way  nt really relevant  especially people 25m×15m smaller play spaces  nt necessarily think selling existing vive users cost  start manufacturing future headsets strap 
actually  need extension cables  usb card  like 200  bill  hey  vr nt cost much incredible experiences 
pleasure  sir 
 think bundled gen 2  nt  sure got impression  think wireless stay addon accessory several years even tp cast successful 
headphones new strap better   dolby 71 headphones  fucking joke 
nah  man  put simply  adding  directional audio  vr adding another layer dimensionality positional audio already receive two earpieces  actively working  d better disabling whatever  surround mode  set headset playing vr 
try monoprice 8323   2159   s plasticy s real bang buck  would nt think headphones price sound good 
 difference good set headphones soundstage nearly bad s bad  soundstage crucial competitive gaming binaural audio 
nope  s true talking earbuds  really nice  thou  detachable cables replace 
think talking different things  tracker s nt rumble  replying guy haptics nt shelf rumble packs  advanced  leads credence idea trackers overpriced since missing trackpad  haptics  etc  haptics saves bucks 
look photo nard imagine designed removable  could easily use twist lock design strap mounts  metal padspins inside connect wires embedded headset  using headphones would simply require twist detach earcups  unplug audio wire hmd tuck away  put back old audio wire use whatever headphones want  even thats case  would shocked nt least rotate back way  re opt stow use  used headset audio right  m really eager try built audio anyways  makes things far less cumbersome removes extra weight headphone cord slapping chin 
yeah  mean honestly would shocked nt removable  ve shocked lot things life hold breath
tweeted asked could offer cheaper  slower option said already slower option 2day shipping  1day fast option  re really stupid 
  800 vive love cushioned extremely inconvenient garbage foam  m surprised bit appalled re still using brand new things  s m talking  want better vive foam  nt care rift s foam compares  nt pissing contest besmirch vive s position vr  m sure ll stay rift   want better vive foam  think s reasonable

rediculously nice hp  want built audio  1 one really going high resolution  high impact audio vr fullest  2 mind  able put hmd grab wands sounds dreamy lol  plug th xtra thing awesome 
maybe  many us good audio solutions would much prefer passable headphones built headset allinone  hassle free comfortable experience 
would rather spread thin making headstraps  offering one tier makes easier stock produce  especially global market  keep making gen 2 content 
use sennhieser headphones  glad integration  one fewer thing deal getting people hooked 
amazing headphones  dont understand anyone right mind would want wear headphones vive  headphones bulky  add weight  fall look around fucking sucks  integrated audio much better imo 
yes   went bought koss porta pros  headphones mode strap  new strap without headphones something would buy 
yea  really  hearing aids stream audio  ca nt functionally use integrated headphones  d end going trash right box  much work keep removing demo  people use earbuds imo  noninregrated headphones actually one reasons chose vive rift  demo d rift headphones absolute nightmare situation  
agree  especially since builtin headphones look like d let lot outside noise  s pretty big immersion breaker 
horse betting 
yeah  nt slip head either   feel constantly adjust make sure keep  sweetspot  op describes  maybe m picky 
re alone  also feel like nt slip away  otherwise playing active games like holopoint thrill fight would seem impossible   get deluxe audio headstrap later today  m excited  
mines nt slip  shifts  headset simply heavy balance account rapid movements  perhaps tightened face turns red would stay better would far uncomfortable 
think op using original strap wrong  said  get point fits properly  tight  starts hurting bit 90 120 mins 
nt problem either  biggest issue earbuds either fall andor headphones use instead bulkyin way 
yeah  actually idea problem people  mine year s never even felt loose head  guess understand people differently shaped heads may problem  never heard though 
depends shape head suppose  mine slips s nt

think least one revision head strap since day one orders  newer ones appear little substantial 
 first problem  read using strap wrong worn much lower head hugs back head underneath  overtop  made adjustment top strap  fit much better securely  feel like uhyperrrr issue 
yea  havent much trouble strap either  s 8 months old  could little tighter  minor sway m really spinning around like raw data level   s pretty minor 
original strap works fine  sounds like op really loose reason 
used rift  nt realize terrible vive s headstrap solution borrowed friend s rift days  multi hour play sessions feels infinitely better also feels worth throw minutes nt mess headphones get started  s also way less fuss people nt used vr get adjusted headphones super annoying multi person demos  really night day difference  vive s solution good s game changer could possibly thought trying 
comfort 555 gram vive original strap pretty horrible compared rift 
well  plastic box insert see image  highly doubt hold whole hmd 
use original wire  nt strap yet  sure whether s less comfortable  definitely works original cable 
use 
post updated answer 
well  hear background noises long re running game  talking regular onear headphones without big contact pressure  therefore almost noise cancellation 
hears game audio onear headphones probably leak like crazy 
regular onear headphones almost contact pressure  fine  even several hours use  laid vive head  feel whole back strap  comfortable  nt thought  interesting 
wondering thing knob right center back  lean back office chair would head resting right knob 
planning sleeping headset 
 deleted 
well  share vive others different head shapes sizes  nt get around adjusting top strap 
nt alone  day one set straps  forgot em since  set forget  issues  even cable messed occasional blackness  m used happening  rarely  btw  getting image back sec two even s nonissue buy new cable  way enough money gadgets  rich nt rich spending money like  
larger heads comfort isnt simple
yeah  nt get  elastic enough slip  elastic weakens time  inevitably   might necessary tighten putting 
looks bit thin  feels bit hardertighter foam face cover  think pretty durable  least time next gen arrives 
realistically  nt ship june 6th  get earlier  would bonus would nt expect 
 sad day 
miss official announcement available preorder  sites screw put early  thought htc pulled early date may said  available june  
concern  ve ordered headstrap  everything works  get week  ll let know  whether s usable   ll return 
remove headphones  vive standard 35mm jack audio connection  nt see problem using inear headphones 
yes 
s want know 
yes  posted elsewhere 
supposed use existing 3 1 cable  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vus6omgwt5rw
hoping nt wait months get one last line preorder 
strap version would realistically 20 30 bucks  s sad htc throwing us apple marketing  money buy original  therefore ll money pay overexpensive bonuses 
d curious see homebrew strap look like

m waiting one  s much bigger roll dice deluxe strap  m nervous  m hoping ll better long run

one newly manufactured vive s weigh rift caveat likely wo nt apply 
think fit children   decide   http  iimgurcomxqfniejjpg  
said  50100 update   actually  bucks  assume us dollars 
 comfort perfect  ca nt complain stock strap likely one once  wont ever want go back  kind things  may fine  s standards fluid limited know  person never good steak may quite enjoy  3 thin piece tough beef 
currently amazon shows june 6th  online ms store preorder last month also saying 6th 
previous danger elastic might wear  since appears rigid  mechanical fit  likely none 
m slightly shortsighted  15  prefer wear glasses vr  nothing changed  issues 
well  comfort iswas absolute weakest point vive  rift psvr hashad way better solutions   extra noticeable us really like active games  multiple hour sessions elite dangerous example  honestly  5  stretchband 900  vr system seem bit cheap  fine development version  marketed consumer version 
heeeyyyyooo
probably like late 2018  even  htc marketing standalone hmd players  namely lg  showing prototype vivealikes   vive 2  nt even visible horizon yet  least  s m rationalizing 
pre ordered live australia
nope  also works flat cable   
note  3in1 cable slimmer profile according someone weighed  exact weight 
 ok  s really needed know  suspicion case  s nt buy immediately   reason  d buy  would significantly improved comfort  s 11 ratio  comfort reportedly much greater  weight distribution aspect nt game changing  even also improved  weight distribution nt 100  equal comfort  s one aspect comfort 
pretty easy mod using welding mask headgear  ve done  s pretty comfy  describe would nt far ops description audio strap  look around  s loads write ups mod  cost £30  http  iimgurcomcfwxqlzjpg
dont buy  one force u  happy pay little extra comfort  nice thing  choice  ps  purpose company make money 
s surprising  pc vr stands huge price barrier entry  htc knows people willing pay probably willing able pay premium addons like  s early adopters tax essentially  vr becomes mainstream ll see price accessories get driven 
however works 
someone owns  lighter  one relationship original strap different everyone nt realise mentioned  much better
got new one already  make big difference 
m pretty sure newest revision vive  nt weighted yet  bought mine january year already got blue hand straps  3in1 cable 
fact able upgrade freaking awesome  absolutely reason another company ca nt make parts vive  s completely open companies busy trying make headsets compete 
nt care much strap overpriced  god damn terrible customer service pisses  m still trying rma vive controllers 
review sound seems others say  sound audio fine gaming  course wo nt compare higher end stuff  easily match headphones ear

8 sold last hour 
unfortunately  sais deliver germany  even europe
 bad    least preordered though  s store could 
onear headphones worst option vr  though  lets external sound reduces immersion
  ridiculous   sorry  ocd 
nt mean could nt sold separately satisfy everyone
already come earbuds leave plugged want 
decent set overear headphones wo nt fall  nt heavy use things nt vive 
s immersive  always wear headphones play  nt mind bulk 
actually heard s opposite  isolation pretty good   source   https  youtubevbu0oktgeim  t95 
maybe  maybe  people open back cans say blending audio room environment sound stitch immersion together  paradoxical may sound 
similar experience  tighten little normally would  s super crazy uncomfortable  feels tight  fixed shifting problem fast movements 
ca nt speak op  definitely using wrong  tried every configuration imaginable experience exactly problems described  edit  jfc  people bloody blinkered  head size  relative ear eye positions  shape forehead  depth superorbital ridge  occipital nub  factors achieving comfortable  secure fit head strap like vive s bit cheap elastic three velcro pads minimal adjustment range objectively going cut universal solution  yes  people probably making optimal use limited adjustment available  way lot dogpiling  d think htc s strap pinnacle ergonomic engineering anyone issue mentally incapable operating shoelace 
think people iron foreheads  shape facehead better distributes weight face gasket  obviously enough people problem comfort otherwise would nt making new one 
yeah  people top strap waaay tightly side straps tight enough  top strap loose triangle cup lowerback head  tighten side straps s comfortable 
notice lot people wear wrong  nt pull back enough stop soon feel resistance  pull strap part skull called occipital bone back skull  pull onto part yes going slip 
also depends hair style would assume  someone buzz cut would probably much less slipping someone 2   hair
 s definitely  comfort fitting issues cheap nasty headstrap shipped upgrading  s definitely idiot wearing wrong apparently 
tried lowering strap bulge back head  might clip ears bit  keep slipping much

exactly  even get downvoted opinion  enthusiast consumers really stupid sometimes  blew enough cash vive sell big profit  go ahead guys buy release overpriced stuff
especially  since d expect  comfort  strap would part vive beginning  considering premium price 800   htc starting piss  130  price way much  want comfort  ll able use vive 30 minutes  nt really care audio add  guess would easy sell 2 products  without audio  since audio manualy removed anyway   hope soon competition steamvr hmd space  way htc think awful pratice ripping customers

""
tested couple minutes  think weight distribution improved significantly  headset feels much lighter especially quick head motions 
s point  wo nt buy price point default strap first place  choice nice kinda shady move 
 vr becomes mainstream ll see price accessories get driven  ideally  stuff like wont optional accessory year line good ergonomics builtin audio become standard day 1 
remindme 
waiting order microsoft store deluxe strap launches put order  recently bought oculus rift weighs revised vive extremely noticeable weight difference 555 gram vive 
nah  m talking fact family nt much problems average user hmd falling everything  add strap perfect
fixed controller  even bother damn support

wanted one austria  damn  guess wait another 3 weeks
thought realized much sweaty workout vr games  switched onear headphones much comfortable active sessions
always  personally nt mind reduction immersion prefer keep connection family outside world  full disconnect reality get earbuds sometimes negative 
 deleted 
pair bose onear phones cancels noise incredibly well 
immersion metric  state mind  partial suspension disbelief therefore entirely subjective   like  complete disconnect reality helps immersion  others disconnect distracting even anxietyinducing able keep ear help relax allow immersion happen  everyone 
really  live really noisy environment  personally much prefer open ear tell somebody walks room instead walking startle tapping shoulder  also idea people walking around without aware kind bothers 
completely disagree 
take dark lord  auto spell 
 ocpd  sorry  actually ocd 
selling millions maybe s small market right overhead producing another product would eaten savings could pass consumer  s cheaper everybody one version 
well  let outside noise  especially game quiet  noticeable  hand  sound immersive  directions distances sounds coming  better distinguishable  also  ve heard one oculus owner  prefer using headset  many said prior launch  would nt use inbuilt earphones better ones  release  everyone said comfort fiddling headphones much important slightly better sound 
well  kinda makes sense think  even use closed headphones  watch something speakers  always get surprised hear like knocking door  phone notification  s m sure  whether s real life  gamemovie  guess applies open headphones  whole time ca nt sure  whether sound really came headphones  get immersed  also strap  earphones much less noticeable headears  feel less  like headphones 
comfort nt reason  lot quicker put  nt chore start vive 
downvoted going hive  fucking sub 
yeah  every time hear people complaining vive resting cheekbones know exactly wrong  even  heavier  original version vive nt feel much heavier oculus nt  nt even wear straps tight  hurt 
yeah  s  get facetemple pain though tight side straps pulling vive face  know mean 
people  pulling far means d either strap ears  digging  generally nt problem strap fitting tightly since giant head  girlfriend nt like comfort s either loose uncomfortable ears
hair past shoulderblades  slippage 
bbbut paid much hmd  money nt issue      wwhy nt buying  30 1 hour games new best  genre  game vr

oh jesus christ  comments  yes haha talking bigscreen 
absolutely problem  nt get point making post ve actually used something tell us  updated s helpful post  nothing click bait 
get onto chat htc  got new sent warranty runs
fair  market small much choice  m sure htc could less dickish profit margins  s nobody else making components  s simple supply demand  control     supply  high pricetags   incentive thirdparty addons  s really nothing special tech outside controllers basestations  nobody seems coming plate bat  however  options ve got

strange  choose express shipping 
nah sold mine ebay 69999 end  100 upgrade 2017 revision  bad  unless another  100 audio strap launches like back april  come even swap 
got sick discomfort point stopped using vive  granted lack killer software helped 
mean  saying ignorance bliss  lot merit 
https  wwwbhphotovideocomcproduct1337111reghtc99hamr00100vivedeluxeaudiostraphtml
good know  would worth either way s huge bonus 
saying  htc tried develop headstrap release vive  nt enough time  released know  developed better headstrap  nt think price unreasonable  revolve similar price point  much worse quality  think profit  2030  reasonable something many people buy   like vr games  usually cost non vr games  although agree could release version without headphones like  40 less 
would rather waited vive  cause companies also need time develop stuff  certain point go otherwise develop forever without releasing single product  controllers also perfect new controllers give huge improvement  cost additional money well  industry works 
yeah  basic accoutrements like start included hardware  consequence first generation vr things still developed improved upon high rate 
anyone help 
actually referring usieden newer  lighter hmd unit  curious see someone firsthand experience launch vs current one thought weight difference actual use 
oh agree completely  nt audio producer subreddit  p main job sound production  totally know re coming  also know start using big words gamer friends look like deer headlights 
1 left  edit  restocked supply 
press home button get camera
want keep one foot planted real life access external sounds  absolutely benefits certain lifestyles  nt discount fact immersion reduced important thing vr aim 
agree blocking access voice reduce immersion  however situation describe involves wanting fully immersed vr  s preference also prove onear headphones reduce immersion facilitate
think might ones  small  silver  batter pack left ear  ve simply incredible  take ear even notice people room 
m sure  deluxe audio headphones nt bose  feature thick padding expect  instead sit flat ears  leaves lot gaps  furthermore  headphones passively cancel sound well inear headphones overear headphones simple nature 
disagree part  immersion provided system  perfect system  hope see vr one day  would feel though re unquestionably different dimension  aka matrix   requires replacing real world stimuli appropriate stimuli dimension  people nt like completely blinded world either  hmds nt viewing holes keep track environment reduces immersion provided system 
re describing preference open ear based lifestyle  re demonstrating exactly open ear headphones provide less immersion  core argument  want aware re still real world  s understandable  s immersion 
would interested hearing reasoning  although suspect may already answered one replies post  said  ideally vr equivalent teleporting another dimension  relying hardware available  mean completely blocking stimuli real world environment  way hmd makes blind world  therefore  headphones allow hear real world sounds less immersive headphones completely block sound  helpful able hear real world sounds  factually less immersive nature  utekhamatom pointed  one downside able hear voice  however  argue mathematically  listening re talking  therefore important headphones provide immersive listening experience  disagree statements well 
possibly mistyped ridiculous often enough learned word 
nope  ca nt say ve ever comfort issues vive  started wearing correctly 
s long hair issue  vive strap sucks long hair  ca nt grip skull properly long hair cause slip unless really tighten

 take ear sounds painful  
cut makes hyper aware fact could sometime room something might need attention d idea  m entirely unable give immersion  making s possible hear sounds happen  stop worrying let immersion take away immersion mental thing  s different person person 
even could perfectly replace sensory input  still know s real  immersion comes willingness accept input real  ish   input  course real easier accept  root argument  agree  s still subjective spoken absolute terms 
 re noisy environment ads immersion hen nt feeling buds ears whole time  also completely blocks natural noise  giving feeling artificiality rather feeling like nothing ear hearing

 kein versand nach vereinigte staaten von amerika   shipping united states america 
dont
nt matter often happens  suggest often  responded based description like hear doorbells phone chimes  possible headphones allow external sound  argument thus far allowing external sound immersionbreaking  benefits  s separate discusssion  also represent one case  whereas m sure people deal occasional car horns  birds chirping outside  computer fans  etc 
incredibly  cleaning mess first time family finally understood disturbed entered vr 
oh  re asshole 
 know exactly cheap crappy never said either things  make sound like previous strap literally nt work never said  maybe nt know re talking since everyone tried one gone ape shit difference makes m sure makes big difference  expected   never said bad  said overpriced  nt try   nt  strap  s like big science behind  edit  someone else made another good point  make headphones optional instead forcing users buy artificially inflate price whole thing 
nt understand said  part happy clarify 
would take ages ship anyway  least 10 days experience  able buy us  good luck hunt 
 tons bike helmets equal better strap designs  claiming know quality strap  statements somewhat hyperbolic sense inaccurate   never said well never said said  said   make sound like means choice words suggests certain thing   thing headstrap mediocre headphones glued additional 100 bucks  s insult  s  much exactly  maybe reread earlier comments  say bad act like know bad  fact make sound like previous strap garbage

hourish  final performance fixes testing
yeah good point
s 
would love implement s difficult override  ground plane  vr  doable  tricky  ll try make happen future  promise 
would bedroom environment work screen ceiling bed  re mainly asking able cinema experience  ignore   
https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments6phdqebigscreenbetacinemaupdatelaunchestodaywithdkpi131
s 
highly recommend actually try bigscreen everything re asking    tvs  fully adjustable movable curved screens  brightness adjustments  big  presentation  screens walls  cinema screens imaxsized  100ft   home theater screens  etc   yes  nt handle 360 180 video right  maybe later  3d sbs  3d ou  inverted streams  yes recenter view  switch seats  fully navigable worlds  screen face  nt video player  video player like mpc handle subtitles audio streams  nt really cinema app  s full tool lets anything pc  including watching movies cinema   let know think  m super open criticism  ve got bugs ll fix
nt know answers know    sort 3d support   side side etc  another app allows switch leftright eye streams  ve found useful videos  support sbs ou    recentre view  seat switching  recenter view menu    support subtitles  andor switching audio stream  positive  think saw subtitles option   m sorry multiple questions  like 3 cinema apps installed already  probably wont find time install anything new weekend  hurt trying free  edit  formatting
got kicked owning vive lol
wan na know well
depending environment  yeah much much much better performance  still even perf work  users   reporting random  bad  performance glitches  investigating  overall though  big leap perf 
static sound means mirroring device set 441khz sampling rate  switching 48khz audio device settings  advanced panel  fix 
would really helpful send list things notice nt working properly  even happen seem random  re focused bug fixing next days  hit us discord bugs please 
hit us discord still issues  really major update  s fantastic lots people  still may bugs  especially desktop audio   re working patching bugs asap
sounds like bug  lem help debug  cpu  gpu  graphics card drivers properly installed  environment  s cpu like singleplayer  assume vive 
check bigscreen settings  audio  playback devices  select different device maybe 
s sporadic bug  hard trace  cinema  re looking  hoping fix next day two  update tomorrow might fixed
maybe updates automatically already updated  best way check  go environment check want new cinema mode
autoupdates enabled steam  open bigscreen  go bigscreen settings look version 0170 bottom
add frame limiter  cap rocket league  otherwise  rocket league try render hundreds frames internally  using gpu  try turning vsync lowering settings rocket league  s gpu  highly demanding environment like cinema  play modern games max settings  gpu probably entirely consumed game  giving bigscreen barely gpu render anything  recommend gaming void environment
wait sure  absolutely goes pitch black  gray purple  rift  nt tested cinema vive yet   imagine s  better  vive due way lenshandle colors  possible individual headset programmed worse black levels smear issues  actually postprocessing image effects like dithering make sure gets even darker without ugly graypurple smearing 
watch real people one 
sadly d manually change resolution implement native video player bigscreen  planned   s nt know resolution content desktop  169  movie rez like 2351  etc  know resolution whole desktop  could try detect black bars cut  would performance intensive prone errors think 
ran issue already discussed d2shanks  yep  ve got switch monitor res 1920x1080 opening bigscreen  talk first world problem   hey expensive ultrawide monitor causing issue virtual reality headset virtual cinema application    ideally way bat file script switch res automatically launches bigscreen switch back close app  googlefu better mine let know solution

wanted sure made tests  first try  one two controllers disappeared  however  controller disappeared 34 next tries  perhaps bigscreen strict  controller stay perfectly still  could reason  made experiments home cinema environment  cinema environment added update   nt know feature depends environment  also take opportunity warn potential issue deluxe audio strap  wondering low quality sound bigscreen  bought das days ago   reason sample rate sound device set 48khz  sound perfect changed 44khz  honest  nt know s something changed  sound normal vr application settings  could good idea check sample rate user s sound device switch 44khz s set 48khz 
consider third  also netflix watching lying flat back  due back problems   currently use virtual desktop  supports  barely   bigscreen gets better support  d switch 
thankyou explanation  ll see giving go get chance  though  sounds easy  ll interested see goes selecting videos vr  expect wont problem   would hate think ll need take hmd go computer every video play something new  fullscreen picture  example  spent like 5 hours vr day watching full length 3d movies back back  well episodes assorted anime nt caught  nt leave chair  everything motion controls  navigating inscene menus  bit rant know  thought detail use apps give real world use case 
 fucking rich people man 
output1 70kb output 2 115kb granted played maybe 45 min hour crashed 23 times  assumed due cpu load 
found speakers set 24 bit system settings  set 16 bit could start hearing people big screen  everything seems work except try stream audio either get major echos ca nt hear anybody speaking  also get random crashes seems ca nt stream 5 minutes everything freezes 
switched vive hdmi audio usb audio pretty much solved problems

d recommend vlc playlist  ll stay fullscreen whole time without leaving fullscreen sbs3d mode  create proper native video player  fiddle desktop  control full desktop  apps  right vr bigscreen  using controllers keyboardmouse  nt need take headset 
 would hate think ll need take hmd go computer every video play something new  fullscreen picture  bigscreen desktop vr   video player  nothing  nothing less  take hmd ll see monitor vr screen 
ll update couple days  could try  ideas might cause 
go last night everything runs lot better also like new large cinema mode  good job

obvious reasons  first thing tried avatar 3d  nt realise looked wrong found switch leftright eye option time later  two looked  much  better star trek movies  darkness  beyond  nice 3d  s wikipedia page somewhere listing motion pictures last ten years 3d  d suggest picking anything like  playing vr media player choice see  even 2d stuff found really great watch vr  cinema atmosphere great  even though re sacrificing visual fidelity right get 
make sure true 3d  eg  depth perpixel  postprocess 3d re good  depends movie one use  postprocess 3d looks like cutouts true 3d

hasnt hour far im glad say still
finally time try  good news  liked  love easy move floating screen touch controller  nt seem way adjust tilt  screen always pointing forehead  m accustomed screens pointing chin  minor thing  nt bother actually started watching videos  bedroom environment  settings spent minutes adjusting  seat  distance  size  curvature  nt seem remembered next launch   settings remembered used one space 360 environments   overall  bigscreen works better virtual desktop  use space environment  complaint need recenter headset laying  ideally   perhaps typical user   would remember setting also 
 tyvm taking time reply 
update attempt trying bigscreen weekend  soon try start errors  microsoft visual c runtime library   application requested runtime terminate unusual way  please contact application s support team information   happens every time try start  immediately  closing error dialog nothing hang indefinitely 
said  able navigate folders things select video play native vr highly useful  able change bunch video settings may currently restricted options changeable within player application 
oh  mostly understand bigscreen  thing cinema update stuff mostly video player related  rather s things work better   vr trying run desktop  think   
sure know ye talking  say one acquired versions  would go playing bigscreen 3d 
s sad annoying  regular players would show leftright images instead actively detect s 3d bluray show one images could enjoy 3d bluray collection bigscreen without ado  found blog describing  long  step step tutorial watch 3d blurays bigscreen without rip  nt find energy follow  maybe  old version media player bluray capabilities would show left right images 3d blurays 
1080p streams 14mbps
wipe floor  sitting beside someone also hands make hand gestures draw stuff mid air insane  super excited try new imax size theater tonight       also crazy everyone see others desktop  like virtual lan party  play  couch coop someone online lmao 
watched prometheus 3d  worked great getting sound order  could hear others talking movie though  sound needs tweaking sure picture good viewers apparently 
fixed minutes  check steamoculus update
install try bigscreen  restrictions desktop applications  works normal acts like outside vr 
m sure bigscreen  believe options display format movies re playing  understand able pick correct format options  accessible via little floating tablet  work  ll need make sure select right option  sidebyside vs overunder etc   sorry ca nt specific  nt really watched anything 3d bigscreen  last time tried dk2 different program   imagine guides around though  might need set eg  vlc something play actual file 
make sure side side videos topbottom  play regular video player like vlc toggle option type bigscreen settings  video another 3d format  bino3d videoplayer convert format fly 
thank 
sat days ago watched last week s star citizen atv youtube video using bigscreen  try  holy moly  ll probably never consume media outside vr family asleep  tried several environments finally settled movietheater one  really made watching videos whole different thing  s hoping gen 2 vr hardware higher visual quality fill last gap 
nt think understand  able perform actions native vr useful thing 
alright worries   thanks help sorry many questions know run something like svp4 mpc bigscreen  read mpc support run plugins time 
oh nice ill give try  thanks info

yup  shoddy product made htc confirmed  seems like incompetent nt realize obvious flaws products re pushing  disappointing 
mine afternoon  ll report back well

uvrcover uvrcover uvrcover help  plz  come call three times right  edit  send picsdimensions needed 
yay add another  30 price  htc owns vrcover confirmed 
seems sweat related  nt sweat  wo nt deteriorate 
many people longer today though  ca nt many yet  officially released today

might effect ones mass production   jesus christ htc  ll know soon enough 
reviewers nt use new das extensively instead pushed review asap  even utribalinstincts missed huge flaw initial review  horrible job  htc 
first thing asked noticed  none

yikes  m glad amazon sold could get  gon na wait see offer solution 
deluxe name  deluxe quality  unfortunately  htc milking existing customer base  lead backlash  ll gone gen 2

 base stations excellent guess never heard defect base stations ppl send back offline leds
 deleted 
thats basestations pretty much valve s design 
sell bs  low quality controllers  crap straps  async spacewarp  lol
expect htc  idea behind base stations came valve  anything htc made big failure far 
imho  included headphones quite acceptable  comparing sennheiser hd 555s 280s  isolation nt full spectrum  deadens outside sounds leaves lower frequency leakage untouched   headspace  good  somewhere 280s 555s  binaural rendering works well  bass little overdone  compared sennheiser​s profile   mids seem dampened muddy  another gripe standing path fan induced significant noise times  comfort good  better  edit  connector headphones removable 
haha good authority guy never claimed quality journalist  said  would want someone wait hear back company warning people component product defective  thing went sale today  would rather someone wait days everyone paid money release information might influence decision buy  m far interested providing honest information people watch videos catering companies  real  physical  issue  sitting information would nt help anyone  htc included   fuck guy  seems bit strong directed guy s trying help people  also  htc blasted  mention like product hope early unit  even go talk m issue others seem  think completely wrong condemning release information like  d love hear reasoning behind  nt software vulnerability warrants giving company time fix going public  piece hardware already shipping customers hands  damage already done  actually helps htc fix earlier avoid shipping replacement padding compensate 
lot people canceled orders due  nt know  foam replaceable  anything htc issue replacement foam weeks need  would nt buy  waiting rectified missing enjoyment

wow  people like enable htc behave shitty every time push new accessory 
lucky s okay   kind residue hair 
see looking  mentioned video  would think information would great know  htc send us 2 spare replacement foams  better quality  compensation  easy swap face masks nose protectors im sure much harder

good news  deluxe audio straps deteriorating foam superficial washed 
""
 seems like s less foam actually  deteriorating  like s residue something left manufacturing process washes  issue seemed strange cropped issue foam  would nt use foam face cushions  tell  looks  like foam   waiting mine ship  ca nt really compare properly yet  anyway  good know foam nt actually melting regular use 
 removed 
good  htc still update manufacturing process remove residue 
still fault  one bad originally thought  highly doubt designed foam nice finish  comes person s head  gets hair  point scrub scrub foam nice finish worn re left underneath  htc still need fix s hardly good user experience 
looks like  m looking forward utribalinstincts full video 
hopefully story scare enough people away next time gets stock order sells  hehe  foam badddddd
sheds bit new  basically fine 
someone page uyellowturdbig
anyway  big shoot vrcover likes  develop market  faux leather  nicer material padding das  hated foam hmd ca nt use ones vrcover 
honestly  whether washed  htc needs send replacements asap  talking  100  deluxe  product  circumstances anything like happen without corrected  lucky hell designed modular way instead replace entire thing outright  fix s plain bad business frankly pretty embarrassing 
could tested saying foam actually deteriorating 
thanks  debating getting new strap problem
https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vl2u6tdeds34  featureyoutube 
got mine wanted see residue  definitely  thing vacuum cleaner filter  dunked warm water  squished around  water bit greyish  drained water second time water clear  nt scrub since afraid damaging  still  five minute cleaning m confident wo nt getting hair dyed black  big sigh relief s foam deteriorating 
htc shipped instructions install head strap separate box  literally whole box one sheet paper  anyone else get 
m putting vive wash s
placed order  ll wash get put foam back dries  forget  phew 
 deleted 
bad news   100 product requires wash part  s price  ve never problem 
huzzah 
good try chinese manufacturers  ai nt buying  s
chuck wash like foam face gaskets  mine time throw bra bag wash problems 
good news  noticed mine coming first use  s nice know wo nt erode away nothing 
dont know  absolutely poblem das  easy put foam install new one use something like vr cover protect like  das must  ca nt imagine going back old straps lol
sure qualifies  good news  
s stuff washing peeling rub  deteriorating book  nt matter looks ok re done 
yea  m  ll wait official replacement piece using 
rage anger turns residue left manufacturing process  lot drama little 
s constantly creating drama views 
yeah   m putting something like head without knowing wtf mysterious  manufacturer  residue  d prefer grow set fingers growing back  second head 
nt left residue  s glued coating gives foam velvet texture  s supposed rub  seems like used poor quality glue applying coating 
confirm seems case  wet finger rubbed along padding  dark grey bits came away  stopped thin superficial layer removed  leaving undamaged foam  strange 
 looks like foam looks similar feels quite different 
foam face cushions  cheap unpleasant touch foam 
face cushion foam deteriorated first uses face  left raccoonlike dark marks around face  wash stopped happening  probably foam  one else happen face cushions 
nice call 
nope  get  ll know  s suppose come 
may anti microbial
agree  customers wash piece foam padding meant skin hair  ll  m ambivalent  also thrilled layer could made  especially since would contact skin  shaved head  nt learned 
s like dirty layer left manufacturing likely  easy fix  needed wash thing anyways 
oh ffs thread  s fault s extremely common types foams
rare case likely happen anyone know
full video  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vl2u6tdeds34
ive got second one coming going return  unless someone wants purchase
apparently  see rub hard  cleaning  balling material left thumb  s  s soaked water apparently exacerbated issue  case issue roughly equivalent  hairs car tyres   https  d3vl3jxeh4ou3ucloudfrontnettire  20hairsjpg  wearing  totally inconsequential 
please nt feed trolls 
find something else  happen htc  s sill crappy product  etc 
nt banned 
pique vr enthusiasm 
hahaha
yeah m  even without foam defective want replacement
one problems faux leather making sweat like 10 times foam  feel increases risk damaging headset especially   hand  absolutely welcome one das wo nt directly contacting skin 
foam hmd strap completely utterly different 
nt think utribalinstincts needs apologize  simply pointing something discovered trying help deciding whether order  s htc needs apologize s htc put info soon tribals video explaining could washed  tribal could figure day surely htc could figured minutes 
thought story  jumped actually figuring going  people reacted story  without actually knowing going  like news
 deleted 
yep  hilarious  kind big box  like almost big headstrap box  open box  take padding  single sheet paper  moment  looking paper lying facedown  pretty sure invited wizard school tour candy factory  disappointing 
yeah  got mine today  thing   weird  box sheet paper  receipt sheet paper  big green air pillow keep piece paper safe  guess 
 instructions came box  warranty book 15 languages  instruction book 15 languages whatever  didnt get 1 sheet paper  ordered microsoft 
luckily foam simply attached via velcro  take  wash put back easily 
 100  s 5 minutes  nt make worse already lol  p
ca nt think single  100 product nt wash least little using 
like  seems batch problem  others fine  quality control issue  design defect 
extremely common overreacting
would replacement s actual defect 
guess re never using vive
still nt happen  least s bad situation previously thought
lowering defcon 2 
s residue  s meant permanent finish meant stay put  look washing  soft  velour finish  adhesive holds comes 
seems way less dramay youtuber ve seen   drama  videos ve seen legitimate concerns 
s big greasy fool 
except people nt morons like said right away hope s anti microbial layer comes right s fucking common products
dual process second head  ll sleeping das 
wash  likely anti microbial layer
must crap glue used rubber pad trackpads  come htc
concur  got mine hour ago definitely deliberate finish coating comes gets moisture  least mine nt come easily completely dry 
got 4  2 newegg 2 htc  htc didnt cancel order shipped anyways   4 rub 
would likely either mould release agent potentially anti microbial layer  could nt tell vids
actually think foam feels way softer touch face cushion foam 
happened well 
love black antimicrobial fuzz hair 
going put washing machine 
nt wash clothes wearing first time  nt wan na know happend piece clothing sweatshop 
re concerned foam goes face  like lmao
sure s annoying  washing anything comes direct contact skin using 
yeah question whether s  extremely common   ve never bought wearable product residue rubs touch 
s delivery date  m interested  missed first wave 
roughly equivalent stretch  hairs cars tyres nt give negative experience  crap coming strap gets hair nt scrub first  s like need go scissors cut car tyre hairs 
m sure thinks s troll  blocks people argue back  nt typical troll behaviour  seems utterly convinced moral correctness position  m going deluded trollish 
new tone seems sorrow rather rage   s really sad htc think people  actually feel sorry customers   maybe s new pills 
sub zero moderation thus every discussion taken oculus trolls 
stubborn  repetitive  biased contrary arguably sufficient reasons ban someone 
would  talking negative htc nt grounds ban 
vr enthusiasm shows shitposting reddit actually playing vr
nt really make difference far vr cover able design pleather replacement
true  would prefer product would  touchwise  simillar vrcover offers interface  kind faux leather  vinyl material 
sense rushed release video good reasons somewhat backfired  released new video  thus nature trying forefront information 
 concern raised surely htc due diligence find sure happening  takes time 
think trying stress caution people pulled trigger buying something may able return felt semiresponsible recommending people already ordered discovered something potentially dealbreaking 
fair  guy fairly positive review may influenced people preorder  first instinct something like happens probably nt put water see far goes 
m expected update  3 says deteriorating cushion dried 
straight said foam deteriorating due sweat  huge    absolutely massive  issue  nt imply minor shedding seemed like entirety foam affected  thats held back ordering one  seems quite people cancelled order based false premise  m glad correcting 
blame russian hackers 
ahhh yeah think htc orders
whoosh 
 deleted 
know always put new smartphone wash  least  
computer hardware  vive  depending definition wash course 
yeah  gotcha  regardless  someone htc nt job correctly  m gon na look getting one anyway  comfort looks good pass 
hell  m reacting less lot people canceled orders  common 
still defect  major one  fake suede like covering foam coming  s supposed come  nt ruin anything 
clearly defect 
ones wear face  oculus rift nt issue  majority vive users nt either 
ll wait buy one  quality issue  deal breaker  money charging  s acceptable   
yeah s crap
yup  buy entire new controller trackpad crap  real cheap shit 
also confirm got new strap today immediately tested residue licking finger rubbing foam immediately came finger  took foam strap washed sink cold water removed residue foam perfect nothing rubs anymore 
bring microbes
 skin deep  vid  assuming coating make foam smooth nonstick  perhaps get cured high enough temp sensitive oils prevalent caucasian hair  asian hair 
still rather unacceptable  regardless  crap going head  s gross 
definitely velourlike finish falls moistened 
s definitelysofter  s unpleasant feeling  feels like m touching magic eraser
""
soooo fucking washit 30 seconds fuckin sink gone big deal fuck 😂😂😂
 m going wash actually notice coming normal usage  found far comes gets moisture  nt sweat much  finish comes nicer plain foam underneath 
wash helmet wearing  shoes headphones  seems actual physical layer  minute amount bleach chemical left manufacturing process 
legitimately ca nt believe people still defending  nt wash fucking product intended used electronics  get new headphones also detach new earphones wash strap surrounding

wash controllers  guys 
supposed detach foam set headphones wash black residue stops visually falling 
 types foams
amazon today  extra one microsoft tomorrow
re supposed trim   damn 
suspect anyone sweating enough dislodge crap negative experience hair anyway  ve seen amount crap pretty excessive  reckon htc add washing step manufacturing process  perhaps meant washed 
oh  hair might get  gasp  messy  surely signals end times htc 
know people like irl  maybe quite bad  alot research buy product based  point  everything else market shit want tell everybody made right decision  product ability research purchase something based  question product  question intelligence  s lesser men 
good point  tagged fake user  sources given m going change deluded user  sources given

trolling
htc plenty time straps s surprising think nt encountered problem  regardless need work quickly figure damage control   methuen  said  concern raised   well yes  tribal primary person raised concern point nt feel needs apologize raising concern  feel s different megathread would undoubtedly popped discussing  bottom line  far love strap hope s easy fix  new video good news still nt know problem solved  washing strap warm water destroys  remember told us several times get foam face headset wet remove cleaning 
nt see people trying make negative tribalinstincts  think s super upfront honest 
everyone thought detoriating  thats looked like  swet helped proccess along  swet foam creates mess  everyone woud think foam  easy bash people retrospective  das got released  get quick  people bought product  earlier review

s trolling s purely disrupt  nt think  s true believer without great deal selfawareness sense proportion  grounds ban reddit would quiet place   
anyone nt like htc valve nt automatically troll 
mass production complicated business things happen control companies resources produce every aspect product  let s assume htc approved  tested  version product issue  everybody signed ramped full scale production  still plenty places mistakes happen  could simple weather conditions uncharacteristic specific day impacted manufacturing process foam adhesive  maybe htc nt make foam instead purchases another company  perhaps company change processes machine malfunction resulting bad batch foam  s also possible company nt make adhesive chemical either  perhaps got bad batch another company  things like happen  think real question htc handles correcting mistake s customers 
looked like shedding plausible  could clearly see video top layer balling like lint  considering realistic scenario youtube video imagine much easier gauge real life tribalinstincts adamant entire foam deteriorating despite clearly enough time certain conclusion  think jumped certain facts conclusions  especially said strap  consumer ready   posted video titled  black residue coming vive audio strap   raising questions tried jump unsubstantiated drama product massive defect people would adequately informed  anyway  video good bad terms warning consumers issue 
lol  seriously thought speck monitor 
gotcha  nt feel like came jackass  genuinely curious  saw something like 36  people  least reddit  reported issue  mainly meant cost  issue nt exist  ya know 
whole layer black residue come 
oops  lol
ve owned lots headphones  6 different hmds  none foam layer flaked immediately needed washed 
sound angry  fos 
right  edited comment clear  valid counterargument 
let hold  s good people use money force manufacturers improve products 
product make back head look like raccoon  nt confidence needing wash black mystery powder use  s expect deal  money pay 
fix squeak 
microbes  hot right 
california believes
nails chalkboards mean
m calm
s adhesive holds fine velour finish failing gets wet 
yeah  leave residual water contacts plugging 3in1  vive works better conducts electricity better 
cook   salmonella 
well  fair  reasons choose rift  shitting everything else purchase makes asshole  s like ps4 vs xbone  pcmr

nope nice strawman  clearly read post history

adamant  oh please  nt act like anybody else even thought might case tried argue  obvious nt bring  obvious already know case 
ve considered 4k monitors 
well nt come across jackass nt trying hard enough  maybe cuz m huge warriors fan  p s non issue nt see
watch tribals video fine amount came  s gone forever  wash mine yes bunch shit comes  shit face  get man  defect s result manufacturing process normal  stop stubborn 
743am m starting coffee thread filled dipshits nt know talking got mindset yesterday dense adjust mindset new information  seems angry  also   m fos  s extremely common certain types foam products whatevs man  m gon na go home later enjoy shit das cuz s amazing product 
simply put  s different type foam  s uncommon certain types foam happen  let s say initial video review already tested found solution  initial video review says aware happen s good idea wash first  ll slightly less comfortable s still great product  would still impression problem product  simply result order events presented 
 wash 
even chalkboards 
s also nothing wrong choosing rift psvr vive  re enjoying games apps vr  sure  may one s objectively better product  nt mean s reason get ones 
understand think explains part andor people  people fanboys products even ve spent money nothing vested  become blind resistant criticism s product company know exists make profit  think point certainly valid think s much complicated nt think bottle things  spiritual  economic  social  one make detailed arguments whywhy  s certainly discussion another thread point simply make sense fanboyism fanboys seem like wierdos  fan something strong preference ok thing 
nt  probably wo nt   judging rest thread  would nt surprised criticizing vive thing s guilty  also nt know strawman 
end day  s 5 10 minute fix really  still think nt issue 1st place  really nt bad  pros outweigh cons 
got mine 20 minutes ago  s definitely defect  first fine velour surface  fine hairs soft  rubbed even pressure  nothing happened  got one fingerprint sized section little moist seconds later tried rubbing  time fine velour layer pilled came right section  actually tiny indentation  looks like normal porous foam underneath  came undoubtedly finish meant stay  nt sweat much vive  gon na leave rest see happens  may stubborn  m already thanks 
 wash mine yes bunch shit comes  shit face  defect s result manufacturing process normal  mean already come factory shit someone s face  certainly innovative 
 s extremely common certain types foam products go people s heads  tell  offer replacement pieces going buy gold 
would nt problem come warning says cleaned  since nt  still significant problem product  nt wash product commonly associated electronics use  going tons people buy product nt see reddit thread  youtube video  ll left bunch shit hair  people defending

tested hands deluxe audio strap accessories
""
finally proper look headstrap  need life 
htc vive officially best home virtual reality system available right 
thought guys might like see  tested generally good job hands stuff 
wonder new strap handle looking better  find current strap even lots tightening nt function well looking nearly straight  makes putt putt downfacing activities rather difficult 
still nt seen video someone trying actually aim sights vr guns  problem ran using lifelike weapon headset sticks alot gets way forced hip fire  video addressed yet  realistic looking weapon nt best idea ergonomically vr 
offering headstrap upgrade existing vives great  standard issue strap news vives  dumb buy vive knowing poor design current headstrap knowing fork yet expense replace  always viewd vive headstrap weak point compared psvr rift  dont want buy seperatly add cost already expensive device 
put  basic vive certainly nt uncomfortable  everyone different experience based magnitude issues  s subjective opinion nt stated fact  wonder norm ever figured wearing vive incorrectly 
basestations able track 16 trackers pretty awesome
nice  want ingame water bottle
vive deluxe audio strap musthave tbh
ok need price date 
loved bit  someone makes controller thumbstick instead touchpad  connect get exact functionality   yes please 
get new strap minus built headphones 
finally   waiting tested s ces videos  nice see jb mcree also 
wow  look easy put even big glasses  need  ca nt ship  like right   
 deleted 
wow convinced want new head strap 
wonder new strap replace old one newer units point 
one thing kept using vive fact already hard time breathing nose deviated septum  put headset  presses nose start sounding like darth vader  additional easy use headphones  honestly looking forward  deluxe  headstrap new tracking pucks 
ahhh want reason need  stands  s game   play  really exciting see progress re making 
welcome news  love vive ca nt spend hour vr damn thing starts hurt head  matter try adjust  always ends putting awful uneven pressure scalp  causing pain headaches  looking forward day spend hours vr forget headset even 
available without audio  ve got nice headphones like using
fact could probably buy nintendo switch price head strap going look good htc valve  ll anyway bet
using tpcast testing peripherals  bit weird nt mention suppose another video update 
anyone else disappointed went closed headphones instead open air  open air headphones provides larger sound stage better positional audio  increases immersion pivotal vr 
needone   
omg need headstrap
still many questions  trackers going sold accessories people make  tracker make accessory align game model  item tell tracker item  attach raspberry pi chair tracker pi  really dont wan na buy guys chair  common item  game 
come soon enough  htc listed store already  coming soon   come q2 
available  purchased  headband always disturbed far 
head strap looks excellent  stock one nt bad  find headset shifts fair bit look downup lot 
anyone know speakers removed  even strap better  speakers ca nt removed  sucks 
norm rules 
much love tracker  profile gets smaller ll great  guess depends weight  gloves look iffy  really want know hardware devs important feedback  resistance mechanisms gloves 
head strap priced right  m sure ll buying one  m worried re going want  199  s case  really nt want pass   m sure costs manufactures next nothing make straps  headphones nt look great  m sure d stick wireless ear headphones  also  norm switch apple watch iphone setup   nice 
new strap  50  60  ripped  absolutely reason cost 
hmm disappointed seems like track 2 total things time talks hmd wireless instead dongle attached pc 
say two connect headset  mind  arbitrary limit 16 max tracked  tracked  ridgid headstrap looks excellent  hope able use two tracked gloves gun  possible 
ending video seriously disappointing  people talking able use tracked gloves hold vive wands s possible hardware connect two peripherals one time 
looks great really disappointed hear 2 wireless tracked devices  correct  dream 2 gloves 1 gun
yeah  nt seen anybody really play like  impressed  looks perfect  also noticed norm using wireless headset playing gun end  m assuming s going get video  hopefully news good  
know s nothing official  s estimates price 
like headphones pop 
mean quarter two    use oculus rift use medium loss visual clarity frontheavy vive bouncing face outweighs wonkiness rift s tracking  whenever get hands headstrap tpcast ll using medium revive lighthouse tracking way accurate 
tested said touch months ago 
yes  oculus bite dust 
really  seeing show head strap made instant buy  rigidity really showed could hold back front stayed place  also nt notice way ear pieces popping place  pop one ear one ear like dj great want talk someone  still hear game 
definitely good job  last time tested posted prooculus video posted rvive though everyone flipped fuck said always biased towards rift  never case  norm especially fair reviewer 
 deleted 
s bit catch 22 also want thing re holding match re holding game maximize presence 
s rub  nt want true life weapon hmd gets way many gun s actual sights  instead want gun basically works many game models necessarily matches irl let s honest  nobody actually sees irl gun vr  feel grips 
m sure d like make money  s probably going included new vives  s  deluxe  label  plus  would piss everyone previously purchased vive 
s vocal subset users opted vive nt want pay included headphones rift  s understandable ve chosen keep option 
honest m bit disapointed ces  half expecte announcenemnt vive 15 added ergonomics  like headstrep headphones  new controllers like strappon prototype ve seen pictures  one hand s great existing owners left cold  hand say new buyer looking headset s bit annoying go vive buy inferior solution shell another couple hundred quid months leave dust  hand buying rift means stuck fundementally worse tracking system remedied 
problem compare rift cv1 box rift confortable  hope htc deluxe audio version closes gap 2 hmd terms ergonomics 
2 time one headset  it´s either 2 controller 1 controller 1 tracker  little bit disappointment  cant track objectives  fancy deal mouting solutions second controller 
read number arbitrary  taking info grain salt 
lighthouse track many objects physically fit tracked volume  right limit 16 objects per host could example run many hmds wanted 2 basestations limit occlusion  basestations nt actually tracking  sensors objects  basestations technically illuminating room particular way 
plus tracking significantly cheaper computationally compared camera solutions 
track  nt know much devices  emit light  16  number  comes occlusion likely
yeah nt moot headset connect 2 wirelessly 
beer
ditto  really want love touchpads wands  steam controller  simply ca nt comes sort movement  cursors configurable stuff  m  think brain ca nt get behind limited feedback using one touchpads  ve tried pretty darn hard get work well steam controller  adjusted settings modes  still perfect enough  80  time d rather thumb stick sadly 
anything fix stupid button track pad getting stuck mashed  ve gotten one fixed twice controller 
apparently removed easily 
oculus charge €59 earbuds  htc charge  25 pair face foams  nt know quality htc target headphones way complete harness  50  wait price suppose  expect crack diy version  seem get pretty good results anyway 
considering  nt specific plans replace current sku  words said nt want force people use audio solution get go  https  wwwgoogleatampuploadvrcomhtcviveaudioheadstrapriftamp  clientmsandroidgoogle  guess may simply expensive include deluxe strap  better margins old strap 
nt even replaced cable new version yet though 
never hurts head  hate look whole headset moves away face  making image blurry  also try jump  headset goes  slams back onto bridge nose  quite painful  reason nt ever jump 
yeah  maybe indepth video later may interviewed ceo tpcast present ces 2017 
that s good sign   waiting feedback  hope played taxing games  hopefully 18x ss 
could elaborate  mean larger sound stage   fwiw use bose noisereducing cans vive  love  except ouput signal seems bit quiet games   m curious know m missing 
personally   ve said elsewhere  d prefer solution similar directional speakers microsoft hololens  actually amazing   barring  d rather external audio dampened due things like fans  tv room  etc etc  houses always quiet 
yep  open air headphones perfect vr  also let hear s going outside without take headphones 
eli5  intuitively  seems since sounds comes single point  one would want little outside interference possible  ear best solution even takes variables ear shape introduce  open air better 
accessories ship fixed mounting points trackers  devs build support game certain accessories presumably accessories trackers dev purposes  buy game  one supported accessories attach separate tracker puck 
would nt surprised addition button presses etc  pogo pins used provide sort identifying info device  maybe dimensionorientation info  maybe id devs submit necessary info steam somehow pull info database  hypothesising  inside info 
seems headstrap pucks already ready production  guess early q2  probably april  honestly ca nt wait 
yep  removed  probably ca nt buy headstrap without headphones 
actually ca nt really get much smaller lighthouse based tracking  constellation tracking  angle similar measuring system matter   least want track large volumes   lighthouse engineer alan yates  aka uvk2zay   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments5m2xzjsomeleaksfromcesnewheadstrapwithintegrateddc0z152  context2      angle measuring system resolution tens hundreds microradians require 100 mm baseline get submillimetre tracking single station beyond 5 metres  fact geometry mathematics  ie  track distances 5 meters away basestation  need around 4 inches baseline tracking points device ensure amount precision accustomed 
profit 
depending quality built headphones  d say 100  would nt unreasonable  honestly m expecting closer 199   plus shipping  think re low balling asking 5060  nt think d even buy normal headphones price range build quality 99  time quite shit  re asking appears decently engineered head mount  plus decent headphone drivers top  think re dreaming bit  hey  60  would nt complain 
ve read  vive trackers communicate pc via separate usb dongles  think primary mode operation  fact also go hmd pretty cool  also  vive extra usb port maybe one could mount dongle actual hmd 
limit 16 openvr variable  valve update needed  vive hmd pair 2 controllers  extra controllers require dongle  far 1 dongle extra controller  m really hoping vive trackers properly packaged dongles sold 
 headset talk 2 peripherals pc limit  need usb dongle trackers 
headset talk two  usb dongles connecting 
think 16 devices tracked time  accept button input 2 
two received built headset  would assume vive trackers ship extra dongles like vive dk1 controllers 
yep  gets video 
yeah  looks like told held rigid relative strap great  springy arms good  provides rigidity allowing stretch one dimension help putting  similar rift  cord seems get caught interfere spring action rift   would nt able see either earlier videos  combined ratchet thing super simple 
nothing s pulled thin air essentially  people seem betting around  100 saying go much  200250 doubt since puts par tpcast terms pricing  seems totally base  best bet hope around  100  wait 
nice set headphones  large market  alone would generally  100  see lot wishful thinking  100 price point  s luxury accessory niche item pricing going reflect  htc wants make profit    150200 guess  d surprised less  edit  people nt quick start imagining unrealistic pricing  could save future irritation 
rift s optics really much better vive s  ve heard lower fov annoying  godrays   ca nt imagine metric would significantly better point  ve personally never complaints clarity vive  ve also never used rift 
vive s current headstrap definitely worst feature  good fit nt get bounce  make sure top strap long enough side straps short enough  let cup base skull rather back top head  wish could afford systems  ve curious touch controllers  look great 
sold  previous videos showed use static image mannequin head  ca nt wait hear norm s thoughts tpcast 
yeah  remember seeing one last interviews lucky started giving chaperone  could tell wanted ask norm careful questioning  toned nearly excited previous interviews oculus htc  big part tested s extra exposure last couple years vr coverage  ca nt go screwing asking lucky reddit debacle  prior trump  plus terribly professional 
biased towards rift  s question regard  s different compitent reviewer 
welding helmet mod supplies due arrive week  really ca nt wait experience 
true  think designs could modifications rear though deal headset  done still retaining style  guess s gon na take little bit manufacturers iron little details  think talked accessory makers know 
na  need s controls grip match  nt need 3  barrel sticking etc 
would think would need match really hand placement  maybe device moveable grip rod type thing match kinds games  use smg  sniper  sword etc moving grips  someone please make
would nt piss  d happy trying make product better  think would make sense dropped price current vive model make difference price  think htc try keep basic vive set better value basic rift set around 
also disturbdelay current sales updated 
means could potentially put  basic starter   like current  maybe price drop   deluxe starter  set 
 problem compare rift cv1 box rift confortable  face  nt issue vive strap mine  kind makes subjective experience pretty subjective  problem 
probably usb wireless receiver dongle  vive dk1 prototype use controllers time two vive controllers  total four  wirelessly 
 2 time one headset 2 time   headset s wireless  could sell usb wireless base station pair remaining 14 devices 
true  rep said   nt know connection points   reply  sounds unrealistic 2 devices tracked time  case trackers would ship dongles  think guy tested made assertation rep nt know real number punted question  one confirmed two device max 
guess s probably wireless connections start interfering significantly tracking starts get heavier cpu  m wondering well things integrate actual playable games  like gun hands awesome  many developers actually go program control solutions   d love see steam integrate configuration like steam controller  manufacturers upload profiles controller looks like standard button configurations let users game developers customize want 
also oculusion 
s software limit  made cause report every possible slot 16 nicer number  said soon people need 
 deleted 
steam controller usb dongle another option  remember another thread could work  problem ve heard s one dongle per tracker 
think means track 2 input buttons haptic feedback  tracker used show placement objects  16 used 
think part reason ambidextrous design wands re generally ergonomic  touchpad placement nt really work re supposed grip controller 
yeah wish could buy without less 
agree  expect  75   150 launch  luckily htc already stated  available local shops  hopefully wo nt pay crazy shipping costs 
ve seen enough people saying got new cable box think replaced tookis taking older units already channel get bought 
already replied coming another video  bad sign 
think separating items specifically htc 3rd party  expecting video specifically brought vr minute make video  nda stuff   right assuming want confuse people 
curiosity  think ss would change performance wireless link 
mean backs headphone drivers  open   think like mesh covering  rest room opposed  closed  cup style people accustomed seeing  wear closed cups effectively cut noise within room comes expense called sound stage  alternatively  open headphones hear noises within room re listening may slightly audible people room  may sound like negatives get exchange audio sounds like s created room  gaming get better positional audio often take headphones tell noise coming game real life  ie helicopter flying  water dripping  police siren   immersion key vr audio sound s right room able perceive directionaly benefits closed cups  mention something actually happening house ll hear completely closed visually audio wise  think audio version passthrough camera vive

probably hard explain  d try expensive open headphones vs closed headphones hear difference  closed headphones always sound  bit comparison  sound coming limit space comparison  d hear make sense 
conversely also break immersion

oh  s great  thought accessories would come pucks  sounds much better terms cost  accessories actually might really cheap  given ll plastic buttons

ah thanks much  settles worries 
profile sensor   ie  degree  protrudes    s main issue see puck used body tracking  also wonder array smaller sensors could  averaged  something like belt  understand sensor array rigid 
nt need submm hands extent head  current pixel densities hmds ca nt even distinguish sub millimeter tracked hands normal arms range even held pretty close 
nt get smaller stuff  hands m hoping something purposefully designed hands
nt going turtle beach quality headphones  mid range quality best  think estimating cost manufacturing headset exactly hoping make money 
hopefully small enough fit cover 
oh see  dongles need plugged hmd 
yeah realize m happy 
thanks norm 
someone flair guy 
ca nt wait 
  150  definite buy   150  il keep using default strap 
bet goes  100 still think 100 much  considering  800 product really got screwed head strap  unless headphone amazing something say reasonable price around  5080
yeah guess  100  120  feel would reasonable 
nice discount bundle headstrong tpcast m hoping  doubt ll happen hope 
na  really  playing onward nt notice difference  one smudgy god rays  one visible concentric circles  rift pupil swim annoying home unnoticable general use  rift bigger sweet spot though  want read lots text without moving head s better  neither make gauges fsx clear enough 
think may difference size eyebox  biggest problem moving around  weight bouncing around face moves eye sweet spot  god rays  rift s semirigid headstrap eyes stay sweet spot better  general comfortable  also prefer ergonomics touch  vive wands  lighthouse robust system much rather use vive anything requires precision like medium 
sweetspot bigger  return get godrays  vive still godrays  severe  get used  though  another tradeoff fov less sde  imo fov difference negligible went rift  find fov big difference 
tried  nt care rift  felt like looking camera s viewfinder due rectangular fov  nt notice increase visual quality compensate  although rift nt suffer godrays like vive  hardly notice anymore anyway 
yeah  probably would nt bother much nt headset compare  touch cool  even 3 sensors room scale set glitchy 
 interviews lucky started giving chaperone  like  luckey using steamvr s chaperone  oooh  get   
starts get bit semantics  certainly prefer rift  opinionjudgement hold  question preference natural result evaluating productexperience s merits  result existing bias towards product   bias meaning everything else equal two options would unnaturally drawn towards rift unable see equal   unfortunately term  biasbiased  gotten thrown much s almost become meaningless  like term  optimized  respect gaming performance 
 s question regard  yes  
https  youtubeebiekwa2id0  t31m1s biased towards rift  preferred comfort rift hmd available content  ca nt call bias  s preference using launch  new head strap revive makes points moot  like rift users pay third camera  us pay better head strap stinks  cost early adoption  would interested hear stand platforms features parity  guess prefer touch controller design  like vive tracking pretty much everything else vive offers  giving pretty large edge right

nt face shapes s subjective either  also clear objective reasons reviewers people  included  almost unanimous rift comfortable  easier   friction pivots temples lets take pressure cheeks transfer brow  helps  lot   plus setting pitch angle helps get good sweet spot instead stuck angle happens clamp face  weight difference noticeable  plus structured harness means rift put low tension stay place  keep vive secure similar vigorous movement requires  lot  tension makes considerable difference comfort  going true regardless face shape  tout convenience headphones right ve never subscribed  never much bothered putting vive buds harness rigged handy  vive s clear advantages  deluxe strap looks like directly address couple key weaknesses  wo nt fully bridge gap  due weight  looks like might get way ll definitely buyer unless price crazy 
everyone comes tries  confort always superior rift  ever order use hmds  opinion 
m hoping happen  ll need official thing like devs really support  
836min says exactly  nt know dongle
steamvr limited 16 tracked objects  basestations  4 pcs one room could 64 objects tracked 2 basestations one valve guys literally said limit arbitrary talk  forget one  may gdc   said someone needs 16 bump number 
dev h3vr already mention integration tracked guns  gloves probably retrofitted games like gallery  glovecontroller combo maybe  would nt expect gloves widely retrofitted current games 
occlusion still happens frequency  advantages processing  precision  distance 
course occlusion  s optical tracking 
seriously  see question coming  perhaps answer nt finalized  one dongle per tracker might work better solution coming 
announced dongle 
yeah  2 used conjunction headset  probably data transfer purposes   rest trackers nt transferring data positional data via blue tooth  m pretty sure done link box  edit  talk usb dongle tracking  nt seen info 
ah makes sense  thanks 
better spt m using touch controls  fit way every time  point shooting much easier 
yeah  probably wo nt get already set overear headphones incredibly comfortable exact audio quality want  nt want pay onear headphones inevitably inferior sound quality wo nt ever use get better strap 
ah  s good news guess 
something compression video feed
something compression video feed
interesting  thanks 
thanks reply 
well probably way controllers  gyros positioning lighthouses  way understand trackers hardware controllers  pin port interface peripherals  matter dev preprogramming profile  use random stuff id imagine game would need take calibration process  slightly bummed vives wireless pairing 2 device limit  first saw things thought would perfect mapping leg movement  wonder add usb dongle expand number devices  increase via firmware 
 nt need submm hands extent head  depends use case  nt  based demos ces think valvehtc envision used lot gaming applications  built device accommodate high level precision large tracking space wide variety scenarios  even people cant distinguish level precision could still useful  point suppose someone could develop smaller tracker s less precise distance wanted  nt know stringent valve s lighthouse standards 
sits wrist  nt seem issue imo
end day  nt really care  buying anyway  without knowing specifics already expecting 199   mentioned   cheaper  great  probably wo nt though 
 usb work fine plugged pc   although run vive another room usb hub extension cord might advised   currently people already mixed reality attaching 3rd vive wand camera flashing steam controller usb dongle new firmware make pair vive wand  would ideal vive trackers simply shipped usb dongles like  htc needs get manufacturing process valve  load firmware vive instead steam controller start  slap vive branding instead steam branding 
 deleted 
thinking anything  200 immediate purchase  hearing people suggest could low  100 drooling 
would feel kinda bad asked 100 fix shitty ergonomics original headset lol
get pupil swim s sitting angled low enough head  chatting someone onward says hates fact ca nt lie clearly shoot vive peripheral nt clear enough  rift better respect quite useable lying
oh see mean  yeah move around due weight  although ve vive long nt notice anymore  strap baby tight  although ll probably start noticing get hands sexy new strap 
get within foot grid pops know hit 
d much rather get incremental add upgrades whole unit upgrades every year  headstrap  controller  etc way easier stomach vive 20 better headstrap  controller  screen  lenses  base stations  wireless  etc   maybe s 
preferred touch released 
yes  gloss major differences like fov  screen brightness  tracking solution dismissing saying unnoticeable untrue  notice things everytime use  things tested nt properly  end focus mainly subjective issue comfort say oculus better  especially annoying personally find rift way less comfortable vive 
oculus vs vive review good example  said oculus better based subjective opinion even though tech vive objectively better  failed throughly test equipment stopped using vive together  would nt play newer content like google earth required motion controlers nt available rift recently  m saying s bad like one  affecting response 
 nothing ve seen tested seems prooculus https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vc7ijwo7quk go 
yeah ve already watched video s entirety anticipation  although m going go  variant   https  reddit5b5spw  without 3d printed pieces 
point made assertation rep rep said nt know  norm know limits  suspect nt  want hear htc valve person  youtube celebrity talks circles around reps 
worth noting also still need ways trackers communicate pass positional data pc  headset talk 2 trackers time  usually controllers    want track 1 object addition controllers need least 1 usb dongle  wonder limit dongles might  like  add 2 tracking pucks feet one dongle  need 2 dongles communicate  want go arcade track 16 objects  many dongles need 
hope job simulator gets retrofitted gloves  even ca nt feel anything   know already modified ingame hands separate fingers oculus react rough finger positions 
tend trust yates knows s talking  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments5m8hlnmoredetailsaboutthevivetrackerscanhaveup
ca nt see replacing strap unless actual officially new bundle though  getting old cable re neighbour gets new one irritation  getting old strap neighbour gets new ripoff 
d possibly want tracked pen  current bulk probably nt going work well  ca nt think many realistic consumer use cases  m sure may one 
 means freedom movement nice builtin headphones  ll gladly take price  buy wireless addon come 
 would ideal vive trackers simply shipped usb dongles like  actually hindsight would great breakout box headset could pair devices  limit two seems arbitrary steamvr 16 limit  considering case  expect see limit disapearing potential vive 2 hardware  s least 2018 away 
hope right  remember seeming inflation htc items like extra viimote lighthouse 
idk  150200 kinda iffy  like current wireless headset  astro a50s ftw  built sound  nice would use  huge plus mainly want ridged body strap  actualy vive set fairly comfortable longer time use  would love better  really want strap  much use mine  current setup  s somthing extreamly worried 
s 25  cost headset  seems ridiculously high  s plastic strap  new wand lighthouse  s  150 someone else probably release cheaper copy 
despite trying solutions subreddit  fiddling around  ca nt seem fully get pressure cheek bones  cheap fix would major boon  heck  nt care headphones  want ergonomics fixed 
wo nt send cheap fix though  surely aim make profit   100 range seems realistic 
lie see fine  wear glasses might add swim rift 
price htcs parts would probably much cheaper buy vive 2 sell bits nt need 
ok thanks response  ll check keep mind  norm always seemed pretty pumped vive guess nt watched oculus stuff 
s right  need clarification 
guys talking two different things though  norm said system track 16 objects referred presumably another valve employee told number  end though  talking many devices hmd connect  many objects lighthouse  beacon norm called  track  edit  read trackers communicate directly pc via wireless dongle irrelevant 
think said 1 tracker per dongle  d like know daisy chain trackers usb connection one communicate pc via dongle  also presumably able use trackers wired directly pc  would good stuff nt move like desk keyboard 
d great  ooh  rick morty game  already uses  gloves 
nice  thanks
imagine surgery simulators might require higher level precision 
bought extra light house  nt come mounting kit  screws  pretty lame imo 
items normally part bundle  though  always assumed inflated sold individually  would assume brand new item would nt inflation 
agreed  ve worn vive 3 hours time feels fine  s pillowsonmyface comfortable  s fine  however  rigidity means nt move much face m spinning around like lunatic  could offer tangible benefit  even  unless comes   150  nt think s worth  honestly think vive bite bullet make standard strap ships vive  s clearly better experience going forward 
builtin audio definitely biggest plus nt wireless solution  even dedicated audio solution  ve moving gaming headset desktop pc vive whenever need  hassle combined cable flopping around number times friends tried take hmd taking headphones make musthave  rigid strap apparent overall quality added bonus makes willing buy dayone opposed waiting reviews 
mention better a50 mic  vives default mic makes everyone sound like diabetic darth vader 
mean  s plastic strap   pair headphones  plus  every indication thus far s pretty high quality  granted  m likely willing blow money  reducing  plastic strap  pretty disingenuous  regardless  m commenting less think cost   personally  willing pay 
ah possibly  yeah might push headset bit far away
m curious see price gen2 hmd standalone  assuming stick modular approach offer option  right  uk prices  subtract separately available components  besides face foam nose rest  assume d come hmd probably crossgen compatible   re left £21806  759  course d price  individual components certainly markup relative bundle  ll interesting see shakes end 
even could nt daisy chain trackers directly together  would likely possible use usb hub  re going sending much data 
sure consumer use alien surgeon simulator 
 seems unlikely  since named thing deluxe audio strap  seem want present premium extra  maybe point ll sell headphones separately start shipping new vives strap sans headphones  ca nt see without major official revision though  smaller box  new wrist straps  even new 3in1 cable iterative improvements  suddenly stuck new strap anyone bought one got old strap headstrap lottery  would seriously ticked 
yea  150 less  im buying day one 
good point  forgot headphones  given oculus sells ear buds  70 afair  guess  150 
iirc run 127 devices one usb port  wonder would really work many hubs would need 
heh  re right  soon vr surgeon training definitely thing  may able use commercial vr hardware though 
perhaps oftrumoured vive 15  lighter design  courtesy newer  simpler tracking sensors   could also include new strap 
yeah agree  avoid ticking people would need give new name  dare say  discount vive 10
make better dongle really  ca nt see need one per tracker  certainly hope s case  seems silly many dongles 
believe read somewhere  nt recall source  sorry   current transceiver use support 1 device time  two usb hub inside hmd  essentially  company makes chips use nextgen version works support several devices  hopefully ready time trackers launch ll able one receiver  fits cover vive hopefully  connect several trackers 
hope true  nt even sit hmd  mean  reality  nt matter much consumers anyway  ca nt see people lots home  ideally d need one peripherals come mounting points nt need buy trackers  even end 2 3  s still lot dongles   
see 3 easily enough  two gloves rifle maybe   sure  onehanded items could probably use standard controllers  m sure cleverer people already thinking compelling uses 
s shame nt think ahead add transceivers least extra usb port link box 
poll  htc vive owners  deluxe audio strap

got vive couple weeks ago quickly added deluxe headstrap  inear buds inconvenient  falling ears heavy action games real pain removing  putting headset  wish  50 instead  100 though  point  really shipping base units default 
hesitant purchase high price bought delux audio strap month ago  best investment vr date 
 love  unadvertised benefit gets smaller original strap  kids use vive without stuffed animal jammed behind heads 
bought mine 2 months ago year owning vive  consider absolute necessity ’ grown  dislike  using vive   ’ something use quite often 
nope   100 much spend change something s never bothered

strap makes easy put take  switching person person made simple original strap  messing head phone wires  audio acceptable  although personally prefer audio earphones  live convenience  comfort improved  inexplicably  still prone headache type discomfort prolonged usage  regretfully ca nt give unequivocal recommendation 
one  boy s worth  
nope prefer using headphones probably far better anyway
personally  strap headphones united item  kept purchasing  want use wireless headset like ear headphones  better mic  simplicity using 1 device pcvive  wanted strap  would problem paying  4050  90 d take headphones would waste  idk many people thought  still think sold strap alone earphones optional addon  whatever increased cost  s something least 1 customer   drew line 
yes nt know would buy  thought speakers would good enough  nt  m hardcore audiophile several   100 headphones ones attached das nt cut  remove  s worse headphones used das  sennheiser 598  nt fit das  far comfort goes  s better still nt great 
yep  got one  original strap wasis really bad  vive still pretty heavy  deluxe strap makes least comfortable  also less cords tangle  putting additional headphones pain 
honest always amazed since got announced always fence buying cost  fortunately got try one yesterday sold  looot comfy  least  longer  falling inears  problem solved   tried headphones heavyimpractical imo

purchased das vive day  extra headphones top headset sounded way bulky  built makes miles faster slip  need since girlfriend constantly switching back forth  afford das 100  worth  opinion 
71 surround vr room works good  sub adds lot immersion imo
poll would better titled   poll  htc vive owners hardcore enough regulars  average  rvive subreddit  deluxe audio strap  
nope  nt need one want one  ve already got headphones  nt need pointless accessories 
yes  worth every penny  wouldnt build anything vive rift right  get position  learn stuff  dont commit anything gen 2 era right first mover advantage  time  lot profit today  maybe unlimited riches tomorrow 
 inear buds inconvenient  falling ears heavy action games real pain removing  putting headset   routing front   http  iimgurcombvo9u5ojpg  fixes problem 
use ear headphones  deluxe headstrap needed 
never fell ear mate
interesting  usually go rolled toddler size shirt hand towel  try stuffed animal 
yep  3yo wear without constantly hold playing  s also easy enough adjust  velcro straps sucked  separated strap glue back 
exactly  use vive strap  need include default new headsets  imo 
turned vive virtual reality helmet  s awesome 
felt way audio side  comfort aspect  s major improvement 
s like vr general  try  want  nt tried  re wondering big deal 
 around corner  mhmm know s least dozen comics written people wo nt buy newest tech something newer 
 pimax 8k way  d rather spend cash better headset happens lighter comfortable well 
nope  built product right first time  guess s much ask constantly breaking trackpads controllers extremely uncomfortable default strap  want  100  lol 
perfect summary  thx 
overear phones removable  like sound isolation buds 
kind headache  could caused either additional neck strain pressure temples hmd ve got quite tight 
half benefit das nt even audio 
bought first thing remove audio part  use headphones mic das much better head mounting system  looking ground much comfortable 
tried bose quiet comfort headphones vive  easily startled people think funny come grab wonder got hit face
m boat  headphones ear buds came vive  fine enough quality sound  considered das really needing pair headphones seemed like lot money  m dev  spend lot time popping vr  quite often nt need want headphones  non integrated great  wish could get stable strap  really quite fine one exists  fine enough spend entire workdays vive  
re getting disproportionate sample polling people active device s subreddit
would accessory d use time  one two games  think something usable lots games like really good rifle something solves one core problems vive  like cable management typing vr 
s much much lower  65 percent people
poll numbers meaningless  people nt interested strap wo nt interested coming thread voting 
das without headphones half price  s d like buy 
la  ny london dominate map  interesting indeed 
welder mask mod comfortable das  needed audio something looks good business demos 
oculus afford s different scenario  htc sell people willing buy  profits means financial issues  one reasons could see launching vive 2 next year getting market totally  anything could happen point 
das headgear stability comfort audio imo
 needed audio needed something looks sleek business demos 
yes  detach torx screwdriver 
really need 8700k  would nt think cpu much bottleneck  6700k would leave room save gtx 1080 
actually   point poll estimate das market penetration 
3000 participants  almost 50  50 split 
headphones surprised   re shabby 
maybe try das  lots ways adjust everything fits comfortable  takes little time 
oh  sorry  ve adblock installed since early 2000 s  nt aware ads 
nt touched vive guess m hardcore  m also regular rvive  yet still saw pop front page  think original title accurate

still suck compared headphones  especially multiple people playing  one going want stick ear wax buds ear someone else  also  got severe shock mine kneeling ground 
get roll sticky backed velcro  cut two squares spiky side stick backtoback  velcro fuzzy part strap  pull strap tighter normally allow  velcro closed  make sense  used kids got das  worked perfectly 
pull velcro strap way around back head  cables thread back  holds fine kids

yep  slip  slip  adjustments  making sure velcro nt going come flying midplay 
sounds  hot  put fans 
feel like helmet s really awesome 
understand mean  really taking life advice people deviantart 
remember saying vive  around corner  back mid2015   least actually hardware play right  s hell lot easier wait back 
realize vive released year half today  right  nowadays  new tech lasts one two years buying vive right would pretty fucking stupid idea  waiting months  one would gain benefit choosing less expensive vive 1 expensive better vive 2   whatever s name  s also important keep mind lot second hand vive 1s pop announcement vive 2 suggesting  buying brand new vive right  maybe months new one released   something newer anyway   buying new product near end s life never good idea 
eh  personal experience default strap comfortable none controllers issues ve vive since launch  new das comfortable  hardly requirement  m commenting often s problem cases hear none content happy customers 
agree point  early adopters deal shit  unfortunately  m willing put first gen 
since launch zero problems 
pretty simple look guys attempt edge lord status shows s instill thoughts minds willing accept 
idea re getting downvoted  guess confort strap subjective  personally like  trackpad issues known recurring  personally send controllers back rma two times   even three consider  sending back immediately received s still broken  full rma procedure  
anecdotal  m wave 1 preorder nt issues mine  strap nt perfect nt enough issues want spend get deluxe strap  anything people negative experiences speak louder often issues 
pretty much  headphone secured headset one little screw 
could shape forehead combined 11mm aftermarket padding  causing pressure points temples  instead distributed evenly  s difficult sure  feels like blood restricted  ve even felt numbness  looser headset fall forward  sessions better others  m thinking custom made pad could fix  nt want return original increased fov 
true enough  dial adjustment fantastic 
headphones nt great honestly
nt know m willing drop  100 look floor
use k7xx re open back still hear people
35 s  incredible head phones perfect vr
wireless wired ones  also much feel helps immersion  fence buying 
plus self selection bias  people got audio strap might stronger desire respond question someone  nt  buy accessory     sbbook 
posted poll communities well  yes  course bias 
nt address problem polling subreddit  might useful integrate poll including larger range viverelated questions remove selfselection bias 
audio deinitely biggest factor love deluxe audio strap  s huge bonus turn head sideways comfortably helmet 
ahhh yeah  welder mod pretty  haha  effective

 waiting months getting information  think would little shortsighted assume vr going follow release cycles tech stage s life  know  s probably likely  vive 2 could another year  really nt know s end s life  would nt say buying vive today  pretty fucking stupid idea  
 m quite happy vive launch preorder  nt issue  strap perfect deal without thinking play  thus nt try deluxe see much difference  would much pay 100150€ get wireless deluxe strap  much tpcast asking  would willing buy new hmd s wireless  higher resolution comfortable vive  trigger price would less vive launch  near 1000€  spec  update impressive coming flat gaming vr  would say pay 500700€ depending much improvement vive 
yep  issues strap good set headphones means ive never even thought improving audio 
try velour 10mm face pad vrcover  got mine week trying several others s comfortable far
like still allow hear s going around little bit 
would vastly prefer das could unclip headphones use 
half benefit das nt even audio 
s part  s better fit whole time re wearing  obviously s luxury something already luxury  thankfully  money nt tight  picked love 
q701s  basically build  could nt get fit hmd  might big head 
re probably going break unless drive properly  hope dedicated headphone amp  vr use d suggest pair k77s  re cheap enough sound great without amp 
noise cancellation improve immersion compared beforehand 
bluetooth cable  mine 35s immersion think surround sound might better  terms keeping noises stuff life great  really hear game unless quiet part dogs bark
ve never issues movement wearing headphones  re small  guess fit well 
well  nt really intended take  want  pretty easily 
static shock  harmless humans kill headset  people feel shocks need take socks  change shoes  etc  northern hemisphere heads winter  lots   discover

typical  audiophile  moron
well  least eliminate audio environment room  see would nt help 
ah cable still used 35s  one problems nt sure whether d get 25s lose bluetooth  makes sense noise cancelling improve immersion whatever  may sde still pronounced  pulling  struggle sde preventing immersed   sound plays less role think point become weakest link noise cancellation become big factor  thx 
got  thought meant severe  damaging  rather  painful   context  static makes sense though

aus  much  love   http  iimgurcomwyhq44vjpg   htc
much better quality life almost every area  nt feel bad  
 s preorder  meaning s yet  reviews yet either 
tested youtube videos saying s great
re brief showing ces e3  nt remember  like idea worn similar holoens s strap nt mind current strap much s  100 d rather spend vr games  seems like minor upgrade  maybe people wear 12 hours day run vr arcades makes sense probably 
mean  ca nt worse regular straps  
june 5th
read comment remembered  100 coupon  ordered 
time start return  also  pay  100 mouse 
nt cancel order intention using code something else  made mistake ms support told go f  coupon longer valid ca nt replaced  actively avoiding purchasing anything bs 
yw   
look closed back similar style sennheiser hd25 s  idea sound quality though  would nice hd25 s could swapped nt decent drivers 
re closed back cans  sound wo nt impressive  probably quality usual  gamer  headphones  completely terrible pair sennheisers whatnot wo nt comparable 
m guessing price wo nt come new cable  picture looks like little cable latch side wide enough accommodate oldstyle cable  course  waiting reviews things wild still best option 
works fine original cable per articlesphotos ve seen previously posted  far know nt come cable  s headset strap 
think free shipping htc really doubtful 
confirmed fit tpcast 
 tpcast  ve already seen images people using tpcast new audio headstrap together   https  wwwvrheadscomsitesvrheadscomfilesstylesxlargewmbrwpublicfieldimage201701tpcastdeluxecombojpg  also  tpcast   basically htc s official solution  tpcast developed inside htc s vivex accelerator program 
yes
canada think 
strap offers comfort easier fit  s  rigid  frame tighten fit head twisting knob back  nt tried  early testers said significantly reduced front weight headset 
s comfort improvements making vive rest base skull similar rift 
nt think  nt  find vive headstrap pretty comfortable  claiming   comfortable  built audio instead needing extra headphones top  s money m willing spend improve experience slightly 
s mainly comfort thing  original strap works well enough  step  easier adjust  also built audio speakers make one less thing worry 
guess took  hell  10000 microsoft gift card  
usa  ordered phone  problems 
likely blacklisted verisign similar company  could device network spamming several sites monitored verisign 
s suppose shipping headset either way ll buy deluxe strap separately 
know  wo nt appreciate nice new straps nt original ones year  wait turn 
would get vive first  see much dislike  throw  100 problem might exist 
hope audio quality good   d gladly pay 100 bucks  ve using apple earpods vive 
decent headphones cost  50 audio quality good d say s worth  made one construction helmet things sucks honestly d happily pay bit extra professionally made strap replacement
welcome early adoption 
headphones probably big part price  also  think price known quite time
glad nt 200 dollars

hype  really  3 leaks retailers  microsoft store  alternatede amazon  think ll see hype actual htc announcement e3 draws closer couple weeks 
fair  prototypes nt spend long wearing  want know s big enough  audio decent enough  allows 3 hour gaming session without becoming uncomfortable  etc 
mention ll buying gen2 regardless  might xmas earlymid next year  strap months  100 nt really worth  maybe thinking keeping vive couple years  gen1 quickly becoming obsolete 
came vive purchase microsoft store black friday last year 
unless sold version headphone jacks clips still  might avoid tool separate mold another sku store  sure  m looking forward built audio personally 
audio removable anyways 
fresh elastic straps fine  also appreciate new strap upgrade getting used elastic  play vr anywhere near much  re going get eventually  messing headphones annoying part getting setup 
na  headset fine comfort  end using lot improvement 
s comfort audio quality   250 sennheiser momentum ii headphones d much rather  even means lower sound quality removes hassle putting headphones every time taking 
format pretty common computery context  especially filenames like  ensures nt program smart sorting want everything order date   much humanread contexts  though 
programmers dbas love 
handled vive preorders htc s website kind shit show  people getting turned online payments losing place line etc  original payment declined particular reason  time resubmitted payment got process started got weeks later expected  spent looooooong time phones chat support htc well  huge pain ass 
also  preorder cancelled  manually automatically due failed charging  would nt move people queue closer front  instead opened spot next person put order  meant people ordered release received vive earlier people preordered first day

oh want wait reviews audio  s main selling point  audio bad wont buy
seems really weird  would many companies give aussies shaft  call aussies  think s thing  guess ve always assumed high prices kind import tax imposed australia  s weird think conspiracy companies dicks 
nt think  nt actually asked 
know  also know written alternate website says friday
ordered  dunno  nt use vive much anymore maybe hoping use comfortable headset  p anyway  one reply mails order basically says  delivery date unknown  
indeed  tough luck 
http  iimgurcom8ifcjc7png says  verfügbar   normally done really stock  otherwise would say something like  im zulauf  oder simply  nicht verfügbar  something 
see many left stock purchase one  since someone able buy  still shows  available   seems inaccurate 
looks like legit retailer yes  shipping date certainly mistake  german  could send mail ask chance 
seems indeed mistake  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments67uk5ddeluxeaudiostrapavailablegermanyaustriadgtdpxs
please nt get wrong  noone actually expects miracle  fairness  delivery according demand rather country reasonable pricing delivery  would enough 
smart man  well said 
well  logistic structures europe us pretty similar  multimedia devices gaming hardware usually sells much europe states  blatantly different markets indeed 
unfortunately coming soon  really informative 
doubt much going change units
pretty sure system modular expectations upgrading hmd another  vive v2   ll able use lighthouses  controllers  head strap  etc 
would surprised gen2 nt come something like considering biggest competitor 
ah  nice  congrats audio strap  let us know 
well surely would cheaper without headphones  think enough people prefer higher quality headphones 
gotcha  thank information  m super excited finally vive 
fair  largely depends sizeshape persons head  glasses  ears  etc  find vive heavy uncomfortable hour playtime  really hope new headstraps fix large enough pumpkinheads like

preorder microsoft  return nt fit without paying shipping restocking fees 
nope  re fucked never penalty  thing even close adobe sued  inquiry   couple years ago charging different amounts australians digital product 
get shafted companies get away  right dawn war iii  70 steam  s 70 usd  93 aud 
save trouble  asked harvey norman tried sell whole vive  told already one like  ca nt buy things individually  lol  asked jbhifi kept trying sell gear vr 
yeah  gathered threads fact stock  probably shop nt correct  pre order  tag used generic  available  tag  someone pointed something really stock  shown  stock   available   also hope comfortable headset  would really like official strap  welder masks  mechanisms  one fits completely without letting light sides still able flip without mess straps  try use headset camera peeking  start losing tracking interference issues htc recommend turning cam happens  would stil like able peek around times 
called said already got small stock headstraps available  many people ordered one  people may wait 2nd shipment arrive may  said everyone ordering one still able get may  need wait june 
sad hear  also expected  least know price eu countries 
interesting  completely  ignored asia market bigger damn things produced  easier ship case miss point   also   logistic structures europe nt necessarily similar us shipping selling   us way easier since s single country many states  europe compromised many different countries  lawslanguages    much   variance populations  nt know get  sells much europe  us  maybe gaming general much different  gon na need source  
gives us hope  put placeholders right next controllers new 3 1 cables  s
imagine gen2 headstrap nice  need preemptively buy one  even modular d surprised new headset bought without strap  htc knows make money  nt remotely generous  wo nt future 
probably margins small terms packaging  assembly  marketing  etc makes sense sell want remove headphones  price without headphones would bucks people would say screw get backups small price difference 
one thing forgot mention new strap help protect 3in1 cable much better  oem strap allow tension damage cable re careful  replace mine  covered rma  still sucked 
wear strap  also new vives lighter rift launch 
yeah hindsight 2020  supposed know credit card orders would issues paypal would go fine  anything paypal seemed less reliable adds another opportunity failure mix 
nothing banks working flawlessly  ve ordered things online since time time online ordering thing  never order marked potential fraud whatever blocked 
yeah s shame really  stuff buy online  get stuff maplins s still limited compared stuff get across way  entire build basically bought amazon assemble  reliable option ebuyer  currys tried sell 960 cost 980ti 
need ask yet  however  re missing point  go hn jb proper computer stores stock  d trust know bit vr 
thanks heads  really appreciated 
alternate strikes  thing happened custom 1080 models release  oh well  back waiting line guess  thanks nonetheless 
m ignoring asian market  nt like talk countries profund knowledge  regarding knowledge  nt seem understand european union works  see  terms trade market  eu basically one big country different conumer taxes  like us  yes  talking gaming general  since seem real comparable selling numbers net specific item vive  s perfectly legit assume general numbers concerning hardware sells valid device well  actually  d one prove hypothesis wrong numbers  
indeed 
ca nt  top strap maximum length s barely enough  launch vive s pretty heavy way sits head

mic  even vive mic  looks like m waiting  damn 
hope fix micno camera thing 
mic huge con  hope fix sort software update unacceptable  whole reason considered tpcast multiplayer  also wo nt bluetooth mic require add bluetooth card pc  motherboard nt bluetooth  hassle 
lack mic quite sad  one could replace clipon bluetooth mic  would also benefit increasing mic quality  honestly htc  would put mic directly infront nose  audio strap agree completely  also got mine form alternate amazing  really come vives   though  im using mine 6mm vrcover  get light leakage original foams  also find 6mm bit comfortable  downside move lens 23  snaps   gets close get amazing fov  also fisheye distortions  swap originals need demo someone glasses 
man  hearing tpcast months first ve heard vive mic disabled  sure desk mic behind desk turned hear d hear ac  fan  tv  dishwasher  etc  nobody wants hear shit  getting bluetooth mic wireless mic clip onto opposite tpcast das meant  slim simplify everything  nt want yet another device worry pairing correctly recharging  hoping setup would eliminate wires  consolidate audio headset eliminate wire  make use concealed mic already  m passing tpcast certain version 20 competitor s version either make use mic include way  s big issue never address 
thanks input  re saying re comfortable 3hr das vive session rift  considering trying get hands light vive revision makes wearable hours end m  also switch covers necessity comfort 
know get audio strap  news release tpcast 
  mic camera currently available omfg  6 months ve dreaming finally able buy one  news kills stone dead 
ha  meatspace   s new go word   ifs buts  m getting damn cost  use mic elite set separate headphones use vastly superior mic front desk 
 ergonomically prefer das rift headstrap  s difference makes better 
mic pretty disappointing  would expect fixed though  know usb port headset still works 
thanks write time  looking forward  super disappointed tpcast mic  hope update software add add adjustments make us fcc 
s unfortunate lack mic camera  played arizona sunshine horde mode weekend felt like heavy tail attached back head 
dang said nt let mic work  nt care much camera  mic absolute must games play 
borrow 
thank much feedback  m looking forward audio strap  nt realize mic would nt work tp cast  m likely going pass reason  nt want switching wire whenever want play something multiplayer 
thx great review  seems like das nobrainer  mic sadly nogo personally vr  probably ll pass tpcast 
tpcast repositioned  use separate headset nt ll able use receiver sit right middle strap given s head band lives 
question  could send tpcast   p great update  thanks keeping us posted  issues setting router tpcast  main  router room 
 switched back vrcover 6mm pad original wide face pad combined vrcover cotton fabric focused properly adjusting top strap underneath tpcast  adjusted properly brings vive hmd almost parity lighter rift  prefer original wide foam conjunction das  s better using das 6mm vrcover 
could nt get headset mic connects 35 mm audio jack hmd  would work 
people loose already vr  tpcast going see large influx youtube wall huggers
thanks update  find batteries work sure please let us know  know pack one connectors half tall 
great review  thanks  mic camera working  mean vive s orientation transmitted wireless  contrllers  assumed usb  case tpcast would kind packet filtering  come think  makes sense  usb likely latent custom 24ghz protocol came controllers 
mic cam  damn kills
know wifi portion tpcast 24 5 bands  configured specific channels  m wondering potential performance impact urban congested areas  usually​ many wifi networks around m sure work properly 
microphone bummer  especially multiplayer titles arise longer motivation curve therefore actually 24h population  hopefully firmware thing updated  tempted buy tpcast well  first reviews  meh  cable bothering equivalent 250 euros   kind getting wireless train vr freedom city 
well  least means ll upgrading mediocre mic something good  anyone recommend wireless mic  nt want wireless headset  ll using das  lots wireless gaming headsets nt see many options mic 
please estimate minimummaximum diameter circumference das please 
 rotated bei 180 degrees german detected
tell us specific model anker battery please  models look nearly identical different spec  typically different max charge  recharge currents due different versions quickcharge iq tech  guess probably either https  wwwankercomproductsa1271012 https  wwwankercomproductsa1272011 wonder smaller ones suitable  https  wwwankercomproductsa1215011 https  wwwankercomproductsa1214011
say camera  include chaperone s roomview option  even  want  hm  birthday nt far away  might get little something 
thank information regarding tpcast  would also possible talk proposed heat shield make one  decided buy revolve headstrap instead deluxe audio strap  think ll needing use heat shield tpcast protect  revolve  going soft due material ll made 
thanks review  sounds awesome  mic cam acceptable tradeoffs first wireless addon imho 
camera chaperone bounds based camera  well sucks
tpcast waa already pricey find cant use mic   play pavlov without mic teamplay nonexistent  im gon na pass tpcast
hey das buy tpcast  m nz trouble sourcing get  cheers 
already nt use vive s builtin microphone favor desk microphone  losing camera s total dealbreaker  love camera view available  guess wo nt going wireless soon thought 
til vive builtin camera haha
wow  theres lot no mic cam  go    get wireless headset  camera  seriously  guys even use  novelty wore first week  flat ouf disabled  fuck honestly need  like rl friends   cries softly  seriously  use cam 
guys mic  use desktop mic easy cheap 
tldr 
nope  usb data transmitted wirelessly positional information hmd controllers  s shame  ca nt imagine data vive s mic would much transmit quite easily 
considering 98  time vive social  multiplayer games  way would consider buying wireless adapter prevents speaking  great would go wireless  yank cord pretty much day  without microphone  m going wait one 
yeah  big deal  m using mic probably 80  time m vr 
totally went past vive mic  blunt ask  use ear headset mic noticed  espiecially want look etc big earphones start move around quite bit due gravity  would like give vive ones shot would need know get vive integrated mic working   iphone  kind thing ear phones microphone embedded cable 
would fairly easy use 1020  wireless mic attached vive somewhere  think 
100  sure ca nt turned  sure op knows sure disabled wireless  anyone else tp cast tell us ve gone support figure sure 
yeah camera s dealbreaker  consider among best reasons pick vive rift 
anyone know could done via firmware  must sending data across already headset s orientation  surely could include mic audio 
remember add bluetooth via usb  need open things add card  tiny little plugin  size logitech receiver 
usb bluetooth dongles  hehehe  dongles 
would say get excess stock strap find start shipping hmd
 m passing tpcast certain version 20 competitor s version either make use mic include way  s big issue never address  wont see market next 24 months   passing wireless  purely ca nt get mic work 
comparing like like  combination tpcast das makes comfortable extended gaming session rift  applies rather larger playspace  3mx4m  3 sensor rift setup  ymmv
wait  getting audio strap 
s rigid together twisting knot mechanism easy take 
assume provide current s  usb based communication pc beyond tracking data 
money  could get wireless headset 
d tilt headset s strap forward little  would work fine  considering transmission needs line sight  d imagine top head mandatory 
yep  room  issues setting 
headshape least  prefer original padding  yes  allows comfortably tighten das knob back  achieving high lateral stability without hmd pressed face much 
audio jack  unfortunately  usable audio output  microphones nt work using connector 
use vive usb port get mic input  tpcast using slot 
even  still transmit data pc  apparently 
bluetooth headset option
never problem  like actually 
  explain last sentence 
normally transmitted via usb  link  positional data  emulated tpcast using 24ghz router connected pc  thos stream  however  consist said tracking data nt offer camera microphone functionality 
s actually likely running around 60ghz  24 5 would simply able send much data fast  downfall 60ghz weak barely penatrate small door  however  seem using advantage stray signals would bounce walls come back hit receiver  regards question  wo nt heavily congested bands even people running 60ghz bands  would able travel far enough interfere 
ll measure min max diameter get home tonight trust math skills get corresponding max min circumferences  
 indeed
ordered https  wwwankercomproductsa1271012 one specified chinese sources  ordered another one backup ordered https  wwwankercomproductsa1215011 try see would work shorter sessions  anecdotally  looks lot like renders smaller battery tpcast s website 
means camera nt physically connected pc  course still get chaperone bounds  camera overlay anymore 
honestly  m thinking 2 layers tinfoil  thin paddingfoam another 2 layers tinfoil  sort tinfoilpaddingtinfoil sandwich  glue underside tpcast fine 
chaperone bounds based camera
think means  tron  camera active see room vive headset 
chaperone function light houses  think camera issue pretty minor  mic hand 
chinese version  wait reviews ones coming west 
deluxe audio strap  widely available june 6th   100  tpcast ordered china right  services ship fee op likely went 
find camera quite useful trying find drink quickly look around room without taking headset  handy indeed 
never looked front vive  lol
locating beer 
easily locate control tengafleshlight without removing vive requires  plus smearing hmd well lubricated fingers 
finding keyboard  controller  drink  seeing s someone room  etc
stepping cat 
use camera daily  usually find drink item desk see cat m playing 
would use occasional avoid killing cat  camera function stopped working never bothered troubleshoot  warned cat stay away vr  camera deal breaker seems like wireless mic plausible solution comms  everyone needs remember edge development early adopters  either choose support hopefully enjoy advances come  
sound bad way  hate people  thing frustrating people leave audio mirror transmit everything played tv back mic  echo echo echo  games force games heavy communication  maybe sound check speaking playing mirrored device  transmits back mic  audio mirror gets shut 
bad enough people hear burp  listen fart
 deleted 
mic 
holy crap seen  go onward  rec room many popular titles 
yeah mic nt much bandwidth  camera would  m guessing mic thing fixed launch  could prob live without camera 
maybe s amount data maybe mic adds latency whole thing  guess m going get tpcast ll get bluetooth mic 
wtf  
never used vive mic  got cheap solid wireless 24ghz gaming headset  comfy wo nt issue likes tpcast 
even use microphone vive arizona sunshine coop brother  could happily hermit 
s bottom vive  maybe 2cm infront nose 
link  please let know 
 deleted 
nt know official word  people nt even using direct mode currently  s m saying  feel like people already nt finished product 
s def compression software problem would think 
https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vhos1mcf8aei
bluetooth technology one breaking weakness  ca nt stereo mic active time 
expect s 68 months expect vive replacement ship ll introduce budget package uses current audio strap make deluxe audio strap standard old price 
 wont see market next 24 months  makes think  exactly  given took tpcast one year get wireless solution released  think take anyone else triple amount time 
 wont see market next 24 months  something made completely  reminder  12 months ago nt even know tpcast 
yes  wireless big issue  play space nt vast step couple feet direction  wires nt effect much  already nt excited switch pain wires pain yet another device remember charge take outlet kitchen counter  phone two vive controllers moment   going get  negatives  transmitter squeal annoying everyone else room  batteries manage  mic  1  chance battery explodes back pocket  seem outweigh positives wire five feet pc 
already know  wait 
surprised considering plenty time evaluate could improved rift head strap previous vive head strap 
kinda defeats point audio strap though  nt 
different question  s best  way fit new das head  m still fiddling around find optimal  setting
true  tpcast uses standard usb plug  additional one remains open least provide current 
think means ll see lot youtube videos people get scared run walls 
duh  course s router   smacks forehead  according vive ifixit teardown headset 24ghz wireless module  controllers connect link box s wireless receiver wonder headset s module  would interesting position data could made go headset wirelessly router necessary able handle audio camera 
re correct video pc vive 60ghz  back channel usb data standard wifi prone latency due interference  tpcast using standard wireless hd chipset video capable video transmission nt support usb  nt get mic camera support 
thx mate 
wie bist du überhaupt deutschland ein tpcast gekommen  und wieviel hat das ganze mit versand und steuern gekostet 
catch smaller one  might  max 3a total output  24a max per single port   nt see actual rating page s faq m basing nearly identical looking one https  wwwankercomproductsa1214011 big battery 48a total  one see smaller 4 cell form factor clearly marked 48a total output aluminium cased https  wwwankercomproductsa1315011 dimensions slightly different  fraction narrower fit cradle might loose  clear usb port spacing  placement would line though 
thank prompt reply  recommendations kind padding would ideal  also  d cool posted pictures make people get idea d look like 
probably option enabled enable camera go close bounds  s steamvr settings 
thanks quick response  m real keen tpcast works well m reading  op information heshe acquired d awesome 
ca nt believe spent almost 6 months without using camera  usually play pretty big wired sennheiser headset everytime want drink something someone comes room ask something m totally tangled take headset vive  ll definitely give camera try asap 
finally reasonable fucking answer  ukapalselam giving real answers hard questions 
use blue filter thing  way get full size unfiltered picture 
looool

yeah  makes hesitate 
use wireless mic headset  s problem
bright side  s  250 pocket
get super cheap freestanding mic plugs soundcardmobo
could live desktop mic shout stuff 
yup  tpcast reveals issues time  pretty bad product overall core features disabled using 
headset fit top tpcast transmitter   one 
ah  maybe even dumber followup question  seeing mic integrated headset  activated  like  steamvr settings somewhere  assume always entire time even using headset use vive audio related things 
question  found camera useless  turned 
use drinking beer
finding chair  stepping around stuff  finding headphones  seeing room  bring able talk people  able take drink

oh nt realise  would work tpcast external mic plugged spare usb slot 
god knows meant lol
always understood controllers connect wirelessly headset hmd well controller positions sent pc via usb  also transmitted via usb camera mic data  tpcast replaces first part usb transmission 24ghz router pc link  second part sadly omits 
live downtown munich  germany wifi congestion pretty significant  upon intital setup  tpcast software warned stock configured band detected congested prompted automatic channel switch  nt sync issues whatsoever 
oh sorry mistaken referring  bad  guess ll wait see interference populated areas noticable use

strangely enough get 404 second link provided

windows  activate bluetooth mic  turn mono audio  s kinda  feature  bluetooth technology one expecting people listen music talk time bt tech built around mobiles  look  personally owned bluetooth headset disappointed poor audio compared phone  found put looking online improve audio quality  disable  handsfree   however  disabling also disables mic 
think affects whole standard bluetooth devices  look  https  wwwredditcomrbluetoothcomments5rvpg4petitionforduplexhighqualityaudiofor
typo  meant current strap
reply wrong comment 
person responded talking tpcast 20 another wireless competitor  new headset  m sure doubt competition wireless conversion market  early accounts issues tpcast someone   capitalize  sooner later 
 m passing tpcast certain version 20 competitor s version either make use mic include way  s big issue never address  talking gen 2 headset though competitor tpcast 
find sweetspot  top strap 
mic draws power usb port uses s wireless transmission protocol dedicated receiver 
maybe transceiver link box bluetooth  would make sense 
yeah something odd  reload page briefly flashes anker s 404 loads  one m trying point  powercore 13400mah portable charger   ally case large circular charge indicator button front  actually  noticed product number format  a121xxxx 4cell plastic cased a131xxxx ally cased  last digits 4011 5011 example ally case 5011 48a rating big battery long tedious inference  a121   5011   probably 48a rating re good  maybe  lol 
understood  thank advice 
yes  doubt wireless receiver could handle another 4k  two back forth  60 hertz
assuming bobanaut meant camera activation upon nearing bounds upon reading comment  yes perhaps confused assumed bounds work based camera  agree 
ah ok thanks 
100  positive turned moment  try contact support throught htc  interesting see learn briefed first place
jup  tpcast reduce hardware  add new  wzld also say bad 
seems like strange omission talking transmitting single audio source  possibly data compressed  nt super low latency dependent  compared rest  either  also one big advantage vive rift build mics perfectly placed developers optimize voice chat mics operating default volume 
nt tried  nt fit headset straight vertical able angled either forward back 
currently looking  m basically looking rf wifi based headset  bluetooth due lag  ear cans  nt want getting hot  mic ideally super leightweight  ideas 
timeline word yet 
push talk  would nt perfect would still get job done without echo machine
voice chat implementations good enough noise canceling background noises completely filtered 
im disappointed reddit maxes ve karma 100 would love see turds real score
everything individual says pretty horrendous 
dude trolls  doubt   s right big miss  tpcast disables core features  m hopeful driver setup issue  seems like transmitting mic would much easier 90 fps video  otherwise ll waiting improved version 
 2 mics 
m glad m paranoid one feels like time someone could successfully sneak murder m playing vive  creepy would turn predator mode  call  see someone nt know standing room  thought gets every time lol 
 nt help s pain ass enable 
possible set playback device normal speaker set recording device bluetooth mic 
crazy  phones able fine windows ca nt  😑
yeah
 person responded talking tpcast 20 another wireless competitor  new headset  pretty sure talking waiting one built model headset  rereading  see may meant implying  nt usually see people making argument 
know someone pointed  originally   think meant gen 2 headsets 
trial error  took tries though still pretty good measure noggin old strap 
ll let know worked
4k  still talking camera 
bit strange manual mentions tpcast incompatible frontfacing camera  nt mention microphone  please keep us posted 
agreed  sure wireless headset mic top  another 300g whole construction first wave vive  das tpcast already heavy side  good ear wireless headset decent mic m ears though 
noticed lag whatsoever soundblaster e3 even though s bluetooth  built amp high end headphones pretty nice dac  s bluetooth 21  want go bluetooth 4 pay little get e5  bigger little noticeable clipped belt  s better wifi rf ones tried  yet  lag whatsoever 
push exactly 
yeah  mic near mouth  across room 
used free standing mic  right screen  onward accident  everybody immediately bitched nt audible enough  nt matter possible games nt support elite level noise canceling wo nt help talk three meters away mic facing opposite direction 
reason stop trolls trying get low score possible
agreed 100 
1 mic  s 2 audio sources reason  one disappears steamvr turned  one stays recording devices 
 creepy would turn predator mode  call  call
triad right  suggest  end fighting windows constantly default audio device  least  s happened ended disabling monohandsfree device bluetooth headphones using stereo audio along vive mic  tpcast issue real concern  using bluetooth headset workaround negatives 
yes  would work  long playback input two different devices  ll still stereo sound 
 s poor workaround problem supposed exist  buy proprietary wireless headphones would bypass bluetooth weakness though  want still use headphones 
s illusion phones handle seamlessly nt notice ca nt high quality stereo sound use mic time 
oh ok  post makes sense  also nt think see new headset either till least holiday 2018 
think see problem one ordered  s wider big one   4 cells wide vs 3 cells wide big one   guess ca nt lay flat cradle little fingers  grasp side battery  confusing thing  short  batteries 3 cells wide like existing a1271012 ones single usb port clearly suitable either  maybe tpcast using one anker nt yet store 
thought camera front 4k
htc support told nt provide support tpcast contact manufacturer microphone inquiry  spoke mandarin 
also seems like strange omission talking transmitting single audio source  possibly data compressed  nt super low latency dependent  compared rest  either 
check wireless lapel mic unit  cheap ones ok sound quality  nt recommend super cheap   80 good enough 
http  vmodacomcrossfade2wireless plus boompro mic add  little pricey  really good headphones 
get cheap headset creative soundblaster e3  world s great wired headphones mic well  great range well  s use existing headphonesheadsets already 
nt option implemented game use advanced settings map controller functions togglehold activate mic 
exactly  would distraction filtered re close mic  
 cases 
different mics
oh god  youre right
one usb audio  hdmi audio  believe hdmi audio disappears vive powered 
yeah guess m usually using phone phone  networked gaming device 
100  correct  bank ordered fact wide tpcast cradle  two usb ports also spaced abaout 1mm apart 20100 model way fit cradle without extender cables  also  s lot lighter 20100 version  ll sending one back amazon 
way lower  1280x720 believe  would little point high res cam given res limitation inside hmd 
maybe ucnwind042 help  also tpcast knows mandarin  
really surprised well  previously posted  4mbits data transmitted via proprietary tpcast router given time full use  m sure could fitted another 200kbits mic functional 
d able speak  hearing 
beautiful  yet ear  m looking light 
game uses every button 
re across room    background noise 
nt always like would downvote trolls 500000 negative karma 
s 
bit unfortunate  guess ll focus different direction make good belt system hold  good know usb spacing  might tempted mod battery cradle nt learned  fwiw anker eventually answered say battery max 3a shared  might  enough anyway  run time big battery divided s capacity implies probably 3a needed m 100  sure  guessing inefficiencies  
may right  either way s still lot transmit image data 30  60 hertz 
yup  already contacted himher
think regular sound works  talking microphone  would pretty useless nt also allow hear hmd 
oh  missed part audio  im using wireless headphones anyways right  yeah nt think ppl position 
m sorry feel way
nt really works  background noise generally filtered  consistent  pattern recurring sound  like buzzing example   far away mic nt qualify sound culling 
ugh  anything starve trolls air ok
well  re already researching d like piggy back efforts  m looking whole range different size battery banks  provide ampere current values anker 20100 b  offers two usb ports draw  ve already designed small pouch  hold battery bank attached back das  could seen tpcast renders  m thinking correct weight balance hmd battery pack  might actually make whole setup comfortable due losing frontheavy issues 
seems mic camera ca nt turned tpcast  official response tpcast yet   users reviewers contacted confirmed mic nt work tpcast  ve sent message tpcast customer service mic problem today  waiting reply 
sound works fine arrives hmd via 60 ghz hdmi stream  s going way s bitch  speak 
varying definitions background noise  mine consists three screaming children  otherwise  array microphone would work 
 background noise generally filtered consistent pattern recurring sound  like buzzing example   actually modern systems use multiple mics software triangulation filter background sound  works nicely   front   mic  anyway  proposing would work independent speakers position would also filter pre recorded background noise  instead gf sitting pc clicking stuff well noise movements  importantly  filtering background noise wo nt make magically audible two  three meters away mic facing wrong direction speak 
sure thing  nt much else report batteries yet  hoping things would pan anker ve used several products past good value excellent performance  share whatever else find though 
yet s expected re three inches mic  difference distance  made work small area  sort away nt shitty mic 
sound problem  game audio
need little help  m getting game audio headphones  get dashboard audio clicking around  nothing games  working fine  suddenly quit  ideas things try  already old turn turn back thing  made sure headset set default playback device  kinda stumped 
get issue games nt disable playback devices  sure  seems like nt actually pick  default  device 
ve done googling around  apparently games hard time hdmi output  using usb output reliable  ll give suggestion try well  thanks idea 
pcgamer  handson htc s deluxe audio strap
""
really hope people get preorders go use 1 hour  s one thing comfortable 510minute demo another comfortable prolonged use  doubts serious improvement  would much appreciate review someone lengthy amount time 
write article new audio headstrap  mention audio  smh
seems pretty much fixes concerns original strap  ca nt wait thing hit market 
might sound bad  price drop rift happened already including accessories build headset  brings cost vive  899 technically new headstrap headphones  rift already  opposed  599   59 extra sensor  roomscale  rift  touch  hmm  think price drop definitely order htc  seems tracking issues mostly resolved since new update also  though still really dislike default front facing configuration rift  touch feel s terrible lowest common denominator chosen oculus full vr experience 
rift  200 cheaper  think htc definitely include default headstrap   buying vive  new headstrap cost  900  300 clear rift  early adopters  think  99 ok  yes  maybe add freebies like new 3in1 cable whatever
since vive released made improved straps  3in1 wire  controllers  imminent    d nice throw bone early adopters funding development improvements lol 
wish d sell without headphones 
ca nt wait get  think make default strap new buyers give existing owners viveport credit 
experiences dk2 headstrap choosing go steam vr route one 2 reasons nt vive  charging 100 essentially one biggest weakness vive big mistake  charged already vive want change strap  point onward become default head strap new vives  wont pay £750 vive £100 fix major issue headset  oculus price drop really offer something counter
sounds like winner  ll getting one
sounds like could answer many concerns current strap  mixed feelings attached headphones  htc released one without headphones  3040 maybe even  50 would pick one release date  still need upgrades pc talk upgrading vive lol 
final design new headstrap   far purchase  s complicated product manufacture  surely demand shouldnt hard fullfill  would think could start shipping next month  strong feeling june see vives shipping new headstrap  probably want sell old stock straps till june 
removed
things come updated cable  call preorder bonus something
still nt solve issues development  wish flipped 
reading comments feel like maybe m person world uses vive normal audio setup rather using headphonesearphones  idea wearing headphones already vision entirely obscured makes stressed even  thinking   time  looks like depending £ markup probably cheapest way get better strap short spending hours hours trying find cheap uk source suitable welding accessories  could still worth even earphones need cut 
bad didnt mention headphone quality  obviously going comfortable 
yeah since optional addon  ll waiting sell amazon similar 
 deleted 
definitely getting comes  gladly post review  many others  doubt 
 deleted 
used 20 minutes extremely intense shooting game sweating  yeah  nt tried hours  imo  deluxe audio headstrap pushes vive towards arguably comfortable vr headset world 
hope demo somewhere buy  reviews nt helpful something like comfort  occulus usually said comfortable vive  vive much comfortableit comfortably spreads weight across cheeks head  rift either leaves big gap around bottom  puts weight bridge nose  
nt understand even calling audio head strap  end day s audio  fixing poorly designed head mounting harness 
least must terrible  probably would comment 
least include new strap future vives compete  original strap one things hate vive would cost 150 euros upgrade get one shipped htc 
strap way priced  s  49 maximum industry  htc learn compete price  lg could steal thunder overnight  rifts new price cost market share  days  50 cables  30 shipping needs end  competition 
htc already unfortunately confirmed dropping price response oculus  seems like bad move  maybe know something nt 
much new knuckles controllers cost  although  lighthouse knuckles sold independently  least s impression   see  price  vive standalone headset dropped   trackers  wands 
agree 100    900 hmd package competing  600 hmd package everything  better audio quality  hard compete 
least reduced price current vive owners would kind part  100   plus unnecessarily expensive shipping  plus whatever ll want conversion euros  better really improvement comfort wise 
disagree  rift still doesnt support 360 roomscale  see robo recall  game built roomscale teleportation function built around 180 due rift limitations  gladly pay full roomscale support superior motion tracking  plus vive going accessories moving forward  havent seen anything pipes oculus  got headstrap  tracking puck  tpcast wireless etc  id love see price vive drop others dont really feel justified yet  oculus rift price drop move desparation try contend better vr solution vive  soon steamvr another hmd lg  oculus knows needs cheaper compete superior lighthouse technology 
 already including accessories build headset technically vive audio  although nt use inear buds annoying 
reported much also added free shipping rift   100 cases  took  20 third sensor cost  country dropped price  320 roomscale rift 
ya  like early adopter viveport credits  even merch 
everytime hear someone complaining integrated headphones nt know convenient  really game changer  trust 
nt heard much audio quality built ins  hear razer krakens compatible nearest trash relocated asap 
good thing article legit talks vive sag face making little blurry unless strap tight feel uncomfortable 10 minutes  bad thing guy nt test longer 10 minutes took write short article  pc gamer  even uses website news anyways

biggest issue sitting cord  keeps dragging getting stuck behind  yanking headset  super annoying  need way make cord issue seated 
funny mention  never really issues using vive standing  ve got 100 hours elite  vr  really take get used  nt really bother anymore  get new headstrap though  m sure night day difference 
headset resting face meats  cheekbones  try putting higher  extending top strap shift carry weight top back head  ve issues 100 hours vive  300 hours dk2
one  several headgear mods 
ll take  thanks input 
original strap feels like placeholder prototype 
best thing sell regular strap vives 699 delux strap vive 799 htc nt keen lowering price much
 lg could steal thunder overnight  probably existing vive owners  though  s hundred thousand current owners  large chunk wanting accessory  dare say htc knows gouge us unit price international postage  likely   unfortunately  m already preparing pay around au  200 get strap  anything less pleasant surprise 
rift sold china  htc effective monopoly lg et al start showing  obviously wo nt lower prices 
depends quality headphones  nobody wants built audio subpar  m ok expensive strap decent headphones

use crappy htc earbuds 99  time nt want deal good headphones  even bought super short cable s still much hassle  unless totally suck  use deluxe audio strap headphones 100  time  built headphones plus ratcheting strap make demoing much easier well 
wait  headphones nt come 
m trying develop something unity  swap headphones hassle playtesting  tried using earbuds  ridiculously short earbuds vive came  helped make convenient  wires still got way    started develop things rift  oh man s quick fast  headset  headset  without audio hassle  super convenient  said  integrated headphones fantastic develop vr things play really movementintense  jumpscary   games  nt worry headphones flying damaged  well additional headphone weight head  plan playing  movementintense  games nt plan developing vr things  may able live without integrated headphones  article unfortunately mention anything detachable  hopefully 
audio par  d rather use amazing quality headphones  audio huge part experience 
feel like people drove believing nt want rift  fans obviously boasted  shrug honestly single best feature rift  dramatically increases quality life playing vr deal anything putting headset 
photo looks like would leak sound ton  
audiophile  lot us use really high quality ear headphones nt want huge downgrade sake little bit convenience 
know exactly convenient  also know hard use much better headphones already know fit well comfortable wear long periods time  s reason nt buy monitors built speakers 
 complaining integrated headphones nt know convenient s bit insulting   nt know   nt think  imagine  difference fumbling blind  putting headphones separately  really comes quality vs convenience  quality builtin headphones fine  others  audiophiles  might   strapping couple hour vr  gaming session  extra 30 seconds    nt  game changer   s  convenience   ve got really nice headphones use vr  nonvr gaming  well listening music  m particularly interested tradeoff  understand  many    m going argue make  sacrifice  sound quality better audio  game changer    nt know good sounds

really bothered past  like psychological level  recently remove cord second loop  cord still runs loop  top head   s free dangle way  mean  s purpose second loop  gravity ensures s going go towards ground re standing  setup  cable freely flow chair  sitting  nt constantly yanking headset making want throw garbage

china big deal  hidden behind great firewall never play eg  onward  fair japanese players though 
exactly  response nt mean anything except  nt dropping price exact nanosecond  lol 
sorry  meant predict vive headset standalone option valve launches standalone trackers controllers  nt heard official announcement matter 
yeah played witcher 3 gtx650 graphics card   works   s supported   way looking oculus games supported vive right 
s great  hopefully start giving 360 setup support games robo recall best game ever completely ruined horrible 180 design  almost like epic designed game roomscale oculus said allow 180 like enemies spawn around yet want facing one direction  makes sense 
s correct  tracking identical since 112 patch unless massive playspace   10  users fit category 
fixed  fix mod maps actual game  vive modders fix soon im sure  oculus even says 3 sensor setup supported recommended  robo recall support 360 roomscale due rift limitations  think s epic   fault  fuck  epic designed game like full roomscale oculus cock blocked forcing removal roomscale teleporting  blatantly obvious game designed roomscale  example would bullet train  bullet train front facing design  would ever get attacked front  robo recall 360 roomscale design get attacked angles yet forced face one direction due rift limitations  saying robo recall supports 180 epic made way  saying rift doesnt support roomscale yet 
hey  heard potential touch months released  re still playing catch 
message problem  problem teleportation system locking front facing position enemies around  ridiculous game design amazing game leaves scratching head didnt least give option regular teleporting  remember rift doesnt support 360 roomscale  link official fix confirmation 
come everyone thinks included earbuds dogshit  ve used literally every single time ve used vive sound great  ca nt tell much difference compared  200 astros  re cheap either  re  80 buy  http  wwwhtccomusaccessorieshtcprostudioearphones nt get wrong  d much prefer headphones deluxe audio strap  included earbuds nt abysmal everyone moans 
 earbuds  fine  category  easiest use solution  currently  better cans  nt feel like dealing  35mm adapter fail weeks  m keen constantly swapping devices  except demoing  
 tried using headphones went back earbuds s way convenient comfortable  might sound good extra hassle worth 
think  would pay remove 
 m trying develop something unity   wires still got way  serious questions  use wirelessbluetooth headphones nt wires worry  heck  leaving em hanging around neck headset completely offstowed working 
yeah d rather use m50s

yeah  s huge issue ve got vive setup  theater  room  pc opposite side room theater seats  cable barely reaches chair  ve tempted remove cord loops  go front  ve done yet  either need much longer cable  solution using rigging ceiling solve problem setup

china huge vr also games
pretty sure everyone saying 360 fine 112  word oculus likely remove language 360 experimental within next 2 months
jeeze somebody mute guy  spreading pure disinformation  confident product bought stop spreading lies folks purchases  enjoy vr 
3 cameras 360  get attacked directions robo recall  message displayed turn around  s teleport system keeps cable untangled  hard get head around though admit
 oculus even says 3 sensor setup supported recommended  actually oculus said planing taking beta tag 3 camera roomscale next update  already supported  maybe argue recommended s  beta   even changing 
3 sensor rift setup robots come directions  room scale tracking works perfectly fine  since 112   nt get message say face camera either  taken considering room scale setup 
well past caught  vive catching  s okay  s competition  ca nt wait till players guys company fans knock 
s rift nt support roomscale   s cable management teleporting system  works well  would prefer fixed rotation teleport
oculus supports 360 roomscale setups  https  supportoculuscomhelpoculus1305813889431877  even game listed  official fix also already confirmed teleport  bug  https  uploadvrcommoddersalreadychangedroborecallfit360gameplay
worst problem fit  nt sound awful  give value d consider fair price based 10 years buying iems ranging  20  250   250 ones awful purchase   d say re probably worth  10  15  near comfort sound quality  80  120 iems buy days  would nt use htc s price accessory good indicator value 
offense people comparing actual headphones  gaming headsets 
people complain audio quality included ear buds likely used actually good audio  people like nt issue likely used low tier audio  remember people used apple ear buds garbage tier audio quality  even something like vive ear buds step   80 ear buds bought long time got vive way better quality ones included vive  current main headphones magnitude better included ear buds well worth hassle  also price determine good earbudsheadphones  ve gotten headphones half price beats headphones superior quality  also also  astros pretty freaking garbage  borrowed friends astros absolutely hated  d prefer used crappy  30 headphones astros 
s hassle using headphones  ve kept hesdhphine plugged vive since got slip headset s  feel completely normal 
oh  guy made sound like re combined ca nt remove
s fair  like others said  ll probably like 
likely ends cheaper everybody buy headphones htc develops two products  one  one without headphones  cost running two product lines instead one  cost manage two skus determine market share  make worth retailers use shelf space sell product takes twice space  etc  made two products wo headphones model would probably still cost made one product included headphones 
actually pair bt iems  jaybird x3 s  use working  around house  bt adapter use pc similar broadcom chipset integrated one use vive  bt chipsets enabled  driver one would install detected devices  one chipset would nt work  suppose could manually set drivers device  s pita nt feel like dealing 
yeah  strap basically slices top ear covers tip  s infuriating really  meanwhile oculus gaze interactions always require look pointer  ca nt work people wear thing perfectly straight  must bulkier cheeks 
eybb ll cup yer bun
fair enough  mine hit top ears nt quite  dig  see might suit 
able accomplish thing slightly higher s talking  s definitely ears decent margin

quit lot people sub like  usolomon871 example  comments absolutely hilarious read  actually thought trying ass making fun vive fanboyism taking absolute extreme  pretty sure actually legitimately like 
yeah right  ill stop  ll give explanation way act  purchased vive 4 months ago lurking roculus rvive months  decided vive always support valve steam  admitted fanboy sure  valve deserves army fanbois  d also never support invasive company facebook  anyway  bought vive hooked week started joining conversation subreddits  would post rvive seemed fun games  would post roculus  every  single  time  would get attacked even mentioning vive  kind threw  impression communities somewhat friendly early adopters revolutionary technology right  something common passion pc gaming whole idea virtual reality  went kind wore  always wanted member greater vr community almost like shut community consumer choice made  time went became salt  friends play time fully understand  like oculus touch dropped  shortly bought vive  entire community went defensive mode realized lighthouse tracking appeared superior time  honesty think entered oculus community bad time  actually enjoying subreddit lately apologise unintentionally troll bit 
yeah dont give shit message  teleportation makes game extremely disorienting  never issue cord game  sure sometimes untangle means designing games cumbersome disorienting teleportation prevent tangle lmao 
really  d love try wireless rift  nt noticed  things coming vive m treating already  like rifters 6 months re touch  rift purist  touch sitting controller way oculus intended 
worste ever  seriously cant think game good bad locomotion system  fact get official fix robo recall become best vr game market  damn near unplayable anyone used 360
official fix  thats mod vive community works mod maps  fix actual game   know lol 
use red foam tips  fit way better
either way  re still bad  re best earbuds ve ever used 
find hassle use nice headphones  definite 1st world problem kind hassle  extra cord length  taking setting removing hmd indeed annoying compared included ear buds  take hmd even think  put back hanging right next ears ready go 
ive seen cant remove  swivel way use regular headphones
m nearly positive removable  nt said sure  looking pictures look removable  still  htc said one way afaik
headphone market big  hope realize need provide option remove headphones  choose ear headphones day week would extremely annoying couldnt enjoy better strap without forced use supplied headphones 
gotcha  curious  issue game back  using one bluetooth headphones 
 diving rolls     way anyone diving rolls £800 strapped face 
ve played around settings lot  ca nt remember exactly lot guides optimize ed  think   advanced settings ss  15  ingame ss  10  hmd quality  12515 m using 1080 bunch settings change around best suit needs allocate resources things important 
thanks  definitely going pick one 
interview sub yesterday  end interviewer asked cable short said re planning plugging cable battery pack transmitter  sure  putting back pocket  wireless  says s still development  s used wired connection gdc 
appreciate sentiment  case nt know oculus sub filled lot trolls vocal antifacebook  therefore anti oculus  type people awhile  pretty bad  nearly positive mention oculus would get downvoted  lot people tend get bit defensive sometimes  nt excuse anything  perspective people might irrationally lashed mentioned vive  make mistake  oculus sub plenty fanboys girls haha 
ehh slip trolling mode time time  nature beast 
 valve deserves army fanbois companies nt need fanbois
saying despite many users enjoying roomscale games rift system capable roomscale one game mishandled teleportation  dev  assume name 
agree  least option
epic announced ll teleportation fixed within month  nothing rift s capabilities 
d love try wireless vive  except ca nt s still available 
wireless rift available day wireless vive  item makes wireless 
already said patch coming  see mod coming 
even read article page title    reached epic games ask plans allow three sensorusers remove feature  spokesperson told us company releasing patch later month address issue  
re bad nt fit everyone nt include wide enough array tips mitigate  re bad ca nt share headset people  unless fine getting ear wax ears vice versa  yes  sound quality bad  s also good 
cheap  ish  ajays 3 4 better  htc ones good sound  bit surprised cause expected suck  bit bulky ears though 
really offense means nt used decent iems  nt spend  300 get better sound  multiple tips goes long way least 
re ok use eg  sennheiser hd598 overear headphones  strap  big weight face cord feel stifled  earphones help somewhat
bought astros  highly doubt ve bought decent iems compare  edit  busted package  re worth  20 
m pretty sure enough force 
ca nt removable s bullshit  nt mind
edit  anyone confirm 
think s bit missed opportunity  m sure chipset link box capability pair none vive devices  bet driver stack probably missing services  bt audio 
 even smashed head  course laid almost cracked skull wide open  even bought foam padding hard edges bordering play area  point  hmd yank face  guess s moot though june ll wireless 😀
awesome  thanks info  would make lg headset quite competitive  ve got vive already  brother thinking getting one  think m gon na hold see lg offer 
judging response roculus think ll patching something  people seem almost unanimously dislike way works 
arguments aside  current method teaches different way teleporting  s damn difficult get used disorienting first way sort makes sense able reorient arival  30 min m starting get feel kind like  teleporting behind bot forward direction facing back physically turning forward grab handle appear front surprisingly satisfying  still feels weird  d like spend bit time get used 
 announced  good enough  like hearing touch 5 months prior release  play one set rules  rift users happened write  announcement means release 
already mod disables progression sucks  im going tough unlock everything play modded version fix comes  really shocks released triple game one single god awful locomotion solution lone wolf developers implementing numerous options locomotion 
yes address teleportation  address  face front die  message could care less   also already mod reduces size 10000 x lol 
fell ears constantly 
issue  sound quality fine m audiophile  even small buds hurt ears 20 minutes  want convenient overear solution
actually  used work audio engineer back college opportunity use decent iems 
seriously  astros got absolute worst cans ever tried  d take original apple ear buds astros 
confirmed exactly  removable  could link 
 bit missed opportunity good point  integrating  making sure highquality bt audio supported natively would ve great  alongside assuaging concerns integrated headphones like rift  got sony mdr 1000x  sound fantastic  bluetooth s really come long ways quality 
games mishandling teleportation rift capabilities  either obtuse trolling 
jesus dude  read anything  whole article teleporting issue single word face forward message  m done 
route like    https  iimgurcomzqaqln2jpg  
im confused re best iems ve used ve also worked audio engineer  gaming sounds like effects  nt big deal  m playing audio shield listening music m familiar listening voices discord  vive earbuds lack lot fidelity almost distracting  used better iems long durations  found incremental improvements audio equipment nt apparent ve gotten used went backwards  s start expecting certain sounds ends distorted missing

yea  willing bet college days long ago  enough longer acclimated top tier audio 
tried double checking  either tested dan obrien s tweets saying removable 
 fall nt fit ears  nt tugged anything  d also much rather use ear headphones

sent one controllers 123 issue  praying get back reasonable amount time  warranty also expires next month suppose im lucky least happened warranty  nt know im gon na whenif one issue  got ta try fix suppose 
literally everything since day 1 rock solid perfect  never lost tracking never problems 
owned vive year  controllers still perfect  bring quite lot parties gets bit abuse 
fine  s 3 months though 
steam vr occasionally tells one controller nt ontracked s working fine  occasionally exiting steam vr nt power lighthouses like s supposed  count oddities rather issues nt way interfere actual use  early adopter  got first month   expected problems  m happy 
one squeaky trigger  goes away temporarily blow really hard seams  even dropping lubricant nt fix permanently
vive owner since last week  issues tracking result set 
vive owner nearly year  issues 
ve vive since june 2016  controllers developed squeaky triggers sometimes nt return way  0  weak touchpads 12 2 blame thumper touch pads  game murders  since warranty expired took controllers apart repaired rubber pad  gave triggers touch electronics lubricant  re good new  also  thumper 
ve got trigger s slow come back  m sure many clicks guys rated  definitely nt put many hours compared mouse 
owned almost 14 months  controllers still work perfectly 
went 2 controllers right top thumb pad woking correct  repaired one bought new one  
issues one controller charging 2nd week  got ahold support fixed 
one controller s fw wo nt update  tried going troubleshoot list several different computers  gave since still works 
squeaky triggers dodgy sensitivity track pads  nothing game breaking  year  use times week 
controllers still work great faint trigger squeak  ve punched walls ceiling times  hell  even accidentally punched friend straight face playing superhot 
one triggers bad squeak awhile went away  track pads far high quality struggle whenever click particular direction  one almost dead zone one controller  get click easily 
remember really dinky wrist straps launch  playing holoball  wrist strap snapped  controller went flying wall  htc charged  129 replace  thank goodness upgraded straps 
got controllers day 1 preorders  s time  never problem 
rma controllers 3 weeks getting vive  one controllers still squishynessno response sometimes started month getting rma back  also  occasionally get sticky grip button  reclicking seems fix 
slight dead zone 3 clock  first hmd bad board  still love 
mine nt connect unless plug first  perfect 
one controller s touchpads gone little mushy nt nice  controlled press  however  performance nt affected   issues 
though lots helpful things comments fix issue  nt fix underlying issue whopping 23  us reddit controller issue could get accurate  vive owners poll  showed percentages magnitude m almost certain htc would something  know knuckles controllers likely coming semi soon nt mean hold broken controller poor job manufacturing 
one randomly turns 
ive touchpad problem 2 different vives  times likely due hitting controller  psa  fixed tapping side controller 
mine work fine  grip buttons feel unresponsive  nt move verry much  click  
poll concludes cal poll sweat damage  curious commen 
squeaky triggers
perfect since launch 
squeaky creaky buttons since day one  ca nt wait knuckles arrive 
perfect since purchase late january
touchpad finger tracking  issues tracking finger near corners  actual  clicks 
vive 6 months  get weird jittery re super close dead battery 
wait  tracking loss loose ribbon cable  right controller issues since beginning  lazy contact support 
launch day trackpads nt track thumb position consistently  resolved first firmware patch 
need little bit help survey  controllers turn always showed blue light matter earth tried  would never pair show green light  forced send whole vive back  option survey choose 
bit squeaking one triggers  went away short order  otherwise ve issues controllers  despite banging walls ceiling one occasion 
mine came thumb sticks 
get accurate result  probably radio button poll is controller issues  yesno   asis  someone respond positive issues  skewing results heavily favor problems  category  especially considering wellknown sub trolls undoubtedly checked every yes  box available  nt expect results anywhere close accurate representative  due nature poll type used 
considering people far likely vote ve problems  response far leans pretty heavily towards problems rare  good post reference people accuse htc poor qc 
suspect grip issue much prevalent reported survey  issue games require hold grip buttons  nt play games wo nt affect  also ’ felt  appears software glitch  ’  unless ’ issue steamv r  climbey  hold grip buttons walk  occasionally  walk function stays enabled even let go grips  click grips disable walking  altspacevr used grip buttons hold objects  juggling  occasionally object would stick hand  making quite frustrating experience 
also problem  squeaks feels little rough  still works fine  dad newer one think fixed problem  since newer hasnt happened yet 
story wife life 
problem one controllers 
 parents friends try vive one would constantly squeeze one trigger hold  squeaks slightly ever since 
well re going like fixed trigger  disassembled whole controller  included tiny ribbon cables  might able avoid holding trigger putting couple drops top part  hinge   case  part spring slightly misaligned nt work  tremendous pain ass  well worth

wd40  literally takes 2 minutes fix  dont even need disassemble anything
break hours 
pad underneath pad button slides place little bit  take controllers apart affix tiny bit glue  s solved problem permanently users 
https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4lkkh1guidehowtofixyourstucktrackpadinthevive tools wiling negate warranty fix  ve controllers never issue either since 
one controllers exact problem 
one mine wo nt click 3 oclock 
hit controller hand opposite side knock rubber back place  quick fix
many people problem  s absurd sold controllers massive flaw  s always broken spot everyone 
mine starting go  rapidly firmly click tend alright bit eventually settle back somewhat squishy rather clicky  also issue one triggers resetting 0 pressed  make 1  actuated stop sometimes cause issues dev game set use every degree trigger move  tried taking one apart see could fix circle pad issue  figure ll buy replacements needed  wait knuckle controllers   everything seemed perfect inside  fact  circle pads seem far simpler design thought far m concerned black magic  expected 4 individual buttons side circle one center  1 center button apparently tilt acknowledge direction pressed  least understanding seeing  maybe missed something 
s  yay 
pm 
exact spot 3 controllers 
holy shit widespread problem  one controllers crapped exact spot 
repaired one controllers issue  would click clicks doesnt register  seems rubber ring clicks button worn compressed forceful use long time got ta add padding  definitely big issue controllers quality issue  hopefully new trackpads th knuckles wont issues

start club  nt issues terms malfunctioning  well  maybe one  floor always lower real floor unless place controllers short box room setup 
thread
 low ceilings  half dozen different people smashed ceiling hard enough scrape stucco ceiling  zero problems 
honest knuckle controllers free everyone bought old shitty controllers constantly break  s something valve would never though 
percentage may great tell  least  assuming poll nt heavily abused  re going get number users affected certain issues 
nt think ll unbalanced  m asking  controllers good     tell controllers bad 
well considering people nt issues re wrong 
people without issues owned vive 6 months 
game  looks great  little disappointed lack sale 
lubricate  thats normal maintenance
 ey sold controllers massive flaw  s always broken spot everyone 
yeah understand people thinking s exaggerated echo chamber  think nt actually common hardware issue kinda silly point 
16 times excessive  16 full sets  except sensors  
good see post  d like hear arcade owners well  anyone set handful friends problems 
yay actually somewhat representative story  sound like good idea breaks 
far apart base stations  trouble mine far away  also tried using sync cable  maybe something room interfering connection  tried positions room ensure nothing obscuring view lighthouses 
redone vr set  problem sensors stands moved slightly  puppies bumping   recalibrating made issue go away part 
tracking problem could related controller visible either sensor  move setup lot reproduce behavior  recroom less  fairly easily 
controllers would nt update uninstalled msi supercharger  s utility board allows higher amp draws charging things  anyone else problems try removing extra utilities may installed usb 
thanks adding feedback 
prepare  survey skewed   really nt matter anyway several hundred users experiencing problem evidence problem  beyond small reddit sample  s reasonable expect s much larger number users total 
exactly  made poll  s small problem  people claiming 80  silly  gives us realistic numbers  though admittedly still anecdotal 
boom  lot people headphones fail rift  neither immune problems 
 deleted 
d impressed anything touch controllers  really like controllers  damn vibrations nt ridiculously loud  especially m holding   nt take much minor shift cause haptics go near silent loud unfortunately  really long s acceptable ranges s much anyone  depends loud annoying really 
thank feedback
jesus already  s bad  curious hit anything  dropped  even seemed really insignificant  mine took 5 months stopped 
know feels  nt expect replacement fare better   voided warranty 4 times fixing controllers replacement controllers 
long whole process  m problem nt want without controllers month  considering live point 
common issue  thank feedback 
could definitely issue  wonder might odd usb bandwidth issue packets getting lost controller  watchman dongle hmd  usb pc  separate usb controller card pc d try rule 
poll nt ask broken  asks issues   thanks adding response 
largely agree  controllers  p
thanks adding results  
yeah rubber setup bad  either eventually squishes use become thin touch click stop registering  flat gets shoved everything goes hell  m sure anyone nt issue would still see bad design situation d open controller look flimsy little pad  s bad   shitting whole controller  overall s fantastic  one part junk  
m pretty sure every owner scuff marks walls controllers  p thank answer 
willing take apart double check ribbon cable connections  yeah ll add option still  silly omission 
could issue trackpad manifesting different way  maybe could usb bandwidth issue controllers losing packets transit 
thanks input  sure put poll   
s option firmware issue poll page  staying synced tends issue  usually related usb chipset pc side 
lucky  make sure put poll page  
sounds like problem room setup like reflective surfaces  maybe near airport  anyone remember weird case  
didnt put survey experience issue hardware  pc side  bad usb chipset 
m boat  controllers tank  glue trackpad baffle junk  
cool  put poll 
totally agree  vive still amazing product especially first gen  way stats serve insult htc valve vive  simply gathering data know needs improved future 
think lot people grip issue survey shows  ’ widely noticed games something release grips  first thought buggy software  ’ seem anything wrong hardware  noticed multiple apps 
admittedly issues minor  trackpad one though m surprised high  expected like 5  still high 
problem fiance s computer  turns s usb chipset
s precursor big trackpad issues  good luck 
would love suggestions improve poll  tools use make accurate  never expected big response m glad  hope s light actual situation 
ve got poll answer clicks  since s caused problem 
s probably usb issue  usually plug controllers another usb get recognized start vr
similar issue today  fixed following instructions  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4dnvzcpsathingstotryifyourehavingcontroller third solution guide witch labeled  mildly dangerous  seemed fix  careful though  sure try safe steps first 
oh dear  ll contact htc one m afraid 
really  allows us see good percentage   per problem    look  problems vs none  good measurement  m reading  23  owners polled reported issues trackpad  d add percentages problems together divide 10  number problems added   something complicated  get comparison  problems vs none   s made  us look percentage voters specific issue  right still accurate say  1558 users polled  356 users reported issues trackpads  23  reporting users   argue population chooses respond biased  probably degree  statistic wrote still accurate scope answers 
currently 4 votes “ menu system button issues ” vs 416 trigger issues  seems unlikely troll votes make significant portion votes 
considering eager people put anyone says s issue d bet results actually pretty balanced  still anecdotal sure  s clear issue  large still air always unless htc releases numbers  gon na happen   made help people see controllers good  friends  good  nt mean nt large issue nt seeing 
one month old new version  one squeaky trigger 
lubricate  thats
try lubricating
someone suggesting hitting controller firmly hand  might work things well 
yeah going try dabs greaselube holding trigger  hopefully would fixed  every time think nt feel like getting ass  p

headphones rift  yrah110  one die like many others  guys fixing  hear oculus really persuaded fix  sounds like massive flaw rift 
think combined input  touchpad  component center button click register user clicking

day 8 vive owner  sending faulty controller back soon packing slip arrives email 
htc produced standard vive wands valve producing knuckles controllers  nt give discounts  read somewhere considering offering discount current customers  sure s true d track 
people report issues results still skewed  ’ say accurate survey 
still mean results skewed
mine since launch  issues
proof claim 
s bull  yet typical posts  go troll elsewhere  owned since first wave  well 12mths  issues 
owned since launch literally problem squeaky trigger  forget soon load game 
hello wellknown oculus shill  headphones rift days  looks like lot  lot  people one die good way fix  still working salty died try make better buying lesser vr system 
believe common issues  think bulk people fine  far data seems support  least look one issue vs issues 
ca nt say enough good things  s lighter hearted doom mixes diablo event horizon  multiple locomotion options  fantastic weapon drops  armour  augmentations  classes  skill trees  s fully fleshed game actually breath fresh air  lots story missions well survival  side missions  leaderboards  name  complaint weapons handling  inventory overwhelming  devs seem active m sure get right  bought discount launch  would qualms paying full price 
yeah seems fixed  little uncomfortable without taking apart wish nt  controller great
 thats normal maintenance agree s nothing inherently bad part maintenance  s super simple fix   remember one controllers s ever done  long ago seriously ca nt remember  squeaking common issue implies build issue nowadays  though one minor would generally treat nonissue 
yepp  got ta remember though  running actively used 11 hours day  year underestimating  got probably 3 months came  plus count today add another 3 months  like 18ish months  like said though  usually simply controllers  open whole new set get new controllers like  might well use new headset 
need little bit help survey  controllers turn always showed blue light matter earth tried  would never pair show green light  forced send whole vive back  option survey choose 
6 meters apart  nt tried sync cable yet though  tried different positions might try different angles maybe 
nt recalibrated long  actually  ll next time use vive  thanks tip 
re welcome 
s obviously skewed people problems much likely going ones vote  really need someone research opposing polls like  nt problem   threads  compare polls stuff know minor issues observe skew  sample nt perfectly random across vive owners ll likely bias matter 
im pro rift  im anti people brushing squishy touchpad minor issue
get exactly  vive months used loads often noticed tracking seem shift  waving arms seems get back right place  reading thread sure whether actually issue controllers 
well clobber shelf play session noticed problem happening   controller nt shown issues  yet  
nt think month  maybe 2 weeks max 
thanks  two usb s vive going one https  smileamazoncomgpproductb00fpimicarefohauisearchdetailpage  ieutf8  psc1 take hint another redditor squeezing plastic side pop place  hear snap piece must misaligned  small shift m sure controller issues  maybe m lucky d

interesting  whole usb aspect vive connection part understand least  also think issue wands  certain  
could something like  set mates 
s childish bug  vive release  quite impressed quality hardware  done short time frame 
 thanks
agreed  many issues serious  nearly quarter famed 3 oclock track pad issue  way high  really wish htc would front issue  must know 
based results people took survey 335 people least exact problem controller thats quite bit sales numbers many vives sold 
really  issue touchpad locomotion  move finger around without actually clicking  buy yeah  also issues clicking fixed 
uinsufficientmind tried  mildly dangerous option   nt work  option survey page choose 
 m reading  23  owners polled reported issues trackpad  unfortunately  wrong  23  ticked boxes trackpad issue  ticked three boxes  counts three separate votes  means number people perfect controller represented percentages  much depends many people multiple issues 
basic survey statistics say people likely take time respond negative experiences positive  orders magnitude  plus survey nt separate problems caused htc vs user error abuse  simply existence problems  half participating rate product performing  perfectly  s damned good  official survey result percentages similar would feel encouraged htc  s looking good  may goal proving one thing instead re redeeming htc  showing issues rare   
 m certain s people squeezing trigger like lives depended hold onto controller though 
s worth try  long re putting teaspoon lube  ll fine  hingetrigger mechanism kinda sealed main board  little wo nt go anywhere really 
problem self  glue probably wasnt enugh manufactured  first time slide sticky pad  got dislodged week  reopend 2nd time added glue duct tape  far issue 23 weeks  example video  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vxe1jhjzwzp8 also several post regarding fix issue  along photos step step  feel free msg u need help 
https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4lkkh1guidehowtofixyourstucktrackpadinthevive done controllers  works perfectly  controllers nt issue since 
hit controller hand opposite side wo nt click  rubber falls place
uncalled
true imagine would require sort proofofpurchase  link read 
ass
s wellknown troll  ignore  downvote roll 
good know ll definitely purchase 
oh lubricated mine without taking apart  get non conductive plastic safe lubricant squirt tiny amount gap around trigger  squeeze trigger times apply lube still squeaks  almost year ago nt squeaked since 
leftover sensors 
old headsets 
survey really  yes   option 
 6 meters apart nt 5 meter distance  try reconfiguration 5m setup least sync cable 
every often run controller calibrations rerun room setup things tend move around time  even case re hard screwed walls  
point made 400 people problem problem  s reasonable assume number larger wild  even little bigger  still regarded common problem issue controller s design 
s fine fixed issue new hardware revision shipped rmas nope  replacement controllers flaw
would probably hit doesnt turn
basic research sub shows people defensive vote positive posts vive vote negative posts  want vive look good 
used small square duck tape  holding perfectly 3 months  use liquid  gel  super glue  s necessary nt lying around 
true  fixed 3 oclock clicking 
nt  yrah110 comes time shill oculus attack vive  little thing becomes reason vive owners revolt  stir trouble every chance gets 
idea whether re planning sell discount existing customers m sure ll selling via steam  d able give discount accounts vive associated certain date  m pretty sure ll access serial number  
wish could source  lem try googlefu 
never technically  leftovers   pretend demo  everything stops working  open new one put non working one back box  simply write one return gets sent back manufacturer  thing nt use sensors new box  new sensors stay box old stuff goes box  gets returned 
see comment above
5m limit optical sync lasers  losing sync sync cable help tracking  likely culprit loose ribbon cable donut tracker

nt see big deal wear headphones top  nt even use connector vive since equally long cord 
read many reviews amazing  bought deluxe audio strap ebay  220  worth every penny even double retail 
thinking opposite  playing onward days das  going remove headphones go back using g930  able pinpoint exact location footsteps gunfire useful das headphones nt capable  s marginal comfort increase  definitely worth  100 alone 
shame htc never looked negative comments rift coming s audio solution  sure great option many pc gamers solution already nt see need would removing paying anyway  better strap worth something  paying part would never want use crazy priced  lot vive owners hmd around year happily using ever headsetaudio set already  something probably part standard model sold time 
one biggest problems rift vive bc large nose found hmd s would uncomfortably resting nose  das much improved comfort moving pressure forehead instead  ridged strap also nicer tougher original  much easier configure multiple people audio completely secondary reason bought  comfort  also nice bonus  using included audio dangling convenient pull away instead plugging ears
completely disagree felt massive pressure face das equipped really tried configure properly different strappings  audio part really good though 
d love demo pair  current head strap fits well  love headphones  headphones already cost  300

yeah  s really disappointing s dear  d great new vives shipped das default  everyone already brought vive  ie  us pioneering early adopters supporting new tech  could get much lower cost £35 d get  £100 chance 
worth  100  nice little perk  budget  way  thing maybe  15  20 worth plastic materials  rational market price closer  50   100  htc steamvr monopoly  expect kind pricing headsets  mostly fanboy sub  ca nt intelligent critiques things  say headphones leave lot desired  instead cup  style goes ear soft minicup  hard plasticy rubbery material presses ear nontrivial force via locking mechanism  find uncomfortable  overly  enough make question designers decisions  imagine lot locking  needs  obvious  feature d want chinese vr arcade things get beat want lot pressure ears drown arcade sounds around  home nonissues add certain level discomfort  would preferred softer headphone cup  also impressed sound quality  yes passable hardly  deluxe   also replies  beats headphones like  250 bargain  silly  like complaining honda dealership asking  50000 civic dealer justifying saying  bentley goes  250000 bargain  
strap  knuckles  3in1 cable new lighthouses  s missing new hmd  re clearly gearing releasing new kit  wonder going sell hmd since people already upgraded pieces first release happy pay twice parts already re forced get whole kit  selling hmd get situation people using old parts s pr risk customer support  imo really consider kind tradein deal current vive owners 
really  worth every penny 
s comfort sound quality headphones ease use alone worth 100 
s ideal true far insane  ve spent sushi nice restaurant two 
agree one  use wireless headphones well overear opposed onear yuck    love action headphones snap  s really neat  headphones much better  m going back forth removing headphones  leaving 
advice get suggesting different ways put 
s really good point  fiddle bit  found right settings great 
say top head  mean top forehead headhead  top forehead ends hurting 
right  okay  thought must something wrong  kept twisting dial  bruised head  never would thought  ll try days  lol 
put  nt immediately blown away comfortable  fact  would never call hmd ve tried comfortable  main difference indirect  without initially realizing  fact s less uncomfortable extended play time  enjoyment  quite bit 
yeah  cad  euro  etc  prices insanely inflated  think  3040 usd  see market small enough d worried recouping development costs 
would s much comfort strap audio part  s much quicker put  comfortable balanced  easier share multiple people due quick adjust  built audio great though  deal earbuds popping manage separate set phones  major upgrade overall experience 
 currently use sennheiser hd558 tuck wire shorts looks like cable headphones removable  stick nt switch das headphones  highly recommend something like  15cm cable   https  ae01alicdncomkfhtb1gtwrjvxxxxbcxfxxq6xxfxxxlultrafontbshortbfontfontb35mmbfontauxfontbcablejpg   eliminates headphone cable hassle almost completely  probably would need one slim connector though  looks like jack headphones recessed 
nice headset used das  shockingly good audio  esp  size  really convenience thing  amount audio quality games compensate flipup comfort ease use  imo  edit  unless re playing intense rpg  use cans  daytoday  
re getting 558 s plugging straight headset anyways 
hell yeah  longer need wear headset get good audio  audio really good enough  decent even  like listening flac anyways 
sound quality wise find das perfectly ok s purpose  m going imply s better sennheisers s perfectly decent audio quality hardcore audiophile would find issue  comfort convenience wise though  thats das shines  much less hassle one cable worry put headphones separately  also nt worry headphones slipping frenzied sessions anymore 
fair  nothing unique special das  s difficult manufacture  special materials  shelfish audio  material cost fraction asking price  s niche market 
actually new head mount  adjustment d need make tighten via dial back  easy  https  wwwvivecomeuvivedeluxeaudiostrap
 ratchet mechanism similar psvr  s much comfortable 
idea  far htc pretty adamant retaining price point  worth 100  hope lower cost vive better compete oculus 
got mine last week  worth  really doubt get cheaper  80 time soon goes sale 
actually dislike headphones come  strap major improvement 
taking headset  sharing friends developing  separate headphone pain ass  s huge step ease use built  usually get suited play single long block time see attractive plus
1  s velcro strap use attach cable back das  uneven weight  cable running along side noticeable  s looks like  http  imgurcomwm2lhmz 2 yes  das designed fit either old new cable  use old one works fine 
vr recommended developing eyes like 5yo child  rather  clinically untested yet 
one friends 8 year old love tilt brush  lot problems original falling forward face new one fits significantly better  additionally m sure ve noticed  trying get old system tight possible huge pain s tough tell point velcro system enough contact hold properly adjust readjust times get even reasonably tight fit  case one  go man

headphones nt great  simply love strap  m thinking removing headphones well 
tell truth m sure s worth price  m really happy bought  step comfort convinience  price still high  would easily worth 100 eur together shipping  however payed 140 eur quite frankly much  mean  das nt magicaly transform vive new hmd comfortable ll completely forget playing  comfortable couple times actually forget m wearing  m still much looking forward second gen s better ergonomics lighter hmds

look like headphones  40  50 headstrap  5060  makes feel little better haha
yeah  suppose really mean say device nt worth money  s obviously good  think main point wish htc gave existing vive owners sort discount  felt like appreciated  
needed headphone solution  big headphones make hot hard time keeping place games  earbuds kept getting pulled 31 running next headphone wire  kept rubbing pulling buds ear  solution 2 big issues 
still fence buying one demo use  original strap fits head fine others issues  headphones removeable  might okay demoing family friends ll probably use bose soundlinks 
 s missing new hmd  re clearly gearing releasing new kit  imo     really consider kind tradein deal current vive owners  know vive 20 year two away  lg knows else releasing hmd sooner
makes sad bought htc vive kit like month two ago  havent even opened box yet hear theres better equipment coming soon  fml

adjust top strap make tighter  made difference
put vive face  lower headstrap head 
thing  depends shape head  re many different preferences  s  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments6nh0aqtopofheadhurtsafterlongusageofdasdk9e1p8 back strap high  thinking make less pressure top head  wrong  pulling low went made difference 
yeo 199  improvement  really makes experience better think actually better psvr oculus straps  s iteration  vive owners nt going replacing hmds time soon gen 2 25 3 come  excellent investment 
s top  headhead  problem 
thanks reply  looks pretty cool alright  know issues tpcast  like attaching tpcast top audio problems 
quite true  top strap adjustment  nt need change unless sharing das people different size heads
see multiple people playing ideal  get lysol go hehe  glad s mine  read time people sweating funking headsets pretty good 
thanks bunch reply  s really helpful know 
understand potential risks  s wave two brookhaven experiment   
thank reply
complete opposite opinion  love headphones strapping comfortable enough 
thanks heads  maybe wait price drop dealoffer  think sell gen1 finance gen2 
https  enwikipediaorgwikicognitivedissonance
rather give 2x amount money taiwanese company company founded fellow countrymen  https  enwikipediaorgwikihtc
still ebay buy brandnew hmd problems fixed still money left buy software  otoh  brandloyalty bitch 
late reply  foam pretty thin strap issue probably issue worn properly  needs fitted differently vive throws people 
sweat  extreme workouts  rift  dreaded nosegap  wonders  fanless  ventilation also lets orient room  pick stuff  etc  buying expensive accessories fix outofthebox problems headset ticket rabbithole  basically whole point replying op
well m saying s possibility nt expect valve price gouge like htc  fact re even going trouble design sell directly might related understandable frustration htc 
calculation head also like headphones lot better initially thought  pressure ear  ear  ear extra weight makes forget completly 
sound  120 sony gold wireless headphones using  impressive since resting ear   plus feel much comfortable  head nt sweat ear headphones longer get tangled cord trying get  happy purchase paid canadian   170 
pretty much   50 betterthanaverage headphones  price strap negotiate   1530  whatever  ignore altogether  let s make  0  ask   50 worth comfort das   50 worth relieving pain eye sockets original mount  d say hell yeah  regrets  like everyone ever bought said  ve done sooner 
mainly rift user tell attached headphones great even quality nt good others makes much easier pick headset put 30mins always also mess additional headphones  great demoing  also every day use  das probably worth  100  actual quality life improvement might worth much 
yes  easily removed 
s especially useful demo use s far  far easier adjust put  ll cut turnaround people substantially 
lol ok buddy  ur using hdmi audio  400  seiheizer headphones deluxe audio strap makes miss 
thanks  try next time 
finally look without discomfort  actually forgot couple times m wearing hmd  s incredible feeling makes even excited second gen hmds hopefully even lighter comfortable 
htc reallly cares ecosystem  make next gen product compatible das  also means able buy hmd separate strap aka  upgrade  version  less   think comfortable would device 4050  lighter current hmd 
think saw tpcast used audiostrap research  said however sceptical tpcast seems unpolished first market  wait htcintel wigig solution 
found adjusting beyond factory fold made things worse holding headset  necessary adjustments made dial back 
definitely  rift dk1 dk2  always sold price dropped much  meant couple months without hmd  nt problem dk1 dk2  since gathering dust long selling  s quite different story vive however  best games coming right  s still quite incredible  big jump gen1 vr early dev kits  complete gimmick new medium 
nt make sense  nt think understand concept linked

 htc vive virtual reality headset developed htc valve corporation   someone buys vive support america taiwan https  enwikipediaorgwikihtcvive
would rather give white ceo money rather asian one  wtf fyi pay htc shit 
buy new  d agree  oculus moment really tempting  vive already  knuckles around corner promise extendability third party accessoriesheadsets switching would mistake imho
d giving money king douchebags  mark zuckerberg  never  rift fine product  s terrible person  loyalty towards htc 
re probably right  took get vive fit right nt spent amount time rift 
nt think nose gap improving ventilation really fix    different  compromise  sure  find useful orient pick stuff  reducing sweating great  plenty people find immersion breaking  disclaimer  tried rift  going secondhand accounts 
m expecting around 120 pair 
also sure headphones  never fan ear type pleased really like unnoticeable  definitely solved problem 
made great point forgot  using headphones buds came vive  deal loop headphones  found annoying 31 cable  using audiotechnicas good quality wire pretty heavy annoying 
question still is  100 worth comfort das  nt care headphones first place  d happily buy sku without  50 preferably lower  d much sooner wear headphoneless das dt770s decent iems pay much extra included headphones strap 
around  50 gets better headphones das offers 
think deluxe strap audio good would absolutely floored rift audio  das audio good 
oddly  hdmi audio nt stand custom modded  1700 denon d7000s hooked  3500 mcintosh mha100 ampdac  m sure senns great though  buddy  amp using drive  probably  hd650s  great headphones  re also 300 ohm impedance  nt trying run soundcard 
production standpoint  tit seems would wise htc stick das currently designed  beat production cost retooling etc  stick design generation hmd  works 
already standard  price gap feature  almost nothing bom selling standard already  nt really see huge incentive make compatible vive 2 lg hmd already looks like new gold standard straps  vive 2 needs least match lg shown  need iterate even next pack 
think follow suit  great purchase  much fun keen stay cutting edge technology 
buy headset whim  later realize s expensive lesser value competition  start bullshiting rationalizing zuckerberg s fault   understand concept  seen work zillion times
considering achieving opposite effect intended  continue shilling  
 please shill elsewhere  wtf  please explain
 might think usa country world exactly  uk  zuckerberg countryman mine 
btw  love valve openness hate oculus shitty walledgarden approach  comes money vrhardware  nt let politics get way rationality
damn hate miniscule nose gap vive 
makes good adjustable 
nt care headphones either  getting das m finding really like built headphones  makes experience much smoother 
usin philips fidelio x2s  way hell would go back  sure  thesound better  oh man  able put tighten vive less 5 seconds  thats bloody priceless  das headpones still deliver audio simmilar quality sennheiser pc360

m chiming ironic argument pricing high get terms value  yet difference sound quality 5200 dollar set 1000 dollar hobbyist set minimal might apply sound engineer mastering official releases songs music artists

supporting world want live rational  d still microsoft s thumb  instead another big player  people nt dealt inconveniences sake building world wanted live  case  s even easier  comfort  technical wins price money  whereas another scenario one might live much inferior  expensive  product support choices 
ve used built headphones rift cv1s ve tried  like idea s quite convenient  s worth much frankly sound quality already better anyway  would use  probably  would pay much extra get option  nah 
felt burn    
nope  m perfectly happy volume knobs dac thanks

like video set ups  audio set ups levels diminishing returns  passing certain high end price  differentiation qualityvalue falls dramatically  example  7000 dollar oled 8k 70 inch lg tv saw best buy yesterday stunning video quality unlike ever seen  12000 dollar 70  8k oled samsung quantum dot samsung technology also looked stunning  difference two unnoticeable  d scrutinize hours close find perceptible difference  really think guy came 15000 dollar audio set  d notice major difference  even 10000 dollar difference  major difference  protip  wo nt  re past diminishing returns land  5400 set also well past diminishing returns land  never seem convince anyone diminishing returns land really  least experience  edit  m saying argument das headset equitable 15 dollar pair wrong  m saying  argument value ironic spending levels money set exceeds value 
re really one thread coming across irrational fanboy  might expect  s convincing 
 re hardcore douchebag  might explain love zuckerberg  alpha douchebag  think re somehow making compelling arguments swaying anyone  let assure  re 
hahahaha
seem working presumption s linear line increased audio quality past point due price  experience  s  audio quality  outside professional use  subjective  setup costs much pumping money made sound objectively better specific sound profile looking s combination equipment provides  example  could take system cost mine uses tubes open back design hear  major difference  two sets  aside  samsung nt make oled  makes qled totally different competing style tech  primary difference oled capable producing actual blacks pixel literally turns  qled form led fundamentally backlit  means youlll never true actual blacks  see difference  simply load image real black  protip  never buy television based looks like best buy unless living room also best buy

comfort headstrap much improved relieves pressured hmd face  headphones m buying really nice extra wires fiddle around headphones wan na play vr  apparently great quality sound top s totally worth price 
headphones attached  dangle cords  headphones reportedly pretty damn good quality  importantly attached new rigid padded strap accounts turns vive least comfortable comfortable hmd
ca nt speak particular headphones  general nt get good sound drivers less  100 
half dozen headphones well  100  need  work audio  could argued need work  nobody  needs  headphones true sense word  food  water  air  shelter  essential  5  500  word re looking  want   personally  want deluxe audio strap  think would get enjoyment  could waste money someone else  could nt care less enjoyment perceived others  buy things want life  realistically afford   nt sweat people think  also  nt sweat things think waste money others find value  maybe s  maybe re missing point

 aware report regarding foam deluxe audio headstrap  investigating  let know info  https  twittercomhtcvivestatus872520759989616640
got new headstrap 2 weeks ago playing thrill fight almost every day since getting  deterioration whatsoever hope stay way 
mine since two weeks also demoed 5 people 2 hours playtime  noticed deterioration far 
 deleted 
ve mine 2 weeks  ve played sweaty games  noticed anything yet  regarding checking  one thing m going  rub repeatedly one spot foam comes away lol
issues ve said  strap looks almost unused even though ve used regularly past week days  apart fact removed headphones foam little place putting back 
received mine last wednesday put like 10 hours vr since  signs degradation whatsoever thus far  hope holds well 
got  rubbed foam thumb bit  bits came  top despite careful hdmi cable seems wonky  moving around bit goes working green dots screen  grrrrr
would love people vote send htc get answer  issue simply ca nt go unnoticed  especially £100 product 
mine s coming tonight ll save post vote accordingly 
reason happening chose go condensed foam  oil s sweat mixed together person s head hair causing deterioration foam  also caused friction putting hmd removing hmd person s head  htc thought  instead never choose take consideration humans naturally secrete oils sweat body  went pleather another type material cover foam keep deteriorating 
mine played 1213 hours  sign deterioration 
m definitely holding buying know  sadly seems like might rushed product 
oh wow  30100 votes  yes   would legitimate quality control issue 10   30  s critical failure  suspect number increase run poll  initial month breakin testing 
got mine headset last night  loving far ll wait poll 
well  shit  first ve heard issue  ve mine one day  deterioration far  update notice anything  upside  seems like something nt   hard diy fix  still pretty alarming 
m sorta glad card got declined preorder
nope still early 
mine nt seem deteriorating rubbing foam  ca nt use however    issue old strap wo nt click one side vive  nt want rip like others break connectors  m stuck using das paperweight 
poll  biased information  anybody vote  matter even owns das 
got mine yesterday  nt notice deterioration  keeping eye though  edit  tested rubbing foam pressure slightly damp finger  small amount black residue came  nothing would consider  deteriorating  yet 
60 votes yes nearly 70   fuck glad nt spend  200au one
people saying  yes  bald sweaty  serious question 
mine comes friday rub test take poll 
got mine  going check soon  probably tomorrow  working late tonight 
got mine yesterday  played audioshield bit  nt notice anything wrong  nt long enough vote yes thing  ll see happens 
mine two weeks far nothing wrong witht foam  ve probably logged 100 hours thing already first half last week ac went still nothing  hair also medium length maybe could preventing head sweat reaching foam   idk
nt notice deterioration playing 30 mins jumbotron  mild sweat   bald nt think sweat got das foam  however  morning  reading thread  rub foam finger seconds  see shavings  guess nt rub furiously get wet  fine 
wonder s region specific issue 
one else exact issue face padding headset  first couple times kids played black outlines face padding  well  stopped happening first times 
mine came  ll report day two still near top  want say wearing significant improvement convenience needing think taking headset first  added comfort rigidity headstrap needing tight stay head  needing eventually replace foam padding nt something would stop buying 
got mine box  brief gentle fingernail scratching produced flakesparticles  ll see fares normal use  definitely seems like right conditions would make start shed 
concerned  foam back head clearly designed able easily replaced attached velcro  alignment tabs well  wether htc replaces third party  options future  though obviously may cost  
wow  34   total recall   excuse pun 
received mine yesterday  lot sweating far  rub fingers somewhat firmly   per somewhere comments   nt residue come  voted 
foam replaceable   could really expensive htc case  foam replaced however could ship new replacement foams instead replacing entire headstrap 
maybe check back week  ve put hours s nonactive racing games top  plan lot active vring week  superhot fruit ninja maybe    vote may end  yes   still 
m sure nt many consider solution m weighing issue  ordered strap  amazon s delivery date updated june 21st friday    actually offering opinion whether foam problematic anything  whenever stuff vr extended periods  cardio circuit weighted clothing  know get sweaty  wear one awesome sweatbands  https  smileamazoncomgpproductb00q6hl0x2refohauisearchdetailpage  ieutf8  psc1 generally helps comfort may may assist issue  putting 
played audioshield twenty minutes got foam soaked hairsweat  s  particularly  crumbly  rub little firmly  definitely start come  sure d see normal use  yet see issue foam dries  whether remain weakened  fyi  part first uk batch  case turns regional issue 
nt used enough see nt noticed deteriation yet  anyone else experienced position audio things new strap  bridge crew turn head hear correct position audio  m facing straight sounds like everything mile away  trying figure fix 
played soundboxing hour nt appear deteriorating  quick finger rub wet portion take material  preorder ms 
yes  observed problem 15 minutes beginning first use  
received mine today fitted  given serious usage yet  give vigorous rubbing  also known said  slightly damp finger foam getting slight bit transfer finger barely noticeable really  honest think blown little proportion somewhat  doubt normal usage ll get much rubbing like although leaving loosely tightened might make worse re throwing head around lot test fit  foam like stock gasket foam  s far softer finer  plush  guess would call almost like s got kind feltlike texture  mind would naturally shed little bit first like anything soft fluffy  see floor buy new socks first month  towel bathroom  d expect initial loose fibers lost would nt become long term problem slowly wearing foam away significant degree  think sake reasonable doubt d wait month two usage becoming annoyed  know s £100 accessory people little agitated even start nt expect htc defy basic properties fluffy materials  said sound quality headphones amazing  impressed part s objectively way comfortable already  tl  dr think s happening mine little bit m still happy camper 
mine time e3 inevitable fallout 4 vr demo everyone get download play  ಠಠ hopefully caused via alien acid sweat  vr setup finished basement temperatures low summer  due ac  need wear slippers  still  nt happening 
well 20 hours w strap  nothin yet  havent played anything like sairento raw data yet w would make really sweat  dont think wear tear issue sweat issue cuz havent sweating much thing since got 
got mine least night  ll find soon  m least happy see padding replaceable  though 
used mine three hours straight nt notice  look   ll check tonight 
could reaction hair products perhaps 
used hours nt problems  think money well spent s much better using vive old strap 
wonder tightly vive secured head  loosely held might shift head swings side side  constant shifting may cause rub away  theory though  matter making tight could make worse 
strawpoll vote manipulation  numbers votes goes dramatically  disregard poll many new das instead many vote want believe without even owning 
yeah  ve used mine 30 minutes yesterday  probably wo nt get serious vr session next sunday  even  might sweat 
 deleted 
nt think matters nt issue  1  users problem s big deal 
also rubbed shit  even damp fingers  far good  actually use vive report back  voted yet 
attached via velcro something easily replaceable  would make recalls lot easier 
upvotes please  super happy responding already  let s hope take correct stance consumers 
imo  better test  may ask ordered 
seems like quality foam vary lot  definitely looks like s quality control issues
brother wiped back head noticed  rag came away covered black powder  issue rubbing strap unusual way sadly  
3 1 got horrendous kink somehow  m going buy backup 
get rub finger pressure one place 20 times simulate taking offon  making move wear  often shoud instanly see black finger  nothing sweat 
taken year get released  s anything rushed  nt think properly tested foam  assumed would fine 
s entirely possible percentage units manufacturing flaw foam  would explain seemingly majority people nt problem good amount still 
customers problem probably likely come vote 
vinyl electrical tape ftw
lot people nt issue seems random
nt gotten old strap yet  try rotating connector  upwards   made easier remove old strap 
true  know yellow turd guy gon na vote hundred times like troll 
considering got yesterday getting residue would 100  call deterioration 
70   yes   p
would never spend  200 something realistically nt value  50 
""
nope never heard 
thoughts exactly  
really want thing suck nt
time writing  post 48 views  poll 11 votes edit  s 111 views 13 votes
thinks s obligatory everything say gets downvoted  except one random time last week actually made valid comment  think shocked us 
 also  remember poll nt evidence  yes  s proof  user testimony certainly evidence 
least  people talking  htc would likely offer fix affected users 
thats true 99  though  dont care 1  finally get experience tuff times 
held velcro yes  would nt hard send replacements people 
yeah mostly nt immediately contact support demand refund  even sheds still improvement  comes pretty easy  ll see couple days plays guess 
better test  use virzoom watching shows big screen sweat like crazy  get das tomorrow  happens going back
alternatede
would nt jump conclusion foam varying quality one headset another  would logically go direction foam people different   people sweat differently  people wear headset differently cranking tight loose creating varying amounts pressure  played hours count mean sitting vs standing  active vs inactive games  long sessions vs many short sessions  long term contact head vs onoff headset   course hair vs soft hair  short prickly hair vs long hair  hair products vs hair products  humid environments feel combination bullet points cause 
seems lot vids people scratching padding atm  m sure s good test nt noticed anything brother  sure  notice s leaving bits hairhead  give light rub  s deteriorating ll become apparent easily  shame though going case everyone  promising product something simple overlooked  😕
nt happen mine oo
also add friction rubbing nothing like taking 
seems like nt test issue like show already early release  looking forward ordering one wait  used thinner version material used american football helmet hockey helmet  material decades testing 
took year released nt mean nt rushed  could rushed development testing taken forever manufacturing side  anything foam indication rushed door 
get whole playing devils advocate thing  literally started shipping mass quantities consumers  nt enough time know yet  therefore reason rush buy 
nt matter  nt even seeing anything near 30 people even get device right 
nt get wrong m jealous  wish nt miss plan   m little less sore
well  like said  small  meaning could possibly loose fibers left surface manufacturing process  aka   flocking   https  enwikipediaorgwikiflocking  texture     time tell guess 
oh must read wrong lol  still 30  pretty high sorta product 
spend money star citizen 
well im spending like  500 au wireless kit imported taobao china lol wanted extra comfort fact spot adapter  might wait revolve use 
 s wrong either  even people want succeed  honestly  think early poll anyways  would nt expect many people experience degradation owning day two  said  happening even headsets cause concern 
s orgasm news  http  imgurcoma97tfg
might early poll people received yesterday today degradation likely take multiple hours playtime  maybe include playtime poll  mines arriving today m firmly holding small issue straps  fingers crossed 
provide picture one yes  30   pictures  hard take picture upload days 
 deleted 
something tells wont send replacements  would surprised considering htc track record 
boxing lot head movement quick lateral shifts though  sweat  friction 
variations tested  
likely tied natural oils people s hair  people naturally oily hair likely suffer worse foam degradation 
true  nt considered  someone quality tested multiple seperate deluxe audio straps side side could find 
coud realy part products problems ll see month
yeah  honestly excuse book  like said plenty tested foam products  supplier provided warning understanding product potential issues  m headed  rpitchforkemporium   https  wwwredditcomrpitchforkemporium  
maybe  point nt necessarily mean rushed product 
hopefully s nothing significant  sucks affected though  interesting see deterioration issue develops 
think need another parentheses end hyperlink btw 
yeah definitely worrying  mine seems fine far got yesterday 
votes nt seem right comments
spent star citizen feel s value  piece cheap ass plastic cheap headphones  200 value

re getting voted agree  htc absolutely terrible customer support rules screw customers save company money whenever possible 
nt really think blaming people s happening  saying issue foam severity varies lot people  think due environmental factors 
oh  sure  pointing right bat assume foams different depending headset 
went back looked could swore put oily hair vs non oily missed one despite one top predictions  typing quick boss nt looking 
issue widespread  htc ignore sell replacement pads  30  likely material degrades  admit fault  hell might say liquid damage  getting headstrap wet voids warranty  lol

m waiting amazon get stock  money ready refresh page 3x per day
das delivered far people simply using without commenting  usually answer  s human condition  people tend complain unsatisfied  contenthappy people nt share often  ratio 110  activeextrovert get good product expectations exceeded big margine  become called  promoter   big companies actively working creating moments  identify nurture promoters  get customers board   s promoters like sound trompets something really good happens  people like make youtube videos  reddit posts reviews  simply rare   work customer support see effect every day

initially disappointed comfort deluxe audio strap already able use thin face cover relatively comfortably welding mask headgear mod   link face cover m using  prefer 6mm vr cover one   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments4gezog8sleepmaskmodworkedbetterthanexpectedand modding s result  http  imgurcomabnd7i really surprised find even thin face cover s actually comfortable use original one default face cover  also  testing face covers different thickness levels  noticed works better thinner ones  re glasses user need use thicker face cover  modification wo nt probably useful

totally agree  weight distribution  ease use builtin earphones combined make difference  used get uncomfortable playing one hour easily play 3 without slightest discomfort  used combine vive quite expensive overear headphones obviously superiour sound however audio certainly nt bad using das builtin earphones comfort far outweighs anyway  even putting hmd head goes much smoother though seems like minor thing  ve started using vive way often quick sessions 
would consider getting deluxe audio straps vive  using noise cancelling headphones probably wait put money buying knuckles instead 
m glad someone happy thier purchase  right side mine already slips sometimes hmd sitting face crooked  left side makes creeking noise even smallest movement  dial back feels likes going bust day  like 15 hours strap baby thing  510 way fucking expensive got  honestly feel like 20  headstrap using  even hours hours adjusting thing still feel like s amount pressure face original strap

 deleted 
considering fact s stock  guess trouble keeping order  whatever reason  also deluxe audio straps cost reason  doubt want vive even greater barrier entry  lastly  deluxe audio straps  evidently  uncomfortable people prefer basic straps  believe   anyway  basic straps actually pretty good  nt material box instruct people properly put  leading front heavy discomfort 
would love get hold one 
ordered ago   still waiting    https  staticcarthrottlecomworkspaceuploadsposts2015106ed732468f5740df9b4cac3996a3bd0ajpg

friggin strap monitor like priced  insanely expensive 
 tpcast way teach secrets 
got curious  posting  straw poll   http  wwwstrawpollme13359681r  thread 
situation well  d like new headphones  nt care comfort factor  strap fine  audio strap  knuckles  wireless  audio strap comes distant 3rd place two 
hmmm  public demos got das  actually thinking might switch back original strap demo days  kind keep das pristine  thoughts  much easier fit  experience day running constant demos original strap takes seconds fit 
depends felt pressure  eg  pressure forehead  try loosen top strap bit  maybe initially tried keep weight completely back head  forehead feels fine initially  let feel bad weight distribution 
yeah got lens inserts das time loving vive ever  much easier get quickly  especially without hassles getting glasses lined correctly using lot  worthwhile upgrades   say  thinking tpcast 
sorta agree  honestly price paid das feel expensive  right side already slips 15 hours use hear creeking noise coming left side louder headphones  dial back also feels cheap  though comfort bit better s like actually takes pressure cheeks  ve spent hour hours adjusting difference feel rigid back  510 expensive cheap thing feels 
agree sentiment  got mine  30 pocket  newegg rebate money needed spent   worth  price  since m developing game moment  das actually harder deal old strap putting headset taking often  pure gaming  das worth price  nt enough 
d wait  s already overpriced original price 
waiting  ca nt much longer think fixing whatever people problems foam
go store tell sell 100  markup  p d buy reason alone  
ordered russian store well  receive one tomorrow  could tell selling first version  fixed one

never actually deteriorated  read threads beyond initial alarmist review  ll see foam residue rubbing  probably left foam cutting   das none  part preorder  m guessing nt many straps affected begin  still  affected straps replaced cause wants crap hair spending  100  nt affect 
  hard get hold one austria  gday moit  poeslawwebm
keep mind detach earphones still use get mounting benefits 
bose q35  noise cancelling  bluetooth wireless  tried oculus s headphones sound great  simply lay top ears provide isolation  s one reasons ve holding das  noise cancelling makes get completely lost game 
convenience wins hands  also  immersion good concept  prefer hear people outside vr  completely cut outside world 
make version headphones  
detach  seriously doubt majority consumers prefers separate headphones 
youre going fit regular headphones comfortably wo nt cover ears properly  re audiophile expensive sennheisers whatever re gon na mind 5  ll save cost changing factories mess getting another product logistics chain entails

re talking padding leaving black residue  nt issue far  used strap 8 hours total though 
unfortunately strap sold separately 
ok thanks clarifying  pissed came across  299 price  wait come back stock  99

https  youtubexyz6n7mpb0

might negate nose cancelling benefits  since strap prevent cups getting good seal head 
answer lookinghoping  thanks

tough companies make multiple skus essentially product  decrease cost omitting headphones would probably worth increase cost packaging stocking two different units 
use speakers  great sound system takes lot weight head  way comfortable  hot  yes  s directional  problem hearing stereo even m turned around  etc  hate using headphones vive 
would  tactile transducer headphones enclose ear  really feels nice head shaking  
simply two items product page  like amazon page  good wireless headset  nt need additional headphones  vive better rigid easy put strap would instantly make putting extra headphones much quicker easier   deluxe audio strap   9999  deluxe head strap   5999  6999

yep could also give options 
actually new strap makes feel less heavy better weight distribution 
dont know  havent got yet  report back picked

 though s bit overpriced despite currently sold 
ultimately  bought vive craigslist pristine condition 550 tripods sensors original packaging  figure could turn around right sell  new headset comes soon  probably wo nt lose much  m probably going drop 100 accessories  except knuckles   generally add nothing resale  even great  sounds like totally worthwhile upgrade  hope comes standard 2nd gen vive headsets 
steamvr intermittently forget audio settings 
able find pattern cause  steamvr intermittently forgets audio settings  work fine one time  next time start steamvr  default audio device changed  sound  must go settings choose correct device  happens often  every time  anybody else problem  known solution  s big problem  annoying times  note  using beta version 
s whenever device disconnected  sometimes randomly hdmi windows hate  device gets new name reconnects  causes steamvr windows forgot settings previous connection  s bloody fucking annoying 
yup   random resetting audio settings  cure know 
thought  ve filed issue  https  githubcomvalvesoftwareopenvrissues632
controllers scrolling menus drive mad  fixed  problem since day one
yeah
 wish would fix  steam vr around long still issues like 
yeah  swear s every time steamvr updates  tempting plug headphone jack done 
happens  s super frustrating take hmd fix audio settings restart game  
fixed  even device disconnected reenumerated another name valve needs write something detects situation chooses previous settings new device  make optional  m certain doable 
""
m also annoyed vive microphone always prioritized automatically used even set different microphone play games  quick fix disconnect vive  usb  s annoying 
happen well time time  nt know beta opted  opted mention though  think ca nt find configured audio device launch right away blanks setting  never happens microphone  reverting back either mic audio 
glad know s 
one constant problem since beginning 
wanted come say ve issue 
valve fixes issue  recommend using  setsounddevice   https  drivegooglecomopen  id0bya6o6cfldic0k4bjzvwglqy0e   1 unzip ssdv4exezip 2 run file  3 click    create shortcut change playback device   button  4 drop menu appear  select device want create shortcut   ex  vive audio device  5 select icon want shortcut   ex  headphones vive audio  6 save shortcut desktop  7 choose ask wan open file location  8 audio devices typical use   use different icons one  9 close program finished creating shortcuts  10 go desktop drag shortcut taskbar  creates single click shortcuts taskbar audio device  change audio devices  needed single left click corresponding icon taskbar 
used happen lot  started using http  wwwvbaudiocomvoicemeeterbananahtm seems fixed issue also allows mirror sound  know steam vr  lets  mirror also pain rear  always use program even vr reasons 
going since vive release  though app general lot stable  one pisses pointer falls steamvr menu desktop tab re vr longer interact desktop vr  needs fixed user friendliness purposes 
valve    hey look new exciting thing made  well m bored  next new exciting thing   
plug mic like ps4 controller well  changes default output settings use new device thinks re trying use 
problem vive s hdmi sound setting  think caused device s name changing steamvr knowing audio device select  would indicate likely nvidia software problem randomly switching normal hdmi audio driver vive specific driver  able fix using usb audio instead  could causes 
yeah set go back normal speakers steam vr closes  works sometimes  seem reset somehow  maybe updates clear settings  im sure
""
additionally  launch vr game without explicitely launching steamvr beforehand  audio settings get ignored 
resets audio settings start steamvr audio device vr available  example forget plug wireless mic 
seems happen every time steam vr gets update 
 badly needs fixing 
oh yes  hate 
 valve please fix 
types issues solved unplugging headset reboots 
try dp cable
importantly  vive usb audio hdmi audio device  one works change randomly      
sooo frustrating  personally blame several different methods delivering audio headset  seems randomly change usb audio hdmi audio even dont want use either 
met problem  also headset  built mic  plugged well 
annoying  headset realizing sound set vive eventhough switch setting set steamvr 
usb headset tv connected pc  well vive  seems totally random one produces sound given time 
yeah  audio part steam vr shit 
sure noted yet   advanced settings   https  githubcommatzman666openvradvancedsettings  sound mic device settings audio tab  swap back without taking headset  used frustrating issue well 
steam vr option change audio device use  option switch back another device choosing closing 
may explain  try remember unplug power link box keep hmd getting hot use  ll test see direct correlation 
bad everything else remembers disconnected devices  including oculus home  s steamvr seems issue 
oculus home manages work time  steamvr nt  sure valve something better find correct headphones looking device exact name string 
think might onto something whole hdmi thing  nt experience trouble laptop  desktop  importantly  think  ca nt recall happening desktop lately switch monitors dp  m using hdmi ports anymore  dp   hey  maybe s worth try picking hdmi  dp cables monitors  provided enough dp ports  
use 51 speakers big 4k tv monitor  every often  usually gpu drivers update switch hdmi dp  switch using hdmi audio always makes new audio device   open list audio devices  shows via  spdif nt use  nine  nine disabled hdmi audio sources  s annoying bug
gets new name plug different usb port
well  least know s pc  hopefully  fix soon 
nt problem  maybe never kill power link box 
perfect solution  openvr advanced settings   https  githubcommatzman666openvradvancedsettings  nice option named  mirror audio   select prefered audio device  works switching  
usb device id priority fuckery windows 10 pretty much 
s right place file issue  openvr middleware  steamvr software 
mean hard select game  instead scrolls list 
use openvradvancedsettings  allows change device ingame lot nice features 
say complete earnest one issue holding back steam vr immensely  want show friends  hooked tv  walk back forth computer three times fuck settings screen ca nt properly use  s tv  s enough want pick vive start playing  s thing 
would nice habe like quicksettings chaning audio inputoutput devives prefered levels 
resets randomly  s issue
 deleted 
d thought 
necessarily  one headsets wireless  turn  even though wireless dongle connected port  audio settings messed  even turn back launching steamvr  long leave headset  nt happen  days  leave connected charging cable  plugged usb wall outlet  computer 
two devices  usb audio hdmi audio  hdmi name changes every time device powered unplugged hdmi port  sure usb audio nt use
s like year  would nt hold breath 
 hopefully  fix soon  perhaps make noise  still  people  including  complaining since day one results 
valve  really nt give shit imho  hands worst customer service company dealt  mostly monopoly reason care 
neither 
problem using mirror audio introduces latency audio stream  test playing something hear headphones speakers  notice headphones lagging behind speakers  games might matter  might 
wind using openvr advanced settings fix audio forgot device s supposed using  s convenient since s able used headset 
mirror setting resets mirror occasionally 
well alternative seems steam forum  suggest better place ll give go least github issue chance prompting response kind 
wheel plugged joystickspedals takes inputs makes menus unusable scrolling constantly
 deleted 
also would like know veracity i d assumed bug feature keep time 
bs unless provide kind source  keeping device hot constantly stressing electronics good idea 
going able find devices available launch steamvr  device unavailable tried access  would happen case nt accounted steam would probably crash attempting access unavailable device
 http  steamcommunitycomapp250820discussions3
even annoying
hi  s little program download called dashfix  s specifically problem describe allows use menus wheel plugged  works 
rift  assumption always prevent lenses fogging   higher surface temperature means less chance condensation   would great official source confirm though 
physics  dont source ve thought problem first principles  keeping warm garaunteed way prevent condensation fog put drives away moisture take 
physics  dont source ve thought problem first principles  keeping warm garaunteed way prevent condensation fog put drives away moisture take 
s common practice  car stereos  vive pretty good seal displays  moisture getting really fuck things
physics  dont source ve thought problem first principles  keeping warm garaunteed way prevent condensation fog put drives away moisture take 
yeah  meant  alternative seems steam forum    s hopeless try track bugs s way set status  merge close issues  s official way report bugs s fairly depressing  edit  s also http  steamvrcomnewticket s public unsatisfactory slightly different way  ve idea issue reported million times  worked marked wontfix  sigh 
right guess thats home electronics running warm whole time  making shit  stop 
made pretty sure  well done 
go feel power bricks  s heat  manufacturers move heat away unit  guarantee nt many things designed operate similar environments  ca nt conceive something nt make untrue  think almost electronics standby mode nowadays  instead straight onoff switch  warm  component electricity running generate  fine 
thanks 
  conceive something nt make true  power bricks get hot use  exactly would point hot use seeing would zero effect thing powering dispelling condensation  dont many things designed operate similar environments vive  ie  living room  sand modes exist takes time boot power electronics  s convenience  tv manufacturer nt advise turn tv wall moisture kill using phantom power  fix  honestly  claim sounds like utter bs  things sounded like utter bs proven true surprised perfectly happy accept m rick nt know everything  offer sources proof please

seriously  lots loyal fans yet transparent  tell us order  really hard 
apparently  s good  afaik people could try show floors  always suboptimal  open vs closed earphones muchdiscussed subject  usually  open headphones  get much wider soundstage  basically means get better directional audio  hear better direction sound coming  also far away  virtual  sound source  biggest con  hear sound real surroundings  also get less bass  immersion better  nt loud home 
nt  paypal  charge paypal account  saved lot people ordering vive nt get hold subsequently auto cancel 24 hours later charge  though  100 purchase nt issue

several reasons   first time early adopters bit bored like trz new things  list example   think norman tested found really good big comfort improvement  easily quickly pull headset similar psvr  people might like ear headphone solutio
spoken like someone extremely uninformed  even bothering simple google search find  s kinda unsurprising person nt understand something ve looked literally 
yes want new strap  s welcome upgrade  nt need headphones  especially seem wayyy open  onear   still enjoy earphones included  120€  thanks    might tolerate psychological price 99€ m feeling prudent  early adopter really nt feel like paying big amount upgrade going release next 912 months   120€ deluxe strap  250€ tpcast wireless  250€ chinese eyetracking device way re going running headset tpcast battery ll eyetracking addon  battery life going drain least 10  faster  
nt bothered original straps vive first  probably amazed actual vr experience   year use  really annoys every time put  s hard put take comfortable way  including inear headphones   s also pain adjust ve got people try vr  also psvr  compared vive  feels like putting cap  new strap vive shipped start 
nt  hate  default strap  tendency slip forwarddown time head  probably exacerbated large hair  rigid strap ought alleviate  also hmd presses cheekbones bit hopefully das also help better weight distribution 
want wireless d expect interested  nt even want imagine would like deal wireless attachment current strap

age imparts patience general suppose  re 2  waiting hour using significant portion life  re 60  hour far less percentage total experienced time 
 day company revealed vive tracker preorder date  also tweeted preorders deluxe audio head strap would start may 2 curiously  plans changed  reason  vive ’ preorder cycle deluxe audio head strap anymore   though  perhaps s microsoft jumped gun started offering preorders last week   instead opening preorders today  vive announced “ starting june 6  ” purchase vive deluxe audio strap  state preorders start june 6th says ditched preorders altogether able purchase outright june 6th 
still right  contextually  preorder changed purposes consumers sub reader comment  also matters although much delivery date 
guess glad able get preorder microsoft  need wait screw 
s really nice bot 
nt think s correct say respective apis main things people rallied behind owners see vive merely means steamvr end  anything facebook politics would next line behind hardware terms polarising factors 
fair enough  certainly launch issues m sure rma sitch improved  would asus someone else better  knows  think many stick know could certainly wrong 
yep  saw new thread replying  indeed mean old thread  sorry confusion 
dang  sucks 
one came online today  people preordered nt canceled yet  also got delivery estimates around midmay  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments68s6ptgermanypreorderyourdeluxeaudiostrapnowdh0uwrw
questioned people hyped  got answer  s strap people rift hmd vive hmd  yet differences minusplus leads see benefit owning one prefer  difference  obviously extras new audio strap provides sufficient others  move forward  nothing see 
depends good headphones   99 good pair headphones nt exorbitant  sucks ca nt get strap without headphones less money  s like money   buying strap 
works fine    let people want want 
plus young people generally selfish  re still learning whole world nt revolve around  young people get upset  ll see time  wait   
really glad nabbed ms preorder 
possibly fathom anything changed anyone regarding  way could someone able preorder yesterday longer able order june 6th  mean re flat wrong  re demanding full specifics ignoring implications s human communication works 
facebook s privacy policies eula install oculus home  lost ton goodwill
worries  still nt know actually canceled  especially midmay way sooner date htc posted blog post 
 one last week 
subreddit supposed echo chamber dissenting opinions allowed  m met hostility simple post 
mean  m gon na order june 6th probably get time 
turns  may 2nd june 6th day  preordering may 2nd ordering june 6th also   thing  really sure hard concept understand 
statement nt contribute form conversation  s tiring

51 energy speakers tactile subwoofer chair  subpac2   cockpit  setup would loved strap without headphones  waste money

option devices menu steam vr force wake basestations  sure well works though  one base station takes 15 seconds turn usually takes closer 60 seconds  idea
ordered one newegg  free  5 3day shipping  much cheaper compared htcs  20 shipping 
use earbuds  hate fiddling  right left  caught  wo nt reach  also keeping clean  guests want try  ll look openvr though  thank advice
obviously sound worse  trade convenience  understand use dt990s  act bringing headphone takes away ease use  toss vive  ’ leave hd800s desk  ’ much simpler  know sound worse ease use much better  mention social environment need make sure people ’ whip headphones onto ground 
ve got bunch headphones  das ones certainly nt worst  re best  either  definitely work fine re made 
headphones  logitech almost never listed sites ve checked best headphones  purchasing 
one favorite features  hmd sits bouncy spring like fitting end easily lift place  also good holding using real world 
reference  people say 3in1 cable mean  new cable   https  wwwamazoncomhtcvive31cablepcdpb01mqw49b3  twisted together whatever  one sheath 
believe mean usually wear side  straps  horizontal instead angled upward  like picture 
got mine today 
ca nt figure actually buy microsoft store  button add cart  https  wwwmicrosoftcomencastoredhtcvivedeluxeaudiostrap8wz5cwh91s0q
sweet  worked  thanks

option pay headphones 
headphone amp plug  manage vr 
s hard justify selling  100 without  hitech  component  htc probably intense marketing research decided everyone needs attached headphones  
trained idiot turn screw    take em  probably  5 worth material  thats mine 
wait  nt even touch ears  sort nonsense  read uroothorick s comment  s comment audiophile  m quality  comfort immersionphile  nt audiophile nice headphones  nt xphile want use something ve already paid 
would nt want cockpit setup anyway dial back head
non headphone version would maybe  90  plastic small speakers expensive   100 price tag recoup r  costs small install base 
s absolutely overpriced  charging 120 eur piece plastic outrageous  like das nt mean s worth price  mean  costs almost 13 discounted rift touch controllers  wtf
ordered amazon credits saved  got 2 day shipping preselling stock wont get delivered till aug 1st  
meant well stuff  autocorrect  s good tool  also use audioswitcher program hotkeys 
woooooord
ha  nt know even option  guess d better take look settings get home  mine sit glowing time 
yeah work sometimes  always  sometimes s stuck  ll try someone else said  unplugging troublesome basestation  though one hard reach plug 
thanks man  sadly watching amazon page come back stock 
b  h photo free 2 day shipping 
feed straps  s guide somewhere optimal setup resolved complaints 
definitely feed along front display  straps  always dangle next ears  problem  figuring left right untangling  pop lifting headset  reason nt want use use pc speakers  loop straps another time  videos examples  main downside still sharing earbuds great guests  re back cans extra wires etc  s builtin das audio helpful  fiddling earbud cables time main struggle  s easily solved 
das headphones compare say pair koss portapros 
ah  thanks 
exactly makingsandwich said  straps horizontal feels natural  wearing like guy picture s little tighter maybe little lesser pressure forehead  nt really final position yet 
m reasonably sure means stock  watched page amazonca months  waiting das available  looked like  ie  greyed button  actually able buy 
np  looking one ve got one order 
d say put ebay  m sure someone broken already 
yeah find someone broke s buy cheap  remove broken headphones via snap inout thing videos show mod  re fine 
jumping say s built amp headset headphones plug  headphones normally paired dac work well  use akg k702 s work nicely  audiophiles still care sound vr  genuinely interested
well specifically cheaper version wo audio  also protrusions plastic removing headsets ideally would nt get way noaudio version 
 wait  nt even touch ears  sort nonsense  well  re attached little arms sides strap  held place friction joint slide arms  stay place whether re touching ears  normal use ll properly   ears though  without pressure 
finally get das  head far enough away s ok problems 
 well  s nice know option 
yeah back first launched issue never actually turning  disabled feature got fixed well  forgot decided leave em way haha 
power strips switches probably worth case  ve got remote controlled power thing meant lamps would work well  probably nt want spend  20 avoid walking flipping switch https  wwwamazoncoms  urlsearchalias  3daps  fieldkeywordsremoteoutlet
np  thing since prime handy newegg decent alternative
ah damn  placed order lunch break already
ve never actually used  although koss made headphones oculus  right 
yup stock check chat lady  little misleading  stock button  grayed  ordered one bhphotovideo instead 
definitely  clarity soundstage  massive  effects immersion  said  subjective difference   das favored kns6400s vive s integrated dac amp pretty small  kns definitely sound better little bit eq compensate weak low end  s capability vive hardware  eq difficult software without introducing latency  m sure hell gon na run second tether 302usb 
care  nt like dealing extra wires  purchasing ultrashort audio cables good compromise  still  nt tried old method new das  look  still circular protrusion remain builtin headphones removed  seems like would interfere top pad larger cans  builtin headphones okay  dt990 pros nt hold candle  still  builtins ultra convenient 
das audio sounds perfectly fine probably users  still get full stereo surround nt sound  canned  bad issues 
s built amp vive headset  know  funny mention akg k702s  looking maybe purchasing since someone stole sennheiser 380pros   like 
point dont think really put much  speakers  stupid cheap get passable drivers headphones  version wo audio would likely still  90 
s cockpit without headrest  haveuse one 
find bit buggy  need wipe keybinds reconfigure every 24 weeks  would great could save backup config reload starts fail  still  s great free product 
thanks  finally sprung  excited try 
k702 expensive audio purchase ca nt compare higher end  highly comfortable works well vive  nt das  good range sound bass nt overpower louder segments  would recommend thoroughly felt provided value far asking price  d get shorter mini xlr 35 buy today length default cable little awkward  fuck people stole headphones 
never  always using vive  nt rest head anything 
yeah   used autohotkey  could never quite get script right 
buddy  m ready bit easier time getting situated people trying lol 
haha yeah tried autohotkey dodgy chinese xbox 360 wireless receiver  unplugged usb  reinstall change driver automatically selected older version  default windows one would nt work 3rd party ones  enough bought xbox one adapter controller  problem solved 
totally  adjusting various head sizes actually reasonably thing  previously risked dropping whole device required two hands

bundle new cable new strap  mess

quick reminder everyone complaining  nt yet know intended mention actual release  far m concerned alternatede shipments jumping gun nt meant get yet  preorders meant open   may well announce release properly mention new cable required  also  believe say broke allocate one free replacement cable per headset  nt hold though  something someone said  possibly worth shot though 
matter goes top  looks fine
one idea would putting velcro  https  iimgurcomxzs30ygjpg another idea would getting extra velcro straps  like  http  iimgurcomn7peedpjpg

think turn right lot like zoolander lol lot without even thinking headset cable ends looking like 90 s corded phone  really bad right turns holopoint always try unwind put away try let cable loosly fall wants putting away long drawer 
bought cable 6 months ago even basically guaranteed d get new one  nt think ve heard anyone getting old one since like october  waited order felt confident d get new one 
ve 
feeling would case  get dah delivered tomorrow  m still using old cable  find solution ll let know  sure looks like put thought functionality old cable  besides width first guide side 
 steelseries siberia 840 wow   350   pricey  d always assume cans price range would beat audio solutions integrated headstrap 
likely lot bass  gaming headsets 
hmm  glad tpcast way guess
feeling  running cable top  would put weight top head  would make less comfortable 
kabel   cabel sorry typical german error lol
yes  exactly like mine  old headstrap locked position two sides connects hmd  man  heavy explain english  d ok  seems free rotateable new strap 
preordered  ll happy soon receive 
ah  ll see whether bothers center foam get strap  unfortunately amazonca nt shipping early ll wait weeks june 
use openvr advanced settings  twist counter  need turn n times opposite direction voila  cable untangled  works wonders avid raw data player   end  wireless ultimate answer 
forget loyal  oculus users biggest masochists around  way oculus treated last 18mths without repercussions astounding 
owns rift nt mean s wrong  fanboy 
s pretty leery logic  first  nt get people bitch prices come bought product  entitlement palatable  guess prefer prices never come  secondly  means overall paying close  300  compared current rift pricing  system  finally  almost identical comfort head mount  although new vive mount look slightly durable   nt really see logical basis complaint 
arguing alt account 
 cable also touches back old strap different feels ll see  m one   although u feel teh cable back    https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments6d3sbbgotthedeluxeaudiostrapfromalternatetoday 
nt want spend  200 wireless   wireless nt help comfortabilityergonomics headset d still want new headstrap regardless 
ok  opinion s worth buying new cable also audio strap  right  guess s ll  frankenvive getting pricey 
yeah m really wanting spare cable even new cable get headstrap  hopefully somewhere else start supplying vive accessories uk soon  scan going stocking head straps s step right direction 
hehe  m vr ambiturner  every match pavlov  racket nx  onward  turn right unwind  lol   popped link box 
s good know  ll order new cable order deluxe 
solution orderd new cable  get new one came got mixed reviews twisting faster reason 
payed 220€   wirless   hotswap batteries stay wirless nonstop  also option use phone via bluetooth mic  steelseries siberia 800 without bluetooth still wirless
 glad tpcast way guess    stop  urge order one well getting strong 
d get 
yeah  could true  one way alleviate would give slack routing lower velcro band  similarly old headstrap   least new cable notice difference weight route cable side vs top new deluxe headstrap 
nt see problem since pressed around head save  think needs able rotate take vive easy 
think way easier lift hmd  wearing head 
yellowturd comments negatively look post history think response 
owns rift time s play part antivive concern troll  defend call fanboy calling  fuck 
owning rift making absurb comments vive means s fanboy though 
  nt really see logical basis complaint  ballparked lower amount  released higher amount could nt even launch properly  first launch  claimed selling cost  teardown proves otherwise  9mths paper launch discount hmd  3mths even discount touch whopping 50   much selling cost  issue  another lie add pepperidge farms list 
course prices go  bought 1080ti weeks s already 100€ less paid  disappointed   expecting willing pay could wait longer  hand  one expected rift s price go much soon  marketing move oculus  could solely due facebook money  counter low sales losing market space vive  process screwing oculus rift cv1 early adopters    wrote   personal opinion  would pissed bought rift launch  fail see logic second point  wanted vive  ca nt bothered list 100th time reasons prefer rift  willing pay   knew since day one  surprises 
nt think alt  uorangediarrhealarge looks like someone made account specifically heckling uyellowturdbig  kinda funny imo
m shure yet  orderd new cable test 
would love see accessories really want couple controllers back ups charge play  way paying 300 quid pair  make sure keep top charging 
think point s misleading comparison  perhaps least mention re comparing op  surely know anyone reads comment subconsciously picture current headphones compare without knowing context comparison 
taobao  waiting patiently 
thought  also wanted sure don´t damaged something changing strap  press realy heavy new straps clicks  thanks   
well many people oculus sub point negatives  point valid concerns nt get hated  sirviver better turd 
fanboy  htc shitty   please fuck 
see  dont see m screwed price drop  maybe happened days d annoyed  though item bought months back made cheaper impacts way  basically feeling entitled buy product  compensated changes price later  choosing vive good idea many reasons  mostly comfort glasses  however  ca nt really recommend people fit rift comfortably  price drop pushed edge imho  tell people try days pick comfortable 
lolwut  1080ti nt price drop  unless got impatient bought one 3rd party scalps 
basically keep ebay page open refresh every several times day  seems like best way getting things moment  managed pick spare controller mixed reality £70  s year though hopefully least amazon get together soon 
well shoud compare inears come vive  comparing sound individual opinion anyway 
aww  said  please   re polite troll ve ever met   
expect price drop soon  honestly nt believe  s oculus  backed fb money  used trade dumping like tactics try get edge vive lauch go well  customer could make informed decision  buy earlier accept higher price  wait months buy cheaper  nt expecting  s said early buyers screwed  m going argue recommendation  everyone entitled opinion  people like apple  prefer orange android  people like facebook see nothing wrong zuckenberg  others  people like seated sim games  others like roomscale  lots reasons one would choose one  would buy oculus even current price  would bought original  ball park  price  actually finger waiting preorder page saw actual price  talk disappointed expectations 
amazon  direct  third party seller   ordered became widely available 
 well shoud compare inears come vive  compare   steelseries siberia 840   350 set cans  sigh
pointing talking shit considered trolling 
m glad see prices come ttt  wish vive would drop price  start bundling new headstrap etc  remember initial disappointment disbelief price  sitting cold 4am  took 3 goes get balls buy  even though first batch  vive ordered afterwards still got first  vive good head start really controllers room scale  s shame pretty much squandered allowed oculus catch 
 30 sennheiser hd 201 sound better 
 continued poor attempts make considered trolling  re done 
htc said start vive would premium experience  would reflected price  still adhering initial vision  premium vr device  giving complete experience still modular  s oculus constantly changed policies  messed 
mentioned earlier  seems like re making shit
tried make turd  ridiculous

htc working closely  tpcast announced website  funded project  etc  know 
m guessing part htc s acceleratorincubator  tell knew 
 deleted 
m going remain cautiously optimistic tpcast 
d prefer newtype hand controllers showed last year  d keep old ones spare trackers  really holding breath  though 
dang forgot  since already 1080 fe nt expect 1080ti bring enough extra table make worth upgrade  ll keeping eye performance reports case 
request vive tracker dev  https  wwwvivecomustrackerform

considering  btw 19 hours left kickstarter   deluxe strap really comes april  probably revolve  considering still independent reviews revolve  asked  among  realitycheck make review  one less reliable sources vr  confirmed videos roomscale rift   think ll pass possibly reconsider ordering one later time  flip function interesting   edit  saw thread  looks like listened thankfully reconsidered reviewers  choice  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments5suigrrevolvereviewunitssenttonathie
going first party  tbh
like everybody else  m waiting reviews revolve  maybe money back guarantee  otherwise ll purchase new strap htc 
likely  wireless solution built vive 20 
expect around 200euros
ll shocked s anywhere  100  m expecting  150  price high  imagine small target market  allegedly 400k vives wild  percentage think buying  m guessing randomly 10   s 40k units think s high end  price need high justify manufacture thing 
good headphones cost far 
headphones  enthusiast hardware  gon na cost bit
would nt want use headphones came  40 audio strap 
re joking right  htc re talking   
ouch  think  200 limit  maaaaaybe  250  anything m 
sure nt talking tpcast  250  nt seen anywhere number audio strap yet 
stuff like nt helpful without sourcelink 
 deleted 
m guesstimating strap  200  tpcast  250300  dream  200   
new headstrap part vive hmd  headphones optional  accounts  headstrap comfort vive falls  way  behind competition  get new headstrap available launch  compliments htc addressing vive s biggest shortcoming  need include new vive hmds going forward  selling  comfort  option 
understand nt ready lunch  im saying audio strap package right htc wants sell accessory 
headphones audio strap removable
already said new strap accessory  even name  deluxe  says htc thinks  btw call something  deluxe  2017 retarded 
oh yeah  nt get wrong  tpcast going amazing  nt hate wires enough pay  250  m sure must buy anyone cash 
even seated wire super annoying 
could game changer  expecting lot wonder woman simulators  spin around several times really quickly become  wonder womaaan  
nt know quite game changer everyone thinks  people forget cord anyways adding limit play time charging  adding cord headset belt  adding another step already somewhat cumbersome setup  adding weight already heavy headset  adding small amount artifacts  fairly hefty price get something makes small difference  personally m far excited new headstrap  s game changer 
agree still frightened emitter thingy ceiling would fry brain  
perhaps ones stay silent competent ones since nt actually know dates instead lying telling truth knowing 
find hard believe would released later  especially strap  s strap  complex piece machinery electronics  yes  meant read voice admiral ackbar 
reviews ve read great  complaint battery life  nt really think s deal breaker  someone complained s actually wireless battery   s ridiculous complaint 
 deleted 
yeah  last day feb 7th believe  nt enough game ready order apply  thanks suggesting though 
wo nt compare well 60ghz version  since 245ghz band require compression tpcast close raw 
want bring prices wont 
biggest gripe vive ergonomics  want strap even want wireless  willing price gouged thing nt cost much make  nt fool  re spending much manufacturing costs integrated headphones   upper limit  100  nt see money  s fucking head strap  people  high grade piece consumer technology 
take fix original design  200 would shitty move htc  would surprised  case separate product without headphones  comfort care user wellbeing 
sadly  
14999 less 
nt think early adopters current vive users average joes  price right percentage willing invest update could much greater  150 might well 10  less  thing htc think long term investment  minor upgares cost 150200  current five users suffer well vr whole look like cash grab industry  yeah  headphones get pretty expensive  really  part needed upgraded strap  remember rift ballpark prices following reaction  strap  could cost half much  nt send accessible vibes 
s true  okay headphones cost  10 audio strap phones comfortable sounded good sennheiser hd 558s  would definitely willing pay  nt think anyone impression anywhere near level 
says re good 
m saying think inexpensive  nt see need expensive 
still source would posted  remember seeing somewhere  could something someone said random site 
htc definitely sees re typing without sending 
 chat support one motor company see user typing
m thinking  150 headstrap  250 tpcast   200 headstrap little insane  really  100   150 gouging expected 
personally issues comfort  sure rift rigid headstrap comfortable vive means  un  comfortable  least nt last year  d much rather solid vr game devs start chugging away games last year vs waiting til year get started oculus monopoly vr 
think pissed people would included additional hardware price  d trying return vive buy new one  rational  s people work 
like twitch chat   deluxe 2017 lul 
guess nt play games constantly turn  play one hour vivecraft cord tangled 
swordmaster vr game makes tpcast instabuy  much movement spinning high difficulties  pause untangle wound 31 cord every five minutes   expert 9 
even  rolling chair
cheers
cheers
m also interested new strap  help make cumbersome setup slightly easier  well better weight distribution somewhat mitigate increased weight extra stuff head 
hour half cordless play  nah  ll get deluxe head band though  notice foam stuff hmd  hope s velcro 
re concerned heat s fair  re concerned electromagnetic radiation something worries  concern time battery splosions  hope use quality batteries chargers  knockoffhoverboard fiascos made little gunshy battery stuck back head  pocketfannypack 5 hour version available  m still gon na get one   
cheers
personally worried display unit ve showing beefier unit could never sold  250  units users buying might work well  tinfoil hat  know  m cautious random chinese company ca nt nowhere  ca nt wait user reviews 
reviews touch great  small hiccups people would deal breakers wireless video  m afraid get hopes high 
1080s found  550 quite regularly point  sub  800 1080 ti plausible  especially vega  500  doubt one  
yeah  going pay unreasonable amount  would rather save whatever steamvr hmd s might works 
going say actual face cushion headset cost 29€  25  made really cheap foam cost much  would nt hold breath strap  100  one thing would really like know  comes new cable buy one order use strap correctly 
d buy strap use audio piece  probably pass 
 ve tried 
interesting find  figure 
hope s simultaneous retailer rollout nt need order htc ridiculous shipping charges  hoping amazon newegg time htcs store 
 vs    waiting til year   get started oculus monopoly vr  s saying  ಠಠ making new bundle new headstrap   cheaper lighthouse  obvious move htc surely 
accessory sales  bundle  s sensible way  imo 
holopoint
onward  standing crouch find re cable head gets yanked back rage inducing 
hate get far pc  yank 1 cables connector box  game 
puppy creature makes tpcast instabuy  huge fan biting vive cable 
yeah s much cord getting day  s cord getting tight due rotations
haptic vest awesome  run vive subpack  experience stunning 
helps distribution long nt look  unfortunately things nt always work way 
d imagine using lipo batteries instead lion chances explosion pretty minimal  battery pack luckily nt strapped head
version without headphones give early adopters free make piece shit elastic rubbish gave us  way m spending big money given ll want use headphones anyway already decent welding mask mod 
well  face cushion current accessories replacements  buy vive  already get everything currently sold accessory  sure  d like extra face cushions  nt necessary  audio strap  hand  accessory sold separately  m saying cheap probably wo nt  nt think s fair compare price replacement parts separate accessory  also probably wo nt come new cable  strap designed  old  new cable work  wo nt need new cable 
underestimate convenience intergrated audio 
s removable
good  far  40  good  environment try  noisy  directly compare  d give 0 chances hell drivers headstrap better average  100 audiophile headphones  already huge markup   even oculus headphones cost  45 replace  would make sense  charging like  100 strap would severely limit number potential buyers  plus  none 50 vr games particularly impressive audio  regardless whether m using included earbuds  supposed retail value  80  expensive  real  headphones  plus  people would nt care anyway  headphones come cell phone  good   think s possible could put headphones worth  40 charge  200 strap 
nt  someone  htc replied typing sent
ll explicitly different sku  either higher price reduced price launch bundle  otherwise people buying returning vives get one new strap 
wait sick spins day holopoint 
biggest gripe
cringe thinking feeling  hate 
m sure m picturing right try playing without shoes ar nt already  feel m cable time ever gotten cable caught crouch one knee ground feel cable 
time  tpcast must buy 
cheers
thought smaller version head larger positioned belt 
ah good hear battery type  still think smaller 2 hour battery designed go back head larger 5 hour one would reside pocket waistband similar  designed offheadset much better though 
battery stick head two hour version
really  rift  tried instantly took favor headset  s great s option people want  seems shame either pay audio nt want skip better strap 
s removable adds cost  s annoyance lack funds  feels like fluff piece fluff price 
 good  far  40  good  well   40 good   environment try  noisy  mildly noisy  htc s private room  pretty packed  ces   directly compare  vive packin earbuds oculus rift builtin ear headphones  without side side test  seem good rift   d give 0 chances hell drivers headstrap better average  100 audiophile headphones well  s sure   even oculus headphones cost  45 replace  re par  remember  nt include strap system   charging like  100 strap would severely limit number potential buyers nt know  personally agree  100 everyone grandma would buy  nt think pricing  150 would detract many vr enthusiasts  m sure ve done market research price reflect findings   plus  none 50 vr games particularly impressive audio  regardless whether m using included earbuds  supposed retail value  80  expensive  real  headphones  need try something fantastic sound design spatial audio design  fair  usually find good vr audio content industry demo s  good consumer apps good audio  hover junkers one   think s possible could put headphones worth  40 charge  200 strap  s htc  better believe re considering  m say headphones means bad  good  wait reviews find 
little cable runs battery pocket
re right 
thanks answers  good know headphones good quality 
 s 5 hour battery  2 hour attaches headstrap
 m say headphones means bad  good  wait reviews find   thanks answers  good know headphones good quality  read 
used 2 hr ces pocket  afaik  could wrong 
 well   40 good  responding 
seems re right  sure believe  original release said battery mounts head  tradeoff would want longer battery life  cord back  look articles first announced ll see saying  ces units using new headstrap  maybe could nt incorporate battery new headstrap  knows 
understanding want little weight head possible  even 2hr battery would relatively heavy  deluxe strap adds weight also counterbalances  wanted  could clip top strap  s really easy clip belt stick pocket  cool thing setup world oyster  really whatever want  ve following tpcast closely  always impression battery packs something stick kind pocket  personally would nt want battery head
valve acquired 3d audio developer impulsonic
""
m glad see audio forgotten  good positional audio makes huge difference vr  removes another layer disbelief sure  nt actually heard company  wonder demo download  edit   link website   http  impulsoniccom  people like convenience  like 
maybe help new vive game        
unheard valve  nt 
s great  3d audio always thing wish valve pushed looks like might coming around  phonon also pretty good results s good see joining together  m pretty sure vr demo somewhere m certain

yes    s often overlooked aspect 3d sound fool manner  like 3d haircut audio youtube  almost makes hairs stand end eerily convincing
artists figure best way use binaural recording s going groundbreaking music well  current examples use terrible imo  random bits pearl jam record  songs use show instead using kind subtlety  
m ready 3d audio revolution spurred vr 
maybe implemented source 2 
maybe speed development phonon walkthrough  use phonon 3d good spatial plugin unity offer propagation occlusion  looking implementing self  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vjhwoglz49zc
feeling little dense  someone explain difference 3d audio audio used games currently  thought already ability emulate dimensional audio  
hope speeds phonon walkthrough
aww yiss
man want see plans seemingly ever expanding vive ecosystem
sounds nice
actually great news  audio much immersion  ll never forget first time tried binaural haircut  thing lol 
tutorials record 3d audio 
someone please explain  wo nt everything handled game engine  integrated game experience 
great  3d audio vive poor could much better   try psvr listen  amazing positional audio  nothing better stereo sound 
thinking onward
pretty much  weird move 
think  first time valve  acquired  company move absorb either personnel patents ip 
s first time hear absorb software library developer  wonder employees software developers  people might well look around new job 
acquire often enough  biggest ips nt start internally  portal cs acquisitions  instance  valve acquired teams made  cs community mod portal originally student project called narbacular drop 
huh  first example uses bigscreen apartment 
god damnit  whoever designed loft big screen spent like  5 bucks piece shit kitchen  immersion killer 
mad found binaural audio even vr nt exist video games  creative   wonder companies product bad hated  beje  smagu matyt lietuvį šiam subreddit  ę

s plenty fantastic binaural recordings chesky  http  wwwcheskycomcontentbinauralseries
well  s already implemented cs  go source 1 
two ears  two microphones  spaced bit apart  big ball flesh bone separating  gun fired right  sound travel toward hit right ear first  ms later left ear  right ear direct sound  whereas left head way  muffle bit  sound also bounces around surfaces room  creating reflections  reflections also aid lot telling position sound 3d space  especially comes far away  proper reflections let hear size room standing even without looking  like stand bathroom closed eyes  basketball court  even  silent   microphone ears also exterior floppy flesh part cups behind mic  means easily direct hearing  however also means sounds coming behind need go floppy bits reach miceardrums  things work tandem correctly predict three dimension sound originating  games today gunshot playing right  audio channels get sound time  however right higher volume  assume coming right  way discern wether sound level   somewhat mimics smart filtering  nothing like binaural hrtf  hrtf stands head related transfer function  describes latency filtering happens ears body 
would plugin engines integrated valve s engine  ue4 physical material system changing footstep sound effect  particles hit  sparks metal  mud splash mud  etc    different friction ice  etc  d assume source unity  would likely hook tell much reflectancedeadening sound material 
s software library  s already integrated cs  go since around month two ago 
 software  audio implementation  hardware  varying quality  eg  run trials tatooine vive 
thinking l43dvr
 s valve game  s even good need  use game  indie small relevant game  ask almost gamer  nobody knows fuck onward  people need stop fappin game  valve nt hire guy  gee 
s prevent least one audio technology captured facebook google 
think tech pretty impressive  time saving  extremely accurate  integrated 3d physical acoustic modeling  wildly efficient cpu huge biggie  good move valve  
first non gaming company 
ever really patents ips 
 removed 
yeah  independent projects mods  s much easier say acquired personnel gave home valve rather bought company 
s environment buy unity store  remember seeing used another vr game  https  wwwassetstoreunity3dcomen   content38532
exactly thought  weird conspiracy going 
fair  openalsoft years provided open source binaural audio 
https  youtubeiudtlvagjja think one good  mobile audio right ca nt check
nice  nt know 
since acquired doubt impulsonics expertise used csgo  fact lot people turned feature immediately came 
sick s coming 
want hug  big guy 
must new  onward one biggest mp games vr right 
would nt expect non vr flat gamers know better vr titles  disagree  onward needs better positional audio  real valvevr title d awesome would surprised 
pls s
s damn good combination  nt heard particular company positional audio solution  m camp feel like positional audio currently utilized many titles  m sure s multiple reasons  hopefully valve s purchase backing make easier devs implement 
vr audio gaming 
consider buying counterstrike mod ip yes  also left 4 dead team s game turtle rock studios 
well build steam link  steam box  steam controller  vr right  nt think simply inhouse software company without acquiring key technologies 
using first examples came mind  plenty draw dig  also would needed purchase ips folks avoid copyright issues  really s valid business acquisition anything else 
im assuming buy smaller parts cheaper  thats crazy expensive
yeah   creative  destroyed beginning interest 3d audio  hopefully nonvr games implement spacial audio future
downright amazing  see  hear  real immersion sounds like  imagine display vive fit sound 
gave chills  still feeling weird 
lot people also screwed around sound settings wondered sounded bad new audio system 
cs community nt like anything new  think new audio huge improvement  finally tell sounds coming good precision 
s right  cs  go  ships   https  githubcomsteamdatabasegametrackingcsgosearch  utf8  e2  9c  93  qphonon  phonon 
later  much  much later 
let s wait valve announce announcement announcement 4 vr titles promised would announce year 
big enough 
suprised  s literally used valve game right  heard counter strike global offensive  last updates got audio company   would nt expect non vr flat gamers know better vr titles sure  thats point  convert  flat gamers  need make good 2d game make good vr title  like csgo  nobody going jump unknown indie game  even valve helped something  valve stuff inside company  indie developers 
m praising onward  nothing indicating would use technology 
know already unity unreal plugin among others 
understand mean   feels  different  corporate personal 
binaural audio part oculus sdk even used vive game  oculus licensed used free  right  s perception thing  vr talked lot  sure missed   
valve time
""
say  
csgo vr confirmed  sorry nt touched csgo since vr  seems like good audio tech  valve trying build vr games right vr ecosystem  s d surprised  hopefully eventually 
 indie small relevant game  probably biggest mp game right  valve nt hire guy  gee  technically  hes valve studios  ask almost gamer  nobody knows fuck onward ask almost anyone plays vr  know onward
onward would hugely benefit high performance spatial audio 
 binaural audio part oculus sdk hrtf  aureal raytraced top  like nvidia highend gpus  vrworks audio   90s 
talkin times vr  course following anything vr binaural related long time
 probably biggest mp game right kind people  game many flaws  slow development   technically  hes valve studios many devs  also vr    ask almost anyone plays vr  know onward  vr evolves  go nothingness  point  valve many  much popular powerful ip s  like  uh  one game popular shooter since early 2000 s  damn  oh  counter strike  yeah  thats game  everybody knows  make vr version  market  nobody knows onward  everybody knows counter strike  valve knows make vr game  nt need one dropout help make counter strike  entire team  half entire valve vr right  l4d  slap game vr  gon na sell  names matter  onward means nothing gaming world  200 people playing small indie level real big world games  realistically nobody knows  reddit sure  s small community  people post religiously  still small part vr community  people nt care 
like every game 
raytraced audio  thought  box reverb filter  pretty awesome generate realistic reverb room  think s analytic    static reverb filter  
good good  
 many flaws  slow development  gee  s almost like one guy made  
 kind people   im pretty sure literally biggest mp game  always tons full servers  course slower development  one man team   many devs  also vr   source  dante one first people heard valve publicly took wing   real big world games isnt vr  vr currently defined indie titles   still small part vr community id say reddit huge population vr community  id pretty much bet  70  viverift owners also use reddit

true  games use audio game mechanic 
joachim holmér neat corporation invited valve hq last year work vr game  also dont think  70  vive owners use reddit 
  im pretty sure literally biggest mp game  always tons full servers  course slower development  one man team  biggest mean much  many people play game  got lucky first genre shooter like  right better fun games   source  dante one first people heard valve publicly took wing  s well known valve take developers office cooperate  budget cut devs invited almost 8 months ago  many others invited time  people jizzed themselfs onward dev also going  like something special  thats  news    isnt vr  vr currently defined indie titles  think still nt get point  onward marketing power  sold well counter strike vr  cs name power  onward  valve big developer cares money  ergo  onward means nothing  like said  sometimes take devs cooperate little  take entire game   id say reddit huge population vr community  id pretty much bet  70  viverift owners also use reddit  really actual data  s obvious  reddit overestimates s meaning scale entire world  many examples many subreddits  also bet  maybe 10  people vive maybe went subreddit vive  active users  add china equation  number go fast

99  games would benefit great sound  1  games deaf people 
 think still nt get point  onward marketing power  think cs huge marketing power came   also bet  maybe 10  people vive maybe went subreddit vive  data except personal experiences  people meet game visit subreddit often  even dont commentpost lot  didnt factor china 70   counting  would definitely lower percentage   right better fun games  subjective  realistic shooters  really isnt anything better onward right  popular
 onward means nothing got ta say  get facts making statements like  want actual data  http  vrlfgnet http  steamchartscomapp496240
define intellectual property  visually  want stories  s highly immersive team based milsim social components 
 think cs huge marketing power came  csgo  yes  cs mod  pretty popular   subjective  realistic shooters  really isnt anything better onward right  popular  totally realistic one live  sure  similar shooter  couple  like bam vr 
think still dont get point  onward compared cs nothing  onward vr right fad  game got lucky  many flaws nowhere perfect 
s bland nothing special would make stand 1000 military games 
bam vr nowhere near good  sounds suck  animations suck  graphics terrible  game whole feels lot worse 
cs isnt vr  likely wont  cs would work vr  made  wouldnt anything like 2d version  onward flaws still hasnt relatively long time  one person working  valve helping  lot things fixed soon
 many flaws nowhere perfect  s almost like s early access game  made one person    m sure cs launched buggy 
 mah single dev thingy   cant judge game  one dev  seriously  graphics actually make game playable reasonable framerate  sound ok  animations bug  cares  game modes  nt wait spawn half round  game actually fun  maps fun 
 cs would work vr  made  wouldnt anything like 2d version  point make game like csgo  vr  course wo nt exactly like 2d version  would big game   valve helping  lot things fixed soon valve nt work like  s going like  rent engineers work together fix bugs game overall  lol  valve nt work like  might talk suggest things  fix game 
play onward fine gtx 1060 reprojection  practiced got better onward  maybe wouldnt wait spawn half time either  obviously different taste dont think onward fun  bam s maps plain boring  onwards arent much better  structures add quite bit 
 point make game like csgo  vr  course wo nt exactly like 2d version  would big game  wouldnt call cs  cs twitch shooter vr wont anything like  motions real  nobody real life flicks sniper 90 degrees lands shot  recoil control wont good normal controllers since would feel weird  way would get anything like gun props   might talk suggest things  fix game  whole point give support  definitely people help needs 
good  nt work well   practiced got better onward  maybe wouldnt wait spawn half time either  s design game  bad makes frustrating   obviously different taste dont think onward fun  like idea  dislike execution   bam s maps plain boring  maps bam plain simple  least  bigger smaller complicated one s  simple maps fun maps  boring   onwards arent much better  structures add quite bit  onwards maps ass  campy  make design game even worse 
 wouldnt call cs  cs twitch shooter vr wont anything like  motions real  nobody real life flicks sniper 90 degrees lands shot  recoil control wont good normal controllers since would feel weird  way would get anything like gun props   point build fundations csgo  fast rounds  small maps  simple objective  buy guns start round  guns recoil  5vs5 etc  rest vr implementation  really nt know got wrong   whole point give support  definitely people help needs  many vr devs went valve last months work like  valve charity fixes bugs 
think expecting something different onward  tactical  slow paced game super concentrated make sure check everything  bam faster paced dm like  onward definitely better game eyes though
  point build fundations csgo  fast rounds  small maps  simple objective  buy guns start round  guns recoil  5vs5 etc  rest vr implementation  really nt know got wrong  want recoil work controllers  bring downwards specific pattern recoil  sounds terrible  cant build foundations csgo really wouldnt use many mechanics define game  sure  could short rounds small maps  would mean rotations wouldnt matter much map control wouldnt big part game  vr implementation would big changes current cs  making almost unrecognizable 
like slow military shooter  sure  thats subjective talk right 
 bring downwards specific pattern recoil  sounds terrible  guess never used gun real life   cant build foundations csgo really wouldnt use many mechanics define game  yes would  like said last post   vr implementation would big changes current cs  making almost unrecognizable  really  like said  fundation would  would work vr 
 guess never used gun real life  real gun weight figure  holding two controllers doesnt much weight  figure  meaning would awkward actually pull recoil   yes would  like said last post  ones exactly  wouldnt able flick well every gun battle would slow paced  wouldnt shoulder peaking jumping would reworked since hitting button jump makes feel sick 
 hitting button jump makes feel sick  like trackpad motion  nothing ever made sick vr  jumping  would work fine  like trackpad motion  supposed hell vr  somehow people play   wouldnt shoulder peaking yeah  actual peaking  way immersive   meaning would awkward actually pull recoil  dunno works games  shoot constantly  pulls  would op recoil  nobody ever complained  works

still psvr 10 days sort fence  skyrim cool vr experience  dated graphics fact ve played soooo many times kind kills  hav nt played fo much s deal tempting 
contacted amazon see could throw sort bone  doubt  ll let know
also vive comes fallout 4 google brush  whatever s called   pretty good deal 
first nt need extra camera  certainly nt need two extra cameras  rifts vive development purposes vive inferior every way except tracking opinion  also get rift  399  100 free gift card right  rift paying  200 less better product free games available software  fanboys would choose vive point 
likely comes fallout 4 vr
rift currently  299  399  100 amazon gift card  totally roomscale without extra cameras  personally think third camera helps little people office use two development find fine  even unneeded extra camera still  150 cheaper  get many games like lone echo robo recall  reason vive bought first development reasons  playing rift significantly better experience days though 
s deal today  order amazon return decide keep odyssey
 comparing bb mc deals 
received gift card yet  ’ boat still ’ received mine 
amazon good returns right  ca nt buy one return one  assuming foot bill refund  
rift comes 89 games  including lone echo robo recall 
 first nt need extra camera  certainly nt need two extra cameras depend room size 
 also get rift  399  100 free gift card right  
d also need long usb cable two  maybe  usb card 
reason s cheaper thing owned facebook  d put comparison spreadsheet 
s 39900 listing gift card us amazon  another one 4something think one added camera

 rift currently  299  399  100 amazon gift card  link 
gotcha
yes got separate package day got vive 
games locked oculus ecosystem  worthless
yes point  based steam survey 90  peoples room sizes 3 3 meters 2 cameras work pretty well  3 cameras better jump 4 pretty much pointless 
people talking 2 days ago rift subreddit  online deal sure 
yeah budget motherboard need  20 usb card going 2 cameras  true  otherwise might get tracking issues 
checked us one s 45700 usd one 39900 usd  nt see either offering 100 usd gift card 
yes use revive try robo recall  s bad  enough buy rift still bad game 
 worthless  makes sense  people seem prefer getting vr games via oculus client

viveport marketing confirmed headphones removed ces livestream today 
like psvr  one thing loved headset  made fit feel nice secure  good job vive
sure  without headphones  strap would like  50  75  headphones s going  100  d rather pay much headphones wo nt use 
well  optimally course d rather immediately break something likely costs upward  100  nt see small bolt mount first though  comes wiring guess  hoping would simple detach  case decided use demoing  example 
nice headphones  specifically made shorter cable use vive  makes headphones completely nonissue pop 
looks interesting  definitely agree concerns people thread  question overall security  mounted high th skull  well keeps hmd pressed face  counter light bleed bouncing focus  something keep eye final product sure  3d printed prototype leaves lot open

d cool s plug oculus headphones  new jbl headphones look nice 
lack proper positional audio would drive insane 
nt get much enjoyment  300  500 headphones built rift ones  rift headphones already sound pretty damn good  someone visual aesthetics personally would rather convenience dealing extra device put head take every time want play  vive s headphones par rifts s good enough 
yeah hear ya  huge fan onear headphones  ve got old pair steelseries siberias  large  openback  circumaurual headphones 2ft cord really like vive  nt feel like onear headphones would isolate outside noise well d like vr immersion  d get new strap  100  headphones   150 likely much additional hardware nt want 
think logically though feel like cost less 199 lets say headphones 50  really see charging 150 strap  100  sure  ill put wishful thinking deluxe audio headstrap 14999
pay headphones get strap  d really like strap 
looks like cord meant go headset opposed use included audio cord  obviously combine two  probably wo nt fit exceptionally well 
pay  want strap 
ahhh shiiiiiiiiiiit  welp  nt know

ah true  forgotten 
re right  picture linked makes look smaller round 
m talking clip right side  coiled thin headphone cable left  someone else pointed  angles look like og cable fit clip well 
s way rift nt seen many complaints  make putting headset way easier  current strap always pull slack cable give head enough room fit  also make adjustments multiple users easier 
honestly dont know  vive since day one times wish cable wasnt going back head  mainly seated experiences though  rare 
sure  comments thread said otherwise  fugazification   said want make one sku two separate products requiring different molds 
except interface vive strap appear rigid weight still held tension  means pressure face even though back head cupped comfortably  m bit worried  look nice ca nt tell really better job 
alright cool  wallet bout alot lighter
strap looks great arcade use foam problem many users  s m asking  would nt problem 
yeah  want headstrap use headphones audio system  nt want pay remove 
 made fit feel nice secure  everyone ive seen talk psvr feels lot less secure  including friend tried vive  said psvr look basically feels like falling rapid movement lets light sides resettles onto face  new one vive looks like drastic improvement tho  knob back see still pulls hmd towards back head  something psvr doesnt 
took bit type response  time typing  bunch people seemed indicate s latch releases  makes sense  still  even nt case  pointing worst case scenario 
s option grados use  otherwise definitely would 
still flip option big deal people 
contact general support twice  first rep said  asked second rep said yes  day one vive headstrap frayed daily use  told send old headstrap get replacement

well  m inclined want new strap s 36 months  means preorders  doubt run quickly  start 14 months  spending  100 mod supplies  nt know ll ready take doubt even larger financial hit official one   100 contraption go pretty well complete waste   basically  cross fingers ll either  extremely satisfied modded helmet point nt feel need new one  b  happily ideal world financial wonder order new one without monetary concerns whatsoever  otherwise ll stuck c  m unhappy failed mod even unhappier timing buying mod mere days could saved money official release

""
could buy 
htc really include little card box vive shows route earbuds like  http  iimgurcomzqaqln2jpg never trouble finding ca nt mix left right ears like nt route 
still sure ears touching thing  http  iimgurcomnmlu1pqpng currently straps go slightly ears  time ears hurt   photos  ears touch something  s ears nt like  least mine   looks like  lower part new headstrap goes way  would enable side straps little bit higher 
get rush get market  htc nt invest much time d liked headstrap audio solution make cutbacks keep headset desirable affordable  comparison rift time   point onwards however  really need drop old strap start shipping vive  rift already solution slightly cheaper option  choose keep separate upgrade  s going put potential buyers  especially headsets hit market  best want certain point  people s wallets slam shut vive already passes people  want people joining us vr nt make worse htc 
 wheeeen     throws tantrum  
could nt take review reviewer seriously said using television audio source vive 
oo original headstrap nt supposed pulled way   rotate counter clockwise clicks gently pull away  also  pick side strap     lol
nope  ve used audiotechnica m50s every time  earbuds  certainly immersionbreaking pc speakers 
lol fuck would carry vive connection point  course s gon na snap point  always carry top strap
m probably going modding get deluxe audio strap  thinking modifying weight gets distributed forehead  kind like current welding mask mod  http  imgurcomuhluh3f
given early adopters least discount  also  take whole year ship  htc slow  wait competitors show  sony fb creating exclusivity dividing markets bad everyone  remains seen microsoftdellacer handle entries  choice better 
reviews available buy online 
give guide breaking headstrap connecter  lol
point m waiting psvrlike headstrap supposed released month  different steamvr hmd altogether  opinion  better audio solution  easier procedure slightly better comfort  all said s even less comfortable original strap  worth 100   40  shipping  htc release two versions  one without audio  40   one audio 
piggybacking obliquely related comment  plan getting mine amazon  guys think odds product go live amazon time everywhere else  knowing htc  re probably going manufacture 5 straps start 
http  wwwmicrocentercomproduct480189vivedeluxeaudiostrap
amazing  got mine last week  best thing look without getting blurry image  perfect onward minigolf etc  makes easy put headset peoples head
got newer vive  maybe nt thing release  earbuds came mine little plastic block right earbud s wire  nothing left  tell apart feel

 re supporting multiple 3rd parties bringing wireless solutions vive market well ahead competition    would nice das earlier balance ve front runner delivering hardware need legitimate competitors  imagine lg set already  ecosystem would grow much faster 
think amazon starts selling us monday 
yeah  shipping cost ludicrous  m europe think ms store option may get htc  m sztill getting 100 feels ok shipping real stinger 
 nt found particularly comfortable  still front heavy  s less comfortable strap  thinbony face  might factor 
s one  s cheaper  s comfort  m paying 100  strap still pushes weight hmd face top head  ll wait reviews  revolve prove comfortable enough  ll get

price needs drop s hope ecosystem growing much 
htc already compete oculus openly subsidizing price supposedly making profit hardware huge losses software look amount invested 
amazon  able find somewhere less

nt even realize built mic  always use ear headphones mic 
wish lol  doubt  htc nickel dime us  £130 one controller  delivery  lol  hope lg s stuff releases  maybe htc decide make pricing reasonable 
rip little jimmy bought 1 day late 
oh snap  serious first comment  apologies  thought trying funny  ll moving along

three products market none great weaknesses new competitor exploit  meaningful improvement screen resolution s one company planet capable making screens required  ergonomic improvements possible people going buy complete new vr kit scratch improved head mounting system  vive worst ergonomics already firstparty strap replacement available matter days thirdparty strap replacement horizon  s new competitor going offer

cant say m impressed looking photosit looks poorly put together different original rough concept model  thought final version would come polished properly manufactured looking  whilst highly tempted saw original kickstarter  given bad  good  timing price  m really glad went das instead  ve actually really happy das wife dislikes   95 vs £100 das  really much competition people 
looks bloody awful  sure nt send prototype  actually consumer version   s consumer kit raised  50000 create  s embarrassing 
holy hell look cheaply made
guys actually delivered  mean looks terrible  delivered working product  way going make production tooling ks funding thought doomed  pulled  good stuff 
wow  super tacky looking  strongly considered getting revolve ended getting deluxe audio strap  getting worried hearing noise padding deteriorating reckon ve dodged bullet 
m sorry appalling final unit  good version 3d print would slightly iffy thing send final opinion given moolah raised  print awful  re going 3d print something use  really need using different method imo  would trust expensive item like vive fdm print long term  wonder getting couple professionally printed sls form perhaps dimensionally accurate nicely finished ones molded silicone small runs cast prop maker style would feasible  nt loads backers  doubt would lot work would produce far nicer item 
 way deluxe audio strap announced could nt read past sorry  24 hours das announced  worst timing ever human history  uspartauzqc posted heading  revolve  kickstarter soon   would link make everyone s life easier  apparently linking within reddit fraught danger granted rights wield power rvive  jan 4  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v5kiwnmhzsm jan 4  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vbs2s2sfp1r0  available das available couple weeks  didnt even beat release 
super disappointing  surprising  given aggressive timetable  nt seem likely could improve design much still time print headsets shipping  since 3d printing takes incredibly long time  d managed use injection molding could different story  knew shortly kickstarter nt happening  d kickstarted purely 3d printed prototype  made designs available people iterate done  d backed  looks like really good starting point design  finished product  seems like leaves lot desired  frustrating  someone huge usually shaped head  kind neanderthal protruding brow  throws balance focus mask   stock headstrap tremendously uncomfortable  d really love psvrstyle mount  might go lg headset comes 
made feel like oversized head since still makes contact fully open  makes feel like gave much travel small side closes way smaller needs  making thin sliders longer needed  causing little flimsy  thick foam seems thick  m sure must tested things came best solution could even nt feel quite right 
looks terrible  d assumed finished consumer version would ended injection molded least  shipping 3d printed parts 
looks prototype rough  price nearly das  pass 
thanks review  think well developers 360 video editors  ability flip headset quickly minimizes barrier working pc previewing vr  gamer d consider lower price  d find useful seated experiences like elite dangerous virtual desktop  would make things like eating  drinking  keyboardmouse use easier 
fwiw  large head  large head go hat store get biggest one still gives headache typically get biggest helmet  people never believe  even people stores  guess m fairly proportioned   insist smaller size realize wrong  said find das  much comfortable easy put regular strap  s kickerit even fits 3 year old s head perfectly without modifications  eg  stuffed animal behind head like old strap   s pretty wide range 
play something like thrill fight let know go lol  one way doubt get anytime soon even though early backer  dont think im even going bother installing wobbles much playing things like thrill fightaudio shield etc
man  disconcerting  mine  int  l  nt arrived  delays updates regarding quality assurance  hopeful final build would least feel solid  flipup feature main reason canceling kickstarter backing  reading posts  m imagining regularly swap revolve stock strap  nt sound fun description   thanks indepth post 
anyone thinking getting  strongly suggest coating parts assembly  naked 3d prints pourus  soak sweat like sponge become rancid weeks bacteria starts grow inside 
explains nt single clear picture thing website 
would nt say competes das  sorry op 
nt realise final finished product would still look like diy project someone made home  professional looking  shame concept really good idea 
forgot important feature  donning headstrap get 3 creeper smile 
flip mechanism rear foam swivel clever innovative  major flaw imho due fact first vive preorder used pick vive top strap 6 month needed new 3in1 cable due stress caused cables going hmd  flipping regularly cause lot stress cable s kind effect trying snap piece wire bending back forth eventually brake  ordered deluxe audio strap htc tuesday last week received following day quite surprised  uk   happy see problem goes away new das cables nt run top route around side totally remove problem  ve used new strap hours m happy audio quality comfort makes big difference 
awful print quality  use  cheap 120  china printer 
also backed  afaik mine nt shipped yet  disappointed review  cest la vie  thanks 
holy fuck  could nt even afford injection moulding 
even print decent quality  nt  s horrendous  postprocessed well  fdm printed parts never used production  especially parts printed pla  fdm 3d printing great rapid prototyping  even properly postprocessed parts high end printer like ultimaker nt standards strength surface finish people come expect age injection moulded plastic  goes doubly parts contact body  unfinished pla likely absolutely rank within weeks use  fdm prints porous  great insulators heat  thing going get hot  soak moisture face like sponge  provide sorts nasties warm  damp environment flourish  saddest part injection moulders often work help optimize design injection moulding  guys nt simply amend design make possible injection mould puzzler 
great concept accessory vive  s cheap build  hopefully serious  better conceived quality crafted version comes  critics  1 nt like cable go head kind defeats purpose headband  d wish preinstalled rack cable either one side  2 headplate really big  overall build body foam incredibly cheap especially price  3 design manner support headset weight head tighten back pads  rather actually design sit whole head crown like psvr  room around head leaves lot wobbling room  otherwise s intended s cheap prototype use  however idea great  d wish psvr like headband viveoculus  especially additional liftingup mechanism one principal reason ordered  s great vr headsets 
point comparison  das actually fits four year old daughter s small head pretty impressive  could nt stock strap  question  stable distance hmd face  example could wear padding light leakage issue gasket like psvr s blocks light holds weight  appealing thing use  even say virtual desktop  next face contact 
 deleted 
s passes finished product  yikes  anybody could see failure product  dead water htc announced dal day two kickstarter steaming pile crap 
thanks write  overear headphones try wearing 
rename htc vice
absolutely hate forehead pressure designed hmds  become much uncomfortable  much quicker either headset 
since takes tens thousands dollars make mold plastic injection molding nt see could sent anything hand made 3d printed units  problem kickstarter guys getting pr savvy make everything look exciting fantastic make sound like re perfectly capable delivering claim  problem amateur  lone wolf  scam artist get onto kickstarter sucker  less critical  people  m saying scam clearly delivered sort money asking even 50k got s way could come something quality get produced professional firm costing  200  400k make  mass produced 
news  anyone looking sell revolve hmu  still want flipup ability 
honestly  wish could get money back  already crack right side near teeth due layers put 3d printer  puts great amount stress strap sides well  nt line well instructional video install  side wobble noticeable nt get close enough face  dislike gap 
3d fdm printing  prototype fdm printing   finished product general sale 
ve read das nt significantly reduce face pressure  s care 
even das nt exist pretty weak  95 product
also kind expected change would looks going  prototype   http  imgurcomya901fr   seen back february  consumer version gets shipped  also  one behind kickstarter implied final unit looking quite better prototype    https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments5tuk89tribalinstinctsbriefreviewofthe3dprintedddpsxuo   linking various hideous prototypes got nice looking product end  edit  even promised wobble thing seen  alpha prototype  finished product post 
sent early prototype reviews months ago ve upgrading prototypes ever since  assume production version shipping backers  ll see s new unit  production vive  pre  m wondering print nt fit 
agree  rarely see kickstarters m actually interested come fruition props guys seeing shipping something  even nt perfect  hope consider another round proper manufacturing vivers see good bet support  would 
 way going make production tooling ks funding funny vrge fine less backer money  look updates kickstarter  clear experience product production seems making massive difference 
 deterioration  residue left manufacturing process  nothing actually fell effect lasted long took residue fall 
ouch  yes  wondering revolve even bothering given release das  way would able compete given modest kickstarter 
let s real  though  das nt need exist product serious problems 
agree  maybe limited small print bed  nt know 
injection molds incredibly expensive build  complex ones cost much even machine used  head strap would require several molds since made couple components  tooling costs would kill gets even production  engineering production costs nt even included yet  one simply indiegogo injection molded parts without already connections industry access production line  hethey collected  48627on kickstarter  thats barely enough called family tool  including larger couple smaller parts tool  depending capability injection molding machine  including molds ejector mechanism  heated polymer distribution system material costs  huge massive slab expensive tool steel   still need 2 3 tools  better chinese cousin owns injection molding business poisonous knock goods 
completely agree points 
nt tried games  threw beachballs around air steamvr  difficult aim head correctly due wobble 
apparently making updated unit  receive corrected edition  would nt difficult swap headstraps revolve easy attach  presumably 
s item category  therefore competes  das winning moment though 
fair always said would 3d printed 
true  strong potential unit  maybe fixed time 
 least using robo 3d r1 printers make units  see reddit post r3dprinting  https  wwwredditcomr3dprintingcomments6h7lagmyprintshavebeencursedwithzitsihavetrieddiw336t
doubtful  get nice 3d printer 40k
injection molding extremely expensive difficult smaller company  according kickstarter update  chosen manufacturer unable mold revolve unit designed required redesign unacceptable  understand decison  would hoped would printed extremely slowly carefully compensate 
100  correct  sweat 3d prints gnarly combination   cost  injection molds parts would easily cost  100k
removed front foam  tighten ratchet vice revolve tightly pressed face  minimal light leakage  tend comfortable less padding  s  distance screen fairly stable 
 would better sold license get printed  access printers services backers would already case  das nt thing already  would happily paid model license  would sent friend print mail pieces back  m decent 3d printing friend better  m confident could printed layers practically invisible 
hey hey think s bit unfair  encourage competition strong potential thirdparty headstrap unique design feature  revolve provides  m disappointed current build  design objectives good 
try overear headphones  sorry  revolve s rachet mechanism sticks side head  would likely contact overtheear headphones  tried  suspect would difficult wear something like m50x unit 
yeah  either intention ever injection moulded re incredibly naive  work company makes lot plastic resin components figures get thrown around make head spin 
nt received mine yet  would interested selling 
want mine 
hairline crack front  approximately 1cm front teeth  talking different crack  feel disappointed probably would nt bought known current state delayed timeline  s nature kickstarters least sending updates 
 wife  think head size  shape plays lot  ve got huge noggin  wife  much

think nt know really expensive  otherwise would nt said following shortly kickstarter campaign ended    https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments5paju5therevolveheadgearkickstarterisfunded400dcq3yrf    hey oddzball  great question  capability  somewhat  mass 3d printing locally  reached initial goal  5000 would approach would taken would able release comfortable vr headstraps  would ridges plastic due 3d printing    said  fair exceeded initial goal looking like able get injection molds made first run revolve    let know answered question  cheers  john  however  realize nt possible later kickstarter update told kickstarters re going 3d printed run  https  wwwkickstartercomprojects1552002329revolveforviveposts1852863
damn nt bode well  guess ll keep im developing heavily need lift feature  thats main reason purchased anyway  shame bit pain install looks dont want taking onoff time lol 
well  s certainly nice hear  reason kickstarter comments nt showing mobile  although presentation is important  nt mind looked long promised functionality  aspect described subpar final version  heart kinda sank  least re continuing communicate backers trying hold end deal  m glad that part first kickstarter went well  least 
0  market share   sounds like reading thread   s competition 
said due exceeding kickstarter goal  re looking injection molds  also said possibility kickstarter campaign   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments5paju5therevolveheadgearkickstarterisfunded400dcq3yrf later ve realized actually ca nt feasible way going 3d print  https  wwwkickstartercomprojects1552002329revolveforviveposts1852863
nt excuse poor craftsmanship
course expensivewhy would kickstarter re selling 3d prints  mean  sure engineering costs damn 
yeah never read much kickstarter raised   100 original promise injection moulded product would nt take anything less properly postprocessed nylon sls print  d said beginning final product primarily going use 3d printed parts  maybe vapor smoothed abs printed actual decent printer would acceptable  always print abs multiple parts weld acetone  allows print larger components faster vapor smooth  printing intricate features higher resolution leaving unsmoothed 
ya meant face gasket  assume forehead foam necessary  ok  sounds pretty good  add say  could ideal development even headset handy see desk  thanks 
s name company much would cost injection mold something like  m electronics engineer running electronics design firm boxes plastics something ve stay away large costs involved 
yeah hmu  m slightly discounted revolve 
sure  pm 
yea right teeth
yes  s still competitor 0   wow  people thread fucking assholes  jeez  s professional product  marketed way  intended improvement small number people  das even announced 
5000  kickstarter goal doesnt get even close injection molded process  even 40 000  made would get one mold one larger components  heck  construct build less complex injection molds car industry  like  turn signal housings mold costs 20 000  30 000  realize
easy say  wo nt even make fraction money selling  get money back initially spent getting injection molding process production line running  niche item like cant produced mass production method costs arm leg realize  tell  company went crunched numbers  realized even selling one head strap half vive users would make financially feasible  even justifiable use mass production method like injection molding  also  injection mold company might looked parts constructed additive manufacturing methods said   nah  cant even get parts mold  would build super complex molds open like transformer get things  could maybe mold pins reliably  go  expensive  industrial designer person  get properly constructed parts able injection molded  come back  
yep  also see two reports kickstarter comments  guess systemic 
marketing selling consumer product  still taking preorders  http  wwwsynergywizcomrevolve seem like intend used small number people 
 das even announced announced day  stop trying rewrite history 
yeah  wtf plan  5k goal bs begin 
yeah  s another consideration  reasonably complex bit kit moving parts  chunk plastic  company work wellknown manufacturer tiny plastic goblins tool moulds inhouse  even  even though re literally pieces plastic  costs involved would utterly crush someone budget kickstarter pulled  sadly economy scale likely means want something like vive  ll make 
hate blame  poor version management   sounds like nt shit together  thus nature kickstarter
yeah  small number people would buy would consumers  s big  expensive  relatively unknown kickstarter  yeah  really doubt made goal every vr user one
big revolve cabal forcing rewrite history  brave stand real crimes humanity   conceptualized  prototyped set kickstarter day  obviously developing least weeks months kickstarter  das announced

really excited strap  looks supremely built  need price  250 bucks way much severely kill sales  s chance production costs even remotely close high  htc  trust  sell deluxe audio headstrap 9999 usd less sell like hotcakes  anything higher  even pricing 100 usd vs 9999 usd negatively impact sales  one definitely buying s priced around 100 bucks 
m interested feel pressure  hook lot better round back head

encouraging news  ca nt wait get one  assuming pricing reasonable    currently vive modded similar fashion using welding mask harness sennheiser headphones attached  definitely willing pay official version  also hope new vives ship new strap  least option choose marginally increased price  get handmotion controller similar touch  would homerun  edit  saw tracker attached glove controller  would work even better touch  since vive controllers separate object hand controller  could pickup original vive controller use gun  independent hand controls  amazing

s cross putting rift putting psvr  put like rift tighten adjust like psvr 
could nt today  refer comment details 
day special access  re  looser later day 
seconded another ces attendee  would absolutely love try new hardware possible 
 foam headstrap removable  part  possibly removable thing saw earpieces foam   hold headset hands  behave one piece object like rift  yes  small limp middle right next wear attaches   s 3 1 cable attached side headset instead head like current version  idea  cable minder experience 
friends invrse studios tried get demo tpcast  stopped demos shortly got reason  s got stress test deluxe audio strap  ryan smith invrse said amazing experience  minor complaints  could nt tell  maybe uinvrse share 
s render current strap  band back band 3in1 snakes plastic looking render
feeling remove headphones device use prefer 
raises hand big head  like straps vive  since nt share headset  set forget  fits noggin well places weight back huge head 
7 34 hatband  even extended way  rift headband pinchy uncomfortable  add wear glasses  makes rift fitment even difficult finicky  demo d one touch best buy buddy cv1  equally annoying uncomfortable  vive fits   much   better comfortably  especially straps adjusted correctly  easypeasy hold hmd like binoculars  lean head back  tighten side straps  nt tried new headband yet  s improvement even existing one sidestraps nt sit ears  well  win around 
 increased comfort worth giving surround sound headphones imo  surround sound vr better achieved stereo headphones  two ears  reason put two audio sources 
right  costs much good pair wireless headphones better hve fucking good headphones haha
s head strap headphones  anything 50   would expensive
samesimilar boat  ve contemplating rigid head mount mod  ie  take welding mask head frame  build adapters fit vive  go  considering solution costs  20 similar level comfort  thing ca nt  150 kindly go fuck cactus  nt care good headphones  already earbuds work great 
 really really want one mine usually shifts litte bit time time adjust  let known pay  100  strap couple headphones  prefer using mine anyways  htc rep reading  right thing  nt make cost like  250 
 much want  m going exploited something low build cost addressing deficiencies never existed first place 
saves 230 usd solves 80 percent problem cure enough  xd
sure well wireless plays  also  nt builtin headphones 
cans built non optional imagine looking least 150 vive learned pleasantly surprised pricing  learned anticipate cringing going nope 
thanks honest responses  bad signs yet least  
s beanie  like toque  knit hat  m confused 
around face  use match thinner facial gasket 
official undoubtedly superior  worth last half year worth comfort    http  iimgurcomefnvp0vjpg
peiple thought vive rift would 300500 usd tops 2015 mean  s lenses  oled panels plastic right
alsoran prefer vive comfort wise mostly due wearing glasses 
really 
people keep tossing around  250 way way much  think  100 fair  really hope nt try gouge 
ok  thanks 
awesome  thanks   ll keep eyes peeled release 
well cut noise loud people 
source  ve looking found nothing  pictures show wiring far ear going strap decidedly nonremovable fashion 
darn  would ve loved hear impressions someone glasses  side note  read user namer vrninja first  read comment nodded thinking   ninja  indeed   thanks letting know  though   
sincere apologies offended way  meant tongueincheek  clearly failed  english first language   sorry made sound like suggesting truthful  believe  also  thanks video  ca nt wait deluxe headstrap  game 
putting rift unique  aware diference 
thanks answering talking foam padding back headstrap  s likely s removable
oh  knew  talking price  nt want pay audio get good vr comfort 
headsets 
common misconception
htc referred  deluxe headstrap   s definitely gon na 50   maybe even 100  
s way wo nt  50  new 3in1 cable alone costs  40 
always find funny someone compares cost hack actual product  s reason almost technology kickstarters fail 
 considering solution costs  20 similar level comfort tf told  ve tried every head mount mod sun multiple times comfortable ergonomic 
priorities  rush market oculus rushing market  least assured gen 2 vive better ergonomics 
said working tp cast solution  http  wwwroadtovrcomyestpcastswirelessvrsolutionworkvivesnewdeluxeheadstrap
https  wwwgooglecomsearch  qpicturesofbeanies
 toque spotted canadian 
irrelevant product would think  whatever lenses facial interface want 
kk  ll allow wrong 
confirm  rift vive prefer later face
hope s  100   100  literally every vive owner know would buy  every little bit  ll lose potential customers 
course fair release low cost version without audio built
knowing htc  ll  200   250 add shipping lmao  know accessory store like 
really depends audio solution  mean  good headphones  acceptable ones  costs range  150 
well  could hear people actively trying talk 
 video   https  youtube8owozrhqo4c  t13s  shows someone gamespot putting vive new headstrap wearing glasses well  looks easy fit even us nonoptimal vision  
m thinking regular strap better glasses  putting front back makes fit easy  tried welding mask mod went back elastic 5 minutes 
worries  nt  smarmy  game chinese nt english name yet  nt know say type 
 putting rift unique  put rift like baseball cap  back front  put standard vive like pair binoculars  pull strap back 
much doubt  felt builtin  could probably tear though 
companies generally avoid offering multiple versions product complicates everything ends making products expensive simply produces one version  example price headphones model  150 non headphones model  100  however  developed single version product headphones could price  100  feeling cheaper everybody create single product case 
ve tried rift  nt buy  like headset  vive fit head better 
yes  common misconception  went vr audio talk head spatial audio microsoft hololens definitely disagree  addition realspace 3d audio big names field 
 ll 50  100 shipping smh
sale vs everyone s sale  never argued people would nt buy  argued   would nt 
get  although feel like ergonomics could improvement vive dk headset   m saying nt want exploited pricing  make reasonable  especially since earlyadopters best form advertising vr  people going interested buying vr re demoing head strap s nice comfortable  feel like nt go crazy pricing  wo nt upgrade  upgrade  helps htc 
s headstrap re talking 
aye  thanks  supposed could ve googled brain already quit day

yeah overhead high short run like 
thought 
get virtual surround sound stereo headphones  need external sound card extra software  surround sound headsets sound card software built right  personally prefer  either way  waaay topic point trying make  zero excuse vr companies force people pay headphones want get comfortable headstrap  could easily sold separately  enables charge things nt need would otherwise bought  takes away choice customer  bundling like common business practice  yes  nt mean accept  s get apple  good grossly overpriced products force people keep buying proprietary tech keep working together conveniently  consumers nt stand kind thing lose 
eh  build quality looks worth  50 start looking materialsoverhead vs production yield  hope nt go overboard margins  m interested audio quality frequency range  loaded would consider getting head strap https  wwwaudezecomproductssineseriesisinevrearheadphone
think s  150 ll fine sales  tpcase  250  s already  400  pretty big pill swallow accessories  knowing ll probably buy whatever gen 2 line 
unless got dragon ball z hairdue headset nt touch much get front 
re 100  right  long hair  s one many reasons prefer vive  said  putting rift one extra step  sweeping bangs back put

everything fine 
bigscreen automatically configures windows audio voicemeeter banana order stream desktop audio  specifically  set windows  default audio playback one voicemeeter virtual audio devices  s pretty much changes existing audio setup  nt interfere audio software  bigscreen also cleanly resets computer back previous settings stop desktop audio streaming 
1080p30 stream approx 1525mbps  480p30 like 300kbps something  note  s per person  full 4person room  ll stream 3 people  480p 900kbps  give take   assumes good skylake pc  re streaming 1080p like 12 fps  re working improving fps issues streaming   barely use 200kbps 
nt really bitrate issue  rather problems encoding fast enough framerate  encoded video low framerate  thus see low upload bandwidth utilization  re working improving encoder 
s  performance issue  windows 7 technology  ie  apis  use show desktop vr implemented microsoft windows 8 first time  technology  bigscreen built  literally does nt exist windows 7 could support windows 7  would  re silly reasons  windows 7 great os  wish could work  bigscreen simply crash  however  ll try find ways around future  ll require lot engineering effort create version run windows 7  maybe one day ll engineering resources time explore 
thing want program multi monitor 
specific order  general areas focus team next couple months 
make sure voicemeeter banana installed  normal voicemeeter  check  windows add remove programs  app try uninstall vm  make sure restart pc well  nt work issues  post steam email us  contact  bigscreenvr  ll help 
issue  kept using bigscreen
1  bigscreen completely free  always free use  making profit  team backed venture capitalists  like oculus backed investors   nt sell user info  plan make money selling digital goods  virtual avatars  environments  hats  etc   well collaborationproductivity addons businesses use bigscreen  2  re working cinema environment done couple months
ll retry  remember correctly makes screen dim  environmental lighting  home theater fine  mean big theater  although able dim room s lighting would great  putting 4 hours today  m thinking would nice could save  name  screen configurations  position  size  angle  curvature  2d3d  switch fly menu  screen conveniently set working computer  made ton modifications play 2d fps games huge wraparound screen  sweet   impossible go back previous config  numbers sliders would also help 
brightness affects entire screen  environment  nt remember going cinema kept lights movie  imo light dimming absolutely essential feature ca nt watch movie properly environment except one theatre environment s actually somewhat dark  seating one find great 
 assume mean like direct headset feature  idea would called  like  know sbs 3d videos  dont look right viewed screen isnt exactly right place 
hahah yes  least snl stuff interesting  get feeling ramping popularity something snl

excellent  thanks answering  2 interesting bigscreen aspects  already knew backed venture capitalists  wondered planned recoup money  desktop mirroring brilliant way allowing bluray surround audio already licensed software   since licensing fees might unrealistic vr market   put realistic cinema could make movie watching amazing  considered making first premium environment  believe s one exciting biscreen addons could possibly make  generate profit even improvements 
yeah  screen dims   grand theater  dim possible right  due limitation baked lighting  saving screen configurations good idea  ll think interface would look like 
m glad theaters stay relatively lit  cuts god rays 
might different issue  seen directtoheadset also called full screen lot  thought might meant 
really hope  enjoy snl stuff  nt compare youtube videos imo 
problem  s fun app sure  play non vr games big tv whatnot  unfortunately find still using virtual desktop multimonitor support  eagerly waiting developer finish  mainly use app desktop replacement  main feature friends hangout type thing  though fun 
correct  s necessary stream  necessary want simply receivehear people s desktop audio   aim integrate natively bigscreen later year  wo nt require 3rdparty installation 
cautious smart  hope nt screw anything  area tech fairly stable  since s messing kernel drivers windows audio  s prone failure  maybe setup windows restorebackup point case  yep works box  install banana  restart pc  click  start  button inside room bigscreen  bigscreen autoconfigure everything 
generally due cpu  i7 broadwellskylakekaby lake desktop cpus handle 1080p30 encoding realtime  re working fixes get around limitation changing media encoder works 
later 2017  yes  plans virtual monitors 
better still would cropping stretchstretchtofillscreen type options  ultimate flexibility 
 thanks
maybe help  vive always seems like s barely focus  ve tried  eyes measurement  slider  ve tried knobs connected straps  nothing seems fix  nt get people play nonvr games vive  seems like s slightly low res makes sense ideas 
cool  ll wait  nt want mess system audio 
gotcha  creating restore point smart idea   nt forsee problems  nt familiar vmb  hey  might useful ways  oh  hey  ve got attention  steam vr break steam game launching bigscreen  always enable desktop theatre d rather play retro 2d bigscreen environments  got hooked playing darkest dungeon campfire environment 
already utilise things nvenc vce 
i7 6800k overclocked  told desktop stream looks like slideshow
unfortunately resolution current hmd s always bit blurryout focus  nature current resolution blown 4  eyes   however yes  finding sweet spot help  line eyes directly middle lens  people say lower vive goes face helps  ve much issue finding sweet spot  aside fact things get close face  split start becoming 2 m crossing eyes   power supersampling using advanced settings third party tool  depending graphics card helps substantially  980  set 1213 play around bit find works best  going high settings destroy framerate  even little helps quite bit  edit  link https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments5nldxoblurryviveifixedit

m aware  check steam settings changed  info  http  bigscreenvrcomhelpgettingstartedsteamgames

s lot problems happening  people receiving end might cpu new enough decode 1080p30 realtime media decoder  results machine trying software decoding instead hardware accelerated decoding  re lot work area  including update couple weeks improve streaming  outbound inbound   expect significantly better summer – re revamping entire way media streaming works bigscreen leave  beta  launch 10 
supersampling thing helps  always max  try lowering hmd bit thanks linkl
assume s something like soundflower  allows mess audio ios  runs background time  actually nt want deal  another sound app sys tray  could wrong though 
 m sure ll get working  thank amazing program 
m sure re obviously aware existence probably already looked using  d seriously recommend  utilise dedicated encoding hardware gpu  really aleviate lot stress rest system 
ok thankyou 
things look   lower desktop resolution  disable xbox dvr  nvidia gamestream  etc   disable flux  restart video stream  green video icon room ui  occasionally

m musician s still much fun  s great see work ve put  ll definitely check new update 
sequencer  adsr envelopes  midi  excellent  
one first vr purchases back june  little musical knowledge nt done much soundstage  like others said s well implemented solid experience  simple feature request  using touchpad reset dials default position  maybe snap values  s really fiddly trying change back something 100   like sample speed volume 
hey logan  looks awesome  thinking buying  2 things d like know  1 last time read something soundstage nt possible sortorganize imported samples  recall correctly  kind folderbrowser system  2 midioutin awesome  main reason buy   kind latency 
pretty cool  put stage lasers fog machines massive crowd feet 
sweet  thanks hard work 
awesoooooome 
adsr huge deal 
 deleted 
latency problem solved  ll happy  made playing drums impossible  actually wondering way add asio support 
app amazing  fantastic freaking work man  would recommend  1 best app vr  least humble opinion  also note m musically challenged nt able make single decent sounding song yet  s amazingly fun  s like owning thousands dollars worth musical equipment 
congratulations soundsstage  quite achievement   
looks amazing makes wish creative 
wondering multiplayer could added lag would ruin  ever experimented 
focus usability access knowledge tools update really like 
still nt soundstage amount work went interface alone impressive  keep 
word lie  talking brother game 2 days ago  saying loved  saying want something standard midi gui  looking forward giving another go 
hope midi implementation good  actually use real tool 
keeps getting better better  ve hoping vst plugin incorporation point  nt take impatient demand  awesome  love 
awwww yiss  time hook midi keyboard one 
awesome app  glad see enhancements  vr music creation awesome
im mostly looking forward new multitrack timeline  bc im used adobe effects timelines would easy get used
disassembled music room make vr room  find space keyboard  congratulations man 
really cool application
bought app day released  congrats hard work 
congrats release   time long weekend monday holiday   
buying vive later summer  top go try list   10 well  fucking great deal man  love
love see use cases vr outside gaming  congrats release 10  looks really cool    
oh sweet

thought logan  looked familiar   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vk2hsoqbqoa 
 midi  could build vr studio reason 
bought
bought  love video tutorials part component  great touch 
bought 8 months ago  played hours week two forgot  really need give another go  sequencer looks awesome 
congrats 10 release 
soundstage quillmediumtiltbrushkodon audio vr
planning sale time soon  would love pick lots vr games buy  
yup  s really inspiring  feels like quality sneak peek future 
thank 
midi available wondering could add leap motion support  would awesome able see hands playing keyboard  thanks 
great  load midi files soundstage ll auto load instruments 
thank 
appreciate 
agree reset would nice  could nt get something implemented happy  underestimated important following functions would  copy  delete  reset  multiselect  something keep mind re developing creative application 
 1  organize custom samples one layer deep  folders nested folders   2  nt perceive latency  m musician maybe tolerances lower 
 deleted 
could real ones  controlled via midi   
thanks note 
woooooooo 
thanks 
m familiar soundstage  drums using midi try installing different midi synthesizer like virtualmidisynth  default windows midi synthesizer really bad latency 
copypaste response   per linked release notes  soundstage gives high level access size  choose 3 options  fast  balanced  audio quality   
thanks  appreciate kind words

hopefully midi io use vsts daw choice use interface 
thank 
ll see think 
thank
thank support  still show drum experiments video folks 
thanks  happy holiday 
nongaming apps  also check tvori mindshow 
believe wave enters early access soon  http  thewavevrcom think primary appeal using vr professional music composition performative right  s way easier efficient professional build music outside vr  hoping soundstage would make building process look feel cooler  well help audience understand music built 
thank 
thanks 
dude one worth full price 
oooh bonus points  could rescale keyboards game  could calibrate locations scale notes ingame keyboard irl piano  could use leapmotion translate irl playing virtual midi recording  gah  want thing 
midi file support  sorry  saving loading  custom xml file 
yeah  s m wondering midi routing works  maybe s much faster sounds triggered outside vr
pc soundcard digital processing adds heaps latency solve latency problem using digital outputs soundcard playing guita  rocksmith  using soundstage  instead standard optical digital  switch standard analogue headphone output  goes aux amp  still latency  much less  switch amp  pure  mode processing  makes huge difference zero latency 
ca nt believe never thought  midi drivers due multiple sound cardsinterfaces  try alternate drivers see helps 
actually  think m good 
nt need real time  passing save files quickly friends  even offline  would amazing  imagine mailbox block  music workspace snail mail 
hmm  tweaking vst controls  rather try render vst controls vr  able incorporate pop desktop view steamvr  could pop open huge desktop window tweak vst settings still vr  could probably double click steam menu button jump desktop  issue desktop controls usable onscreen pointer controllers view  try little later see goes  hmm works could using tech similar vr videos  could arrange vst s screen capture parts screen use separate windows vr  could pop open resize get access key vst controls within vr    
 deleted 
ll think
ca nt already rescale pretty much everything 
imagine top add  synthesia style gameplay  would perfect learning piano
hmm  thought supported midi 
latency audio tied size audio buffer  smaller buffer  lower latency  also increase glitches pops  daws give access size buffer  per linked release notes  soundstage gives high level access size  choose 3 options  fast  balanced  audio quality  
oh share save files  xml files  open folder containing desktop window menu 
man tried midi xylo roll vst instruments works really well  though soundstage simply use steam vr option display windows desktop vr could select vst devices windows tweak settings  important note stand windows gs wavetable midi device bad latency issues nt let put  use good quality virtual midi device  latency  use acoustica mixcraft daw  inexpensive  also give good supply loops samples  added whole heap vst plugins used free program loopbe1 virtual midi device  works perfectly without latency  simply use steam vr desktop vr bring windows screen  select relevant vst tweak dials         big smile oh one note  reason click little loopbe1 window steam vr would steal mouse vive controller would interact desktop anymore  use real mouse click outside window get full desktop control controllers 
nt sure added keys  actually makes keys wider 
midi communication  send midi messages program  save load midi files 
asio driver support solution latency issues us hardware support  something roadmap  realize nt something relevant core market  m sure m one s got eye soundstage s potential professional application  asio support necessary use case  record though  think ve done soundstage amazing  congrats 10 release 
need discord chat something fun hotswap  ever get grouping system sort thing let combine multiple xml files one area 
makes keys wider 
 extends left side  blows subwoofer 
ca nt load multiple inapp think copy pasted xml files might work  knows  
1 leap motion support   thanks awesome app 
google s released audio factory vive

interesting  wonder compares steam audio 
anyone found link sdk   please see website link page  end page  edit  googles url 404 currently  found github https  githubcomresonanceaudioresonanceaudiounitysdkreleases
become soundstage acquisition 
https  wwwbloggoogleproductsgooglevrresonanceaudiomultiplatformspatialaudioscale
wow  looks great  google making ton great stuff vr  valve would ramp little bit part 
seemed kind loud  thought invisible hours better spacial sound 
seriously impressive  really liked  seriously shame ca nt repeat end sequence 
interesting  wonder soundstage dev 
 hope audiophile good comparison  maybe compare “ dearvr ” unity asset 
think    http  unitylistcomreg7resonanceaudiounitysdk   github   https  githubcomresonanceaudioresonanceaudiounitysdkreleases 
nt suppose documentation explain use  see couple demos inside backengineering without actual documentation pretty hard 
m pretty sure daydream audio sdk rebranded name resonance 
likely  wo nt surprised also helped updates google blocks tilt brush 
 google making ton great stuff vr  acquire flight simulator startup add google earth 
thought valve real games works  basically tech demo show google s resonance api 
nt  short uninteresting 
careful  re blindly assuming 3 vr games coming next week  kind thinking dangerous around 
work unreal  s take  wide source computation  point sources  works unreal s reverb volumes  s documented  control source  reverb settings blueprints 
url  probably tommorow https  developersgooglecomresonanceaudiodevelopunitygettingstarted
 steps google taking bring daydream content vive good book 
really hope soundstage makes reappearance  soundstage incredible  ’ make sense practice anymore ’ abandoned 
ultrawings would pretty cool way explore google earth 
pretty sure one flight sims allow import data google earth  newest xplane think  would sweet google add halfway decent flight sim directly earth vr though 
yes currently working three vrrelated games  want information though
end holidays  beginning 2018 actually s common   followed closely   screw  s valve  idea    would require know re talking miss opportunity make pithy comment  ca nt 
cool  thanks  reading  https  developersgooglecomvrconceptsspatialaudio definitely sounds sophisticated unity s normal 3d audio 
ultrawings controls  sure  m flying atl lax glider  want big planes many knobs levers know 
s flat terrain  3d models real reason flying around google earth awesome 
know valve feels number 3 
 absolutely  valve traditionally guarded re working  vive example  working inhouse tech long oculus  nt start banging drum production partner actually manufacture device  thing  nt want say anything something concrete say  kind opposite hello games  guess 
sounds amazing also sounds wildly optimistic valve  information indicate release soon 
yeah  think games 2 4 months away  based  evidence valve anything besides sitting hands  re busy making media players playing hardware prototypes make games  know  set bot remind comment m going hassle every 45 days  hope like idea  enjoy  re going buddies looong time  guy  love good fight 
use actual flight sim   know xplane 11 due get vive support  full motion controls  week  google earth data cool pretty  meh  get close compared s actual flight sims  area nt even 3d mountains google earth  let alone buildings  xplane much  much better representation area  may everything  least nt flat plane weirdly projects pictures town 
think standard valve  s done  approach bad choice case  trying jumpstart whole new platform market  need step game accordingly  community generally unhappy business usual output regard 
much  people think games come new knuckles controllers  would silly valve make three games called vr experiments  use latest hardware   devs receiving knuckles versions  much else happened since  personally  m hopeful m holding breath either 
 know  set bot remind comment m going hassle every 45 days  hope like idea  enjoy  re going buddies looong time  guy  love good fight  yeah  ohkay imma report comment treating haras person  know guy also dick  seriously 
lmao matter  bad day 
well  parts google earth 3d looks far superior anything ever saw flight sims  totaly smooth  20 supersamping   least  stay 100 meters groundlevel  everything looks like molten plastic  planes rarely low  arent     
yeah  well  re probably expecting eventual release blow away unhappiness  looking track record likely right   one  happy wait  ll s  much information project influence even slightest  info competitors  however  likely ll make smaller splash otherwise would 
valve patient community general  seem feel like vr going important part gaming future  obviously want steam big part vr s future  nt seem huge hurry get point  think valve feels like hardware nt good enough  cheap enough  vr go mainstream yet  nt pushing hard right  people think valve released awesome aaa game vr  would sell millions headsets jump start industry  nt think s case  d maybe sell thousands extra headsets  reality full blown pc vr system still expensive mainstream  first generation hardware ton obvious shortcomings  years  ll significantly better hardware available lower prices  well better underlying software  s market really prime vr start going mainstream  course  meantime  us ve already jumped vr would love awesome content sooner rather later  valve s playing longer game  ve got revenue resources patient  oculus  hand  exists solely vr  result  re pushing much harder vr go mainstream asap  lot ways  re acting mainstream market beginning  ve prioritized polish much valve  re funding aaa level studios create content  neither approach necessarily right wrong  re coming different perspectives 
nice edit  completely changing comment bud 
think good compromise would xplane 3d airports already exist fairly accurate well highly detailed combined terrain google earth rest world  without compromise  personally prefer close detail get approximating areas premade modular assets  cost 11 accuracy d see google earth  see changing easily google earth improves expands 3d reach  though 
 deleted 
may blow everyone away several reasons 
well course agree valve releasing aaa game going sell millions headsets magically kick industry mainstream  s likely single product game would  share confidence valve far playing long game firm strategy  seen direct evidence  lack information reassurance point  could argue protective intellectual property highly competitive new market trying make wise decisions  could argue always setting platform everyone else work collect fees maybe sell hats  look outside  changing tactics communicating little bit would really send signal business usual   much hate facebook oculus walled garden philosophy  agree vr funding focus polish  clearly far money burn valve willing take risks  facebookowned walled garden  might even bought oculus secondary headset vive  least know perspective position  valve s big guessing game  nt think s best method create healthy market 
valve company earns money steam stock company  owes nothing anyone  pressure  said  development part company need profitable  need sell anything  extraordinary talented people work  funny interesting stuff  need economically profitable  everyone suposedly works something wants work atm  heshes mood  works something else  thats  done done  thing originates     also  know  second time fun  third time  meh  please  right one could make profit something third time  remember  profit  fun   d least thats myth company established face outsiders  would explain lot things  would truth   d
dcs world looks worse google earth vr constant reprojection ss 14 google earth perfectly smooth without reprojection ss 40 also  dcs world areas look totaly boring everything looks identical somehow  also looks fake  google earth vr gives lifelike apearance   talking  lifelike   love fact  even see damn car   well  blob close  100m height looks fine  google earth vr 3d areas 2 gb per square kilometer  makes 10x10km area 200gb geometry texture data  wich arrive stream  flightsims stream data need install 200gb area data hdd  find google earth vr totaly absolutely superior dcs world least  never tried xplane 
yeah  well  m passing judgement s available judge   might  suck  sure   might  awesome  m guesstimating ll polished  whatever  ll game play much graphics whatever else  ve come something original really works well vr  ll pleased  release polished smooth wave shooter ever  ll sharpening torch lighting pitchfork rest mob 
could great  certainly polished  many potential factors  think people keep expectations modest  valve famously anti freelocomotion one  nt budged position matter fantastic efforts  going disappointing interesting sizable percentage people 
yeah  well   personally  nt mind hippetyhoppetylocomotion  plenty people fed wave shooters

combined new strap tpcast  fits well whole package exactly lightweight  vive set 6mm vrcover faux leather facial padding  initially nt dig comfort level struggled consider improvement  tightened top velcro strap  fidgety tpcast tbh  replaced 6mm padding original one  world difference  could tighten comfortably stable  overall felt  better balanced hmd  direct comparison rift still feels nimble  s definite improvement original straps  old 3in1 though  d pissed 
nt think commerical rigid headstrap yet makes hmd hold  completely  still shaking head one side another  experienced vive  rift  psvr  experience welding headgear mod revolve   ski mask  straps old headstrap could make fit snuggly  though  sacrifices comfort  however  personally feel wobbles significantly  play intense games like holopoint thrill fight fine new headstrap  maybe racketnx even intense   nt game  edit  sure picture accurate  maybe try tighten top strap usual  personally ve found tighten old headstrap 
post pic head formation analysis 
wireless headphones anchor old strap head pretty well thankfully  good know new strap good people  wish could trial thing biting 
nt need duct tape  guy posted original thing 3in1 issues fixed one extra piece velcro  https  iimgurcomsznb4odjpg issue seems top strap becomes hard adjust wearing cable goes top 
try add foam sides fit tiny head 
nt new strap come something hold 3 1 cable place  someone else received said  believe  s separate piece unless misunderstanding 
oh shame  alternate sold two fake delivery dates  pushed back next month  gluck im ungluck  would seem  ask buying newer cable  might fit head set better  s going make headset firmer head  keep us updated 
m going try live old style cable head strap long possible  ve less got fitting like glove  earbud routing  etc  fabric material starting fray  though  certainly understand complaints learning curve  attach thing face properly  takes time  recent trick found push cable slack top headset  loosens whole thing  prior attaching hmd directly face then pull strap back head  helps prevent skin funk getting lenses  m disciplined take  though  imagine  yeah black magic  truly got mine correct  vive also looks coolest  think  m excited headstrap wireless  maybe m sour puss  free cable extension stuff lying around really paying  d actually need beanbag chair  wireless keyboard integrated mouse comfortable viewing  experience desk  30x29 aint largest play space either 
well  continue really unhappy  d probably buy 
oh shame  alternate sold two fake delivery dates  pushed back next month  gluck im ungluck  would seem  ask buying newer cable  might fit head set better  s going make headset firmer head  keep us updated 
feels vive headset  like fit fov  adjusted face foam craft knife made good  m prepared das  want integrated headcans mostly  perfect fit shy making modifications  preordered b  h looks like shipping launch date 
 u feel teh cable back  hard explain exactly thought
original headstrap leaves lot desired  ve tinkered enough played around vr covers fine tuned adjustments get zero wobble even m spinning yet facerest feels like snug pillow hard  m pretty bummed designed new 3 1 cable  prefer old one  still probably pick new headstrap 
maybe odd shaped head  standard headstrap perfectly comfortable  audio technica headphones come interchangeable cables  inclunding short one  cables issue eiither  wo nt bothering get  tpcast though  s different matter 
sound compare rifts headphones 
mine old 3in1 cable  difference night day love  works totally fine old cable tucked side velcro d back
m probably going modding get deluxe audio strap  thinking modifying weight gets distributed forehead  kind like current welding mask mod  http  imgurcomuhluh3f
okay time test new headstrap 45 minutes m busy m happy say   think s great    comfort roof sound quality excellent  route  also old  3 1 cable side back one velcro nt seem problems far 
m curious ve adjusted top strap 
nt think ll cancelling preorder  m looking forward strap s easy put multiple people along integrated audio  currently use phones headsets hate plugging honestly small hassle feels lot larger    major complaint old strap weight distribution  use welding mask mod like found could put lot pressure back skull  could ve modded suppose  way front modded difficult making work heads  also shabby looking  maybe could tweak new strap bit get perfect  could always return  wish could trade hmd new lighter model  p every little bit counts 
look getting cable tie anchors like    https  wwwmonopricecommobileproductdetails5860  gclidcjwkeajw3ptjbrchgz3e7syhaksjaasg9vr3vuv0xqmxsbobfozvehsepjs2wzkeacvqedaqco5xockhbwwcb   also come black  secure cable top headset 
sounds like rift headstrap still king  maybe m going wait something like lg headset get best comfort combined steamvr 
yup  seems like htc messed  ca nt design ergonomic headstrap  pity  spent much money accessory burned  bought retailer look store s return policy 
since re one know deluxe strap tpcast  overall would compare experience compared normal strap cord  meh  50  better  2x better  feedback would helpful  better comparison could give rift strap  m getting regardless would like make sure nt overhype 
nt complain fiddly top strap  tpcast gods sake   kidding  though  similar experience  initially used configure new headstrap  feels quite nice 
actually rift sits really good  thats straps  also front weights 270g 
rift best job head perspective  general like vive tho  pure ergonomics riftz king  alsthough u r rright completely fixed wouldnt lighter may movement would 
agreed  half kilo face always wobble move head right left  unless glue stuff face  would probably still wobble bit   get solved retina display couple centuries 
ll get phrenology calipers

 s shame s nowhere try buying  s 150€ strap find lot money something m even sure fit head glasses 
s part plan buying amazon  ll return needed 
need strap every microcenter microsoft store try 
yes cable works ok great reasonable alright 
shrinks far head size child using  nt mean grips properly correct size 
s velcro band  want route old cable top  d need another one  s picture new headstrap old cable  included velcro strap put bottom back part new headstrap  http  imgurcomqzgjrps note velcro loop actually go underneath foam  
fits new strap  old 
might sense would less pull cord  newer cord slimmer lighter could make noticeable difference

fyi  5 min chat vive support got new head set strap free charge  head strap nt age well guess know 
s largest trust  upper echelon vivers 30x29  think common closer 25x15

expectatrions high think  order new cable vr cover  think least little improvement 
got used start like also better better great  lets see ne cable arrives today 
yes tried movin picture becomes clear like old one also made sure back really holds behind sits  think design error whole thing needs tightening options side  wheel great general qiuality good price  dont nall head poc ski helmet ml  dont want imagine problem people sized heads  hope overdramatize see lot disappointed customers coming soon 
agree  tp cast seems like fit supported much better deluxe strap s firm parts original flexible strap 
hold  let s wait feedback assume nt work people  ve heard good feedback negative ll see 
even rvive  troll complain  leave make everyone else happy  contribute nothing roculus subreddit  re entire waste internetbandwith

one big fat ugly troll
see keep  look attention get  m kinda jealous 
switch cable tpcast substantial  initially felt somewhat strange adjusted requirements cable  passed roamed freely really started appreciate playspace center overlay lost physical orientation room  felt pretty vive 15ish first discovered wonders ss  new headstrap definite improvement well balancing vive s ergonomic challenges  compared rift d put even close even comfort levels  rift still bit ahead due s lower weight  d compare new headstrap putting 4wheel drive large saloon car  yes  way stability improve handling  wo nt change physics 
feel change weight setup  give setup good whirl weekend  really looking forward 
used rift dozen times never complete  snuggly fit except really tightened side straps  causing infamous oculus  face  m one saying  look cnet video giving tips wear rift  https  wwwcnetcomhowtoadjusttheoculusriftperfectfit 049   shake head little bit moves  s perfectly fine    true  perfectly fine  still wobble bit 
 deleted 
 glasses  wear glasses audio deluxe headstrap improvement glasses nt get stuck  vive anymore taking vive 
would nice currently put headphones kids first headset headphones stretch strap 
note  clever  shall adjust 
s actually lighter  read around comments people actually weighed using kitchen scale something similar 
say new headstrap mean new one replacement fabricelastic one 
think asking tried pulling top velcro strap tighter  looks loose picture provided  would adjustment front back would think 
rigid strap going fix smaller heads  unless designed   originally came soft straps  fit people  already planning 3d printing something 2 year 4 year old put first even soft straps dont fit  big old head sure fine 
guy oculus troll downvote move
 rift still bit ahead due s lower weight iirc  read newer vive headsets sold slightly  lower  weight rift  nt help us folks earlier vive models  eh 
exactly expecting glad hear someone experience  hope start shipping tpcast us soon  wonder benefit noticeable 15  lighter vive  wish could tradein 
another question  tried laying  m curious   1  comfortable new strap  knob rigidity main concern   2  may affect tpcast tracking  less important concern 
weight overall unit  nt seem different even though rigid headstrap add grams whole hmd  felt like need keep headstrap low old one  nt cup back skull anymore  instead needed tighten top strap m used  afterwards felt comfortable weight front box less noticeable  guess varies lot depending head shape 
vive flatmate rift ve spent tens hours using  rift far away comfortable  ve spent entire day vive face multiple times problems s practical issue 
might well true  fast head movements still outpaces vive psvr huge margin  shake head quickly rift hmd   manages stay halfway position  vive dances around face didnt push psvr hard suspected ittl fly 
imagined palmer luckey sexy cosplay second 
headstrap might little tight 
fan boy seizure mid sentence 
using vive 1 day immediately ordered lens inserts avoid using glasses 
old strap also goes small enough ca nt wear probably vr  companies like sony oculus say 13 really s get 7 research starts get scary  nt put kids 7 care vr  could big deal  could cause lasting damage  worth five minutes fun 
new old one  lol clearly  get free replacement fabricelastic head strap simply asking   least  rma etc 
 might tight sides tight enough top  loosen sides first  get top comfortable  tighten sides
safe put kids young vr 
even total weight new vive lower  distribution still much front heavy rift  saw someone thread claim 270g front end rift  sure firm figures anywhere  lower weight helps  s probably huge difference 
try let know
one things wondering people wrong  original strap worked best low cupping base skull  way strap setup seemed would work higher  purely speculating base understanding though nt yet 
sounds like nt wear vive properly  elastic headstrap  allows much better fit many different head shapes  cause less comfort compared rigid headstraps  gives lot stability experience moving around  definitely nt dance around face   coming someone loves active games like thrill fight need good fit games quickly move head  dodge attacks etc  rift similar problem like new deluxe audio strap due using rigid headstrap nt accommodate head shape well   using glasses rift nt comfortable experience  
yup  rift still king comfort wise enabling fast movements  anyone else claims vive iswas better rift regard simply lying  majority people never tried rift extended period time  know re missing comfortwise

would say safer playing phone tablet convergence distance meter  think 2 meters    tablet phone held foot face time  usually play 20 30 min getting bored  like anything  much anything bad thing long spending day problem 
origional vive  wife got newer revision  much noticeably lighter  im shocked every time pick really lighter  new 3in1 cables 
far many variables one person another  thin pleather replacement foam padding  tighten point nt wiggle  comfortable  using stock padding  sacrifice bigger sweet spot fov comfort meaning get wiggle maintain comfort  everyone s head size shape different  barely use damn strap head big top strap literally full slack fit noggin 
vive ve tried rift  personally rift clear ergonomics winner nt want support closed eco system think lighthouse tracking worth less perfect head strap 
dood physics nothing else  vives front part nearly twice heavy rifts  rifts side straps spring loaded adjustable force  far  rigid  
reports people tested deluxe audio strap press releases claimed bested rift psvr comfort  psvr supposed better rift comfort 
d love live mind one day bask simplicity 
https  vrlenseuhtcvivelensinsertshtml get site  vr lens site  cost depends prescription  shitty eye sight ended costing 109 dollars  well worth though  better fov  comfort  worrying scratching lenses glasses 
agree  comfort fit heavily depends individual head shape  however  lenne strongly claims nt true the rift always better  agree  eg  rift make really stop wiggling  d get oculus face  pretty quickly 
rigid terms bending inwardsoutwards much elastic strap  maybe experience differed mine  vive better fast experiences  edit  demonstration springloaded strap  https  ifixitguideobjectss3amazonawscomigovideoifixitspa2lycjbnhxdupqmp4592mp4
nt talking new strap s technically yet  almost nobody one 
dude  come  everyone owns knows damn well rift edge comfort  s nothing overly simplistic statement 
nt devices allow something like currently  maybe future   nt see s wrong post  objectively true  know hmds 
holy mother god legend 
confirm  lens inserts vr lens lab  work well enough cost  barrel distortion ungodly  got used s still noticeable sometimes  definitely order vrlenseu 
well according research  many claim psvr beats oculus comfort deluxe audio strap beats psvr comfort old vive strap dead last  guess ll find june 
seemingly physics defiyngly different  yes 
lol fucking serious  title post  got   deluxe audio strap   alternate today well dont like   entire fucking context conversation new fucking strap  also post week ago  one cares anymore also   almost nobody one  true  actually quite people got early 
vive das 
man  
np  end getting  enjoy  shipping pretty quick  ship germany got states 2 weeks 
psvr feels awesome  really suited roomscale gaming due loose  seated standing experiences really feel comfortable experience 
think re suffering sort psychological breakdown  seem overreacting absurd degree benign comment internet  smoke bowl  take valium  something calm rational discussion  uyellowturdbig op  mmkay   never  mentioned deluxe audio strap odds s even officially released yet extremely slim  ordered one specific european retailer  go away take vitriol 
das released yet  course  seriously s going specific comment chain  everyone assumes already das referring vive w das  never said vive w das  said vive 
bad shipping  beats alliexpress lol
mean  m fat guy s like moves swift agile vive anyway lol 
lol douche bag troll
troll clearly  ca nt calm talk like intellectual human see reason respond  calling people names nothing progress conversation  s likely selfesteem exceptionally low behave manner make feel better  providing brief false sense superiority  person help   want  better person 
concerrrrrrn trollllll
s still sale deluxe audio strap alone s crime 
people buy bundle get free das  bought vive long ago still full price  black friday   never sale 
feel like always chance cyber monday thing  dream nt dead yet  m  though  would impulse bought decent enough discount 
three threads lack das sale black friday  ll echo said others  another example htc zero existing customer loyalty  also evidenced apparently abysmal warranty support   get early adopter means pay tech live growing pains  also heard das originally going standard vive  frankly  das obviously overpriced  would show customer care htc s part throw us og users bone simply put accessory sale  new windows mr headsets went sale similar head mounting solutions built  cheaper  main difference total bundle vive point required lighthouse tech  makes better tracking also niche audience willing fixed playspace vr spend extra time money setting  oh  m also buying fallout vr full price  fuck  right 
yeah  shame  nice bit kit  bought one long release  see quite hit many  moneywise 
m going get welding mask counterbalance
d buy one heartbeat went sale  long new buyers vive getting crazy deals das bundled way hell would ever pay full price shit  already got shafted buying vive day 1  going early adopter das well 
early adopters tax guess  although das 100  better original strap worth 
’ building adoption  ’ sure htc ’ future quite secure enough prioritize rewarding existing adopters 
fair  popularity thread  thus associated demand product  perfectly good reason   sale 
htc cheap skates  wo nt discount anything unless feel choice matter 
overhyped product overhyped  save money
also waiting price drop  ve seen bundles recently reluctant pay £99 one early purchaser vive  cracked weekend ordered one  whole family love vive  negative reaction adjustment original head strap changing users  hopefully end issues   ca nt wait try 
vive s getting bit old might die soon    wait another 6 months almost giving away  competition coming  would buy new strap  guess lot people thinking way  especially pimax backers pimax voyeurs  last thing considering spending money vive   combination high price point basically bit plastic s kept getting one tbh  £40 add maybe £60 headphones good   £58 would phones  
audio quality even worth good headphones  ve got krakens 
bought one anyway  amazon 
planning buying one hit 60 percent  lmao sale joke
long capitalism nt considered crime  things like also crime  think valve used test vr hardware team fortress 2 medical applications  putting game like vr make crap load money  medical apps wo nt 
 vive  das  fo4 deal weeklong   https  wwwvivecomusviveblackfridaycybermondaydealdeluxeaudiostrap  announced sales weeks ago bet going put sale das  d know
although another upside lighthouse tech ll able use knuckles  ca nt imagine insideout knuckles alternative mr 
 ll echo said others  another example htc zero existing customer loyalty  maybe  maybe  htc crunched numbers decided nt want repeat mistakes made smartphone space  shitty margins low volume sales nearly bankrupted  dropped price vive  200  three months ago  order fight price war oculus microsoft mr partners  meaning acer  dell  hp  lenovo  samsung   plus need compete holiday sales psvr   companies much deeper products multiple product lines support   maybe sell handful less vive das result  maybe upset people internet  maybe keeps going business result 
hmm pretty good experience customer support  208 error headset could nt recognized walked bunch things try  granted nt instant response  nt time solve one night anyways  also finally get working  found line dead pixels  shipped back repaired within couple weeks
’ already established das way better mod 
ll sell mine want already done  das longer need welders mod 
 already got shafted buying vive day 1 
used use sennheiser ears audio quality obviously better honestly nt really care  nice wear headphones top mask audio good enough 
sure obviously nt one  ve playing ear buds punch every ten minutes integrated audio must  also heard could remove headphones  would actually go sale could worth
audio ok stellar  nowhere near good rift audio dedicated headphones  still  strap makes vive way convenient comfortable 
re good enough convenience outweighs loss audio quality  course re fanatical audio quality probably 
60   seriously  chances zero 
wat
medical apps would make shitload money  reason valve nt make medical apps re doctors 
probably  also ca nt denied das nt nearly market appeal sexy hmd  s addon already hardcore item  s definitely niche item vive owners would even know 
 within couple weeks  applemicrosoftnintendolenovo gotten stuff back within week  ’ think would crazy htc  800 dollar device lenovo  250 thinkpad 
personally welding mask mod year went das think s much better  everybody agrees   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments7f5kvoshouldigetaviveexplanationinpostdqa0f9c  context3 
much 
 1350 cad vs paying  550 cad rift currently  year half later 
well  come  thought maybe would deep sales  s clear sales nt going happen
also makes sense think fact people nt das early adopters paid  800 vive disposable income  versus waiting sale like  however  bought vive used ca nt really spend  100 strap
s  25  whatever shipping want  live usps  fedex  ups   pm re interested 
 bought vive used ca nt really spend  100 strap work  briefly considered getting rift secondhand lack warranty knowledge someone else sweating headset im going use kept 
day one preorder  situations change  could afford time  right ca nt afford 100 dollars strap  would love see sale 
bought mine open box store  100 back  799 something clearly pretty well used got  base station failed 9 months replaced warranty  replacedbought extra foam things  added prescription lens inserts  recently added das 
hindsight probably nt great idea s pretty risky  got lucky  knock wood   used sanitation wipe also bought new face pad cheap  m also pretty close opposite germaphobe  m lucky failures  especially since ca nt really buy new vive controllers without spending arm leg oculus sells touch controllers  99 pair  reference  bought vive february previous owner bought november  said  price  especially rift  decreased much s probably much better spending extra coins buying one new  vive gone right refunded money go entire process  would consider getting new unit  windows mr headsets pretty enticing  actually almost bought one even though already vive  idea lighthouses cameras tracking quality comparable rift really tempting  bottom line  nt issues would still recommend new 
good  glad worked   idea lighthouses cameras tracking quality comparable rift really tempting  s really true controllers view  anything camera s field view close breaks tracking  stuff like adjusting headset scratching face cause annoying visual glitches wreck immersion  also need well lit play area  considering mr headset  bit research went rift  didnt feel like pros mr outweighed cons intended use  plus ive using computers technology long naive enough spend 50 bucks newly released product  re basically beta tester point 
please get mic mute button next audio mute 
sometimes get questions gf playing multiplayer game  would really like quick easy option mute mic needing talk someone outside vr  valve  get mic mute button steam overlay  thanks
s exactly guys want third party program called advanced vr settings mute button toggle  work link sorry  s useful tool

god yes  tripletap steam button mute toggle would work fine imagine much technical challenge hard accidentally hit 
post ronward d get torn shreds re cheat cant mute real life able vr  always chuckle think

totally  https  githubcommatzman666openvradvancedsettings s convenient permanent bind mute  leave settings page mic mute button  mute pressing steam button  aimclick  perfect super helpful 
use mute unmute  d love dedicated button dashboard  quick way mute need cough make noise would great 
 also set auto mute mic soon take headset  proximity sensor  
like use voicemeeter  great third party audio mixer interface change input output fly  multiple mic input sound output  could nt wrap head around horrible realtek driver  started using  great  switch regular microphone playing seated multiplayers  one problem  restart audio engine program pretty much every time start vive  definitely worth 
accidentally push time adjusting headset 
nt really understand point  nt controllers open menu button headset  s way interact  nt react mouse keyboard headlook  way controller  situation press button controller one head  seems like something working controllers never removed 
functions system button  pressing steam button controllers   useful using vive headset without controllers  using gamepad steering wheel  instance

star trek bridge commander 4 people room really annoying  ca nt mute mic game  ca nt mute others  every time someone speaks hear three players mics  super annoying
exactly  s curtesy anything  s hassle remember mute every different game 
people run place game  ca nt run whole lot perfectly steady aim real life either 
oh yeah  guys strange  remembered first released pushtotalk feature  still separate software   guy whining blaming ruining onward  went explain killed two people last onward match could hear breath  shithead possible anymore  even organized people try downvote thread oblivion 
shreds say 
right vive 3 buttons thing  one controller s steam buttons headset button could toggle mic 
tripletap button mute toggle  s need  dont need buttons 
advanced settings nt know option  fantastic 
recently skype call  steamvr still actice  mic working  muted windows settings  unmuted  would immediately mute  went times till remembered implemented automute feature hmd worn  rofl  defeated software 
s useful re playing game pad  bring overlay hmd button navigate game pad 
pick hmd first press button first  starts loading steamvr  get controller wrist straps power controllers  ready go  button use use first 
could single tap mute triple tap steamvr button 
mean headset nt even option open menu without controller  headset nt even camera open double press button  yea  thanks troll 
ve skype calls like  s even worse hearing speak delay  really limits flow speech 
ready room  adjust volumes everyone else  everyone run volume everyone else room  bonus  works two people room two people room far away  disclaimer  verified s possible zero incoming audio player  used reduce volume friend whose microphone  ehem  exhuberant  
s seated game  use headset pc including s mic  switch mic via incable controls 
use left trackpad move 
classic onward  exactly reason people would get upset  gaining advantage opponents noisy background  s little classic   first played didnt mic set literally everyone would team kill turned  realized annoying mute team mate 
s wife holding 
d rather hardwired switch  hmd 
tried push talk  find vastly useful  s pretty simple demoing familyfriends say grips work like walkietalkies 
god amongst men  nt hear enough 
turning controllers also launches steam vr

  disclaimer  verified s possible zero incoming audio player  used reduce volume friend whose microphone  ehem  exhuberant   yep  found  bottom 20  grayed ca nt actually mute  s probably one frustrating parts  included volume controls game specifically blocked going low mute
oh sure s ways  also turn mic control panel want  m saying d convenient option mute steam overlay like op suggests 
shreds  say 
d rather mic work first place unfortunately 
exactly  also asked additional option toggle mike instead hold button  dev said  d consider 
button using push talk  games using limited amount buttons controller 
oh know  way put vr stuff makes hmd button useful  therefore d like function stay 
re talking vive  headphones 
rats  noticed grey part hoping color scheme   explicitly  decide break   
compare turning mic via switch headphone cable going control panel  nt mean turn completely  mean switch needed 
check steamvr settings  little steamvr window desktop   make sure input source set headset mic vr turned 
set either grips — games use  s generally issue press one need speak 
find turned controllers already hmd  s tpcast  launch steamvr via controllers  hmd  picking poweredon controllers 
 deleted 
thanks suggestion ve literally tried everything  even made post tried suggestions everyone suggested  unfortunately htc vive could nt help either  works perfectly fine outside steam vr  even steam settings tests fine  second start steam vr though nt work  even though windows shows  s odd 
hmd hanging right controllers  guitar hangers  m also using 18mm foam things amazon  vr cover think seller    enough gap see nose area 
 headphone jack microphone built  would pay money get features could added software update  also  logitech headsets kind crap  sound bad  heavy  nt comfortable  break easily  d rather use tv audio use one gaming headphones 
steamvr constantly changing audio devices despite set  change  
every 15 minutes every often starting steam vr game swap audio random device  usually changed oculus  disabled  s making virtual audio cable default   ll go ahead change preferred audio device  speakers    change device    https  iimgurcomjhm1px8png  within 15 minutes randomly  swap option back well default windows device   https  iimgurcomexc0sqgpng   singlehandedly frustrating thing ve dealing since seems happen several times demo rift abruptly cutting audio requiring change 2 settings taking least 30 seconds  restarting gamedemo  makes experience lot taxing frustrating everyone trying enjoy vr games  ve also got oculus set use windows default  seems affect steamvr games  sorry seems place  figured sub might know best    update  think may motherboard    forgot previous audio issue audio devices would disconnect reconnect windows  causing small frame drop  sounds briefly cut white windows spams notification sounds would come back  happened every often nt much issue disabled windows notifications sounds  tried rma motherboard months told software issue  later said s fault nt covered warranty  gigabyte sucks ass  avoid  s warranty want pay manufacturer defect  contacted amazon moment ago offered replace free despite past 30 days  thinking  m assuming steamvr detects audio devices disconnected tries assign default one still  hope s issue  m expecting considering nt change audio devices  either way steamvr obey user configurations  adapt change  anyone know configs stored  m thinking may able set readonly 
try different usb port cable  preferably port back  could link box losing connection computer long enough windows sees getting  plugged back   cause switch vive s devices 
mine time  set change headphones turning vive back vive turning  works 50  time never see pattern  annoying  tried disabling audio components luck  someone mentioned audio comes via hdmi monitortv sometimes audio device name changes  messes vive  either way bugs way  m getting angry writing  phew  deep breath 
issue vive  running virtual audio cable tactile transducer  m running rampage v extreme mobo  although m sure s motherboard issue  s probably windows issue  seems windows likes take latest audio device make default shits giggles 
mine like  turned something advance settings open vr 
steamvr config file  steaminstallfolder  configsteamvrsettings inside hardware ids chosen devices switch starting stopping  nt experimented setting file readonly guess could work  steamvr may s  switch happens startup exit  s switching somewhere else experience  think s windows setting default playback device whatever comes first disconnection issue  usb could causing general problem  maybe see happens connect link box different usb port  re usb 3 see usb 2 port helps  vice versa 
 deleted 
drived crazy past months  never understood behaves like  sometimes happens time  nothing weeks  weird
happens time  transducer set 2 soundcards always switches wrong one  drives nuts 
glad someone posted  exactly issue  thought  see openvr settings suggested make difference 
issue  even made thread month ago  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments72us8csteamvrfreezeandaudioloss s easily frustrating issue  nothing kills joy good multiplayer game spend 10 minutes fixing audio restarting game afterward  asus motherboard audio issues usual headphones  edit  would nt bad games would detect audio device changed automatically fix  regular games functionality none vr games 
well  nt really know oculus might affect  run weird audio device issues  solution go playback devices list windows disable devices except one want use  windows flaky audio devices experience way ensure want 
happen switching goes sync wont switch properly  dont rift btw
ve similar issue audio gets set  listen  green telephone icon rather defaulted icon  cause inconsistent idea s happening 
mine time  got use
instead setting  change   use software called voicemeeter banana creates virtual audio device set device default  using voicemeeter  select speakers  headset  vive audio list output devices choose one   want audio sent  s little confusing set first  way worth used multiple capacities  https  wwwvbaudiocomvoicemeeterbananahtm
disable ones play  experiencing power surges  dishwasher starts audio cuts second 
chiming happening  one night though  fit rage disabled usb audio device could watch bluray  audio refused go anywhere besides usb  figured d fix next time wanted vr defaulted hdmi audio still worked headphones das  well guess  audio switching works perfectly reason  nt fiddle steam settings sound devices windows 
s ever stick nt unplug vive  usually unplug usually breaks
sometimes front panel jack detection  computer case becomes faulty  realtek control panel option disable  see problem still happens disabled 
urgh  audio device management shit show steam vr  least weekly forget  settings fail switch hdmi audio vr  nt realise m ingame exit  reconfigure  relaunch etc  really wish could work hood steam vr well building exotic spaces people use home environments 
mine used lately everything working perfectly  d love know cause though case happens
find panel screwed forget plug headset launching steamvr  probably gets confused devices available system nt match remembers  lines theory pretty well 
might long shot steamvrvrsettings file inside steamconfig made  readonly  chance  right click file select  properties   make sure relevant entry   ticked 
happens time  put headset hear audio use desktop button steam vr access settings monitor window change back  takes effect immediately   settings stuff like ca nt accessed directly vr rather desktop another question  
windows switched new audio device   oh plugged  let helpful switch  steamvr issue 
please please check openvr advance settings installed  issue realised reset audio options headset advanced settings  stopped changing audio weird stuff 
mic  pattern m expecting 
motherboard issue mine  run ubuntu constantly notifications spamming audio devices reconnected  definitely issue  steam reason changing option  change  whatever wants 
 deleted 
s m using  setting voicemeeter  change  either one still gets swapped 
front panel audio ports case backwards  mic speakers   even completely disconnected nt help 
stopped happening switched usb audio instead hdmi  usb one available time link box connected  hdmi one appears steamvr started hmd  think s problem lies  steamvr goes switch preferred audio device nt actually  clears setting sets switch anymore  since hdmi one sometimes nt come immediately  switches names sometimes  seems makes steamvr forget  usb audio always  using problem quite time 
every option one stays set  s currently readonly  though maybe set way needs set readonly 
steamvr swaps s option random unrelated device  steamvr nt open happen  steamvr issue 
check openvr advanced settings headset  installed   changing audio steamvr options said 
going virtual audio device mirror sound device vive sound card pc ll add extra latency  latency annoying something like rhythm game  already 3rd party apps like virtual audio cable  s whole lot reason  purpose isolate vr audio recordingstreaming purposes nt get things like email alertsskype calls recordings  concept fine 
unless disconnecting cable motherboard  still trigger even without speaks mic plugged  try disabling software  also ports backwards  see front panel cable label like hd audio  ac97  make sure s set match bios audio settings

resisted week irritated  100 usd addon  owned rift well  knew better comfort like  finally ordered punishing end  agree  das fantastic placed right way  much comfortable  definitely worth 
one way  hard remove original strap install  pitfalls avoid

ve viving year half  kept putting das today  went microsoft store mall  walked strap  s awesome  wait long   s harder kids use  put small towel back strap fit fine 
purchased winter steam deal included das  came today playing around imagine sticking original strap  feel lucky mine included 
expensive yeah think s really needed want spend lot time vr play active games 
problem 3 1 cables old straps  basically replace 2 4  6 months  already  seems like das lowers critical stress cable due different cable management  s gon na save money long run apart huge leap comfort 
love das one working ear  like fact put speakers away independently  put one use stereo mono adapter good ear 
agreed  would never go back  standard 
vive longer jumped back couple hours past two days remembering heck bought first place  put order das  psyched 
agree  baffles s standard  also missnamed  deluxe strap audio  though guess doenst roll tongue  s better description think 
really like das  s amazingly comfortable  headphones really nice  downside mic   morning took headphones opted use headphones mic  wireless  may get external mic switch back  mic makes awesome coop games harder buddy  mean  money worth strap  honest 
longer use sennheisers  love das 
more love  nt even know thing watching youtube vr videos noticed guy different strap  come standard  makes vr way better 
exactly experience  well  wish bought 6 months ago 
make sure watch  tutorial video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vus6omgwt5rw   follow easy pie  make sure properly rotate old straps 
ca nt open box cereal without destroying  able watching video first  good 
installing recommend tighten screws  mindful scratch lens  side strap buckles attach hmd  cases users install das fall screws loose 
really easy switch     https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  timecontinue34  vus6omgwt5rw  great video showing  biggest difference old strap cables going vive logo opening compartment cover  new cables go cable opening 
fairly easy  follow instructions carefully 
like tpcast  s something m really interested 
yes helped  back section rigid hold front part better  able tighten much keep 
das  sits firmly head far less  tight  feeling  default strap needs much tighter nt fit well around back 
night day difference  would get noticeable discomfort playing 30 minutes original strap  das gets rid completely  using  highly recommend anyone regularly uses vive 
never got headaches  back das fits much better back head takes lot pressure front  maybe help 
d say s improvement   vive feels like whole new hmd  kind way   much better though  old strap started feel uncomfortable 30 minutes  less   play around 1 hour without serious discomfort das 
used ebay mine  think bestbuy well 
looks like shipment 2 days  probably still better sources
m sure  know mine came amazon  christmas  assume offering deal das purchase new vive s short supply 
got mine newegg 
microsoft store stock  ve bought vive related stuff far 
congrats   welcome vr  
actually  delayed audio strap     stock strap 
know vive builtin mic  right 
 longer use sennheisers  maybe different reasons  last christmas season active friend destroyed mishap flying  santa s sleigh richie s plank experience    m audiophile snob  wo nt give headphones    you silly rift owners touting meager builtin headphones    lot demoing vr  home  travelled   hassles putting phones   dropping   eventual damage   reluctantly ordering das  trying  m convert  apologies rifters teased  waste money including phones  comments  das std option ordering 
hah  sound like  m 
s great  ve read many issues recommendation works  recommend person research  understand components comes know re getting   video receiver head tethered belt battery pack  video transmitter top head level clear line sight times  battery pack transmitter belt  tpcast router wired service provider pc  https  imgurcoma1pfky
d also take play space consideration  got one recently definitely amazing  however find constrained larger play area
actually pulled trigger amazon  seems like get next week 
nt noticed delay  pay attention curse pointing  lol  stock sure 
feel way  like intended standard could nt get manufactured finished time first batch figured get make money hell 
ho  holy  crap  make world class idiot  m still incredibly happy hear  idea  shoot  work nothing  bet ll harder put back take  guess ll put back soon get home  tell  quality mic  s good  edit  ah  appears s good  ll stick might try find separate wireless mic decent  headphones sound really good really comfortable 
agreed 
s router  s replacing current router   part work  could simply use router already connection purposes larger reason use one give  already router 4 devices hardwired already  d prefer change setup much  ve tried searching  nt much explaining exactly setup works  also  ve seen ads whatnot release battery kept back vive headset instead attached belt  longer possible 
 mean strap delayed  audio   maybe nt get joke  hah 
 s workable good 
think works fine  better extra wires shit strapped head
nt want battery head  trust  rest questions  s outside area expertise  ve heard use router  nt gone 
oh  people picky thought something wrong delayed sound never noticed  nt joking thanks correcting 
 also missnamed  deluxe strap audio    people picky  pot  please allow introduce friend mr kettle 
htc  please sell deluxe audio straps without audio 
 d like increased comfort nt need headset  would instantly order cheap version without audio part 
included default strap cheaper order people nt already one  nt think bother selling without headphones  good quality headphones nt used since got das since comfort convenience built really ca nt beat  positional audio still works fine vr games nt great sound quality anyway nt feel m missing anything 
much default strap joke
headphones large driver current price though  removing would nt really change anything  thing came people asked oculus drop price rift omitting xbox controller  get things cheap bulk s worth effort create two different packing conveyor belts order create second version like  4 cheaper  could cut material cost eliminating earphones  d incurring new cost create new fork assembly line  better looking 3rd party solution  3rd parties selling foam facemask replacements  s reason one could nt create audioless deluxe headstrap 
sounds like welders mask mod exactly looking  buy cheap welding mask headstrap 2 supporting straps top head 1 back rotatable dial  get access 3d printer print    https  wwwthingiversecomthing2038745   nt access one use site printingshipping service  cost  20  offer  overall whole mod cost   45 comfort increased least x10 
ve asked quite time  sale das whole 
agreed  deluxe strap  minus audio  default sold every unit  period  optional audio components 
 ca nt use integrated audio das interferes hearing aids  stream pc audio bluetooth   demo d das windows store comfortable   100 comfortable 
builtin headphones huge part increased comfort  though  saying  put headphones time worst thing default strap   least 
experience  headphones pretty decent  s actual headphone jack hmd needs work  every pair headphones ve used sound grainy tinny 
support
nt one wholeheartedly agree frankly ca nt get sit flat ears
based sound quality  doubt builtin audio adds much price 
understand s really cheaper  remove speakers strap still use rest strap  re mounted single screw underneath velcro d padding little wire going around back padding   s super simple remove 
much  headset like noise cancellation etc  d much rather use das s headset 
option without would probably cost much raise price  supply lines absurdly complicated effort changing manufacturing process alone expensive sales
unfortunately  would nt make sense sell cheaper version without headphones  s going happen  want das  buy 
use audio almost much visual  playing multi player shooters  depend heavily audio experience tell players  das comparable good ear headphones people want high end experience  would definitely buy strap came without headphones
 got das since comfort convenience built really ca nt beat  audiophile going agree 
ca nt beat  overtheear provides immersion earphones ever  block outside noise op  also allows good mic instead awful vive mic  love manowars  earpads yuge  fits perfectly vive wireless  creates minimal fuss  https  d1urewwzb2qwiicloudfrontnetsysmasterrooth52hb58897375272990razermanowarwirelesspcgamingheadsetjpg
 nt think bother selling without headphones   like supreme pizzas nt think pizza place sell plain cheese ones   granted  headphones nice  moment get das look go  100 dollars  still use anyway  s fantastic  highly recommend  reason sell 100 bucks good competitor right  would 40 dollars 
saleprice drop would work  involve altering manufacture  right 
cool  going look  thanks tip
made welding mask mod using 3d print linked far bought das  far stiff nearly formfitting das  unless get different welding mask sort elastic fitting  really uncomfortable  das  adjust top strap easier different users  welding mask hard top strap readily adjustable especially since wrapped sock comfort guide cables 
looks great  check  thank 
disagree  optional  sure  works actually cost less  extra cost manufacturing  separately packing  storing variant might well offset savings  built headphones attached headset main point das  extra convenience deal separate headphones exists  s right name 
use hdmi audio reason usb audio sounds like trash  used sound fine point botched
remove 
every time use ota headphones slide chafe especially look slip backwardsup head  plus playing climbey much added weight neck looking hours workable  pair headphones use nt problem 
s  comparable   assume ve tried  k  ratio go 
would nt call audiophile connotations high quality stereo setup care audio quality  games good enough sound give crap  battlefield  name  none vr  das headphones good enough handle rudimentary positional audio highly compressed sound effects 
look like d make hotter actual ear muffs  thanks  vr pretty quiet room outside noise nt issue  except someone trying get attention  ear headphones person would physically touch shout  startling could lead someone getting elbow face 
 also allows good mic use good mic using das headphones
terrible analogy  ca nt easily pick disgusting mushrooms surpreme pizza  would take 30 seconds remove das headphones would nt require touching fungus  headphones probably add  2 manufacturing cost  obviously could cheaper without  s realistic expect niche accessory niche product split even smaller subaccessories  knowing htc  selling headphones separately would mean d sell strap  80 headphones  40 
headstrap made soft moldable plastic quite comfortable form fitting 
completely agree variant  often make business decisions balance variety added upkeep costs variants  main purpose  probably depends using using  personally would like  many others concerned primarily much comfortable das extended use consuming videos  movies sedentary media  least  would agree head strap version longer place consumer market
m using display port pc hdmi tv nt think switch hdmi audio 
would like sell without headphones cheaper price  pay  99 strap remove headphones nt sound like good deal   50 strap without headphones would buy immediately
interesting  never problem describe  makes sense  use pair wireless astro a50s  many others  cheap  never problems describe  never even considered problems could exist till read   also 51 surround nice mic  zero issues wireless signal cutting  unlike logitech headphones tried   dont notice added weight  wife  guess im used  first time using sort  head gear  tho  gamer 
use artic 7 headphones  super comfortable weight might still issue 
set hd518s pretty much perfect stay place without heavy 
buddy try albeit briefly  sound nt bad ear headphones huge step  k  go better headphones
dude m using garbage 
always benefit better headphones regardless quality source 
yeah much ditto  onear headphones come deluxe audio strap convenient  work fine still allow cool air around ears  headset alone already gets uncomfortably warm  especially physical games  adding overtheear headphones quickly becomes unbearable  especially az summer 
cold day hell  ever  buy  gaming headset   especially razer headset  decent gaming headsets ve seen ones sennheiser back day  nt know still  back one supposed top range gaming headsets giveaway ended literally throwing trash hour  also  71 surround scam  onear headphones come deluxe audio strap work perfectly fine combined added convenience keep noise sufficiently wo nt bothered unless live highway 
luckily  nt  mask always felt 10x hotter ears ever gotten  vivenchill fixed mask problem  s cool    lmfao  interesting  normally people around speak louder ll hear  takes shouting volume must deafening  especially quiet room  getting startled vr worries point ca nt wear overtheears without fear elbowing people  m speechless  guess s   
sure  want tape tie one equipment  point earth would nt using wifi headset anyways  unless nt care gear looks like  lol m reminded  welder s strap fix   https  cdnthingiversecomrendersbe869dcb71c7f63e5cc361a5f888e0b4bd8355deb6previewfeaturedjpg
difference pizza place knows people nt want mushrooms nt charge  pizza places keep line  htc knows many people buying strap alone adding mushrooms simply force people buy  one compete would lower price  headphones probably add 2 dollars manufacturing cost still charge 100 dollars instead 80 probably costs 1020 dollars total build thing  re lucky nt put microphone charge us 140 
got link 
s fair feel comfort improvement easily worth price alone
headphones use ps4  tried vive yet  perhaps  found a50s get uncomfortable long sessions  4h  pressure add ears head  definitely believe op issues  always chalked skull bit large side  trouble finding hats nt tight  instance     
yes nt outweigh convenience lack heat retention das headphones  past 5 years ve spent  700 iems headphones  seems like expensive  less durable    several thousand dollar stereo setup believe pretty good ear   quality das headphones minimum meets level quality sound produced vr games  nt agree want use  high quality  headphones ca nt afford  99 das  m sorry guess maybe ask santa one 
perfectly fine  bought athm50xs  headset  btw   want  high quality   perceptible difference quality last set headphones directly affects gameplay  example  headphones first enable hear exact position cloaked spy s footsteps tf2 pointblank oneshot shotgun  hunting bullets  point shoot  dead  already superior quality headphones  spend money set headphones nt want vive comfortable 
 tape tie  standalone mics nearly always kind clip  nt rig anything  d clip deluxe audio strap next round hmd attachment point  shirt  depending type mic  though lavaliere type probably recommended movement games 
use  one   https  smileamazoncomgpproductb00oa60rkirefohauidetailpageo03s00  ieutf8  psc1   need cut front piece touches forehead  run wire along top use velcro hold middle flying place pulling hmd  use 3d printed piece linked connect 2 sides  send pic setup want use reference 
mean  bought one came  really standard  especially rift audio comfortable strap packed  htc seriously needs price drops 
could afford  nt want  s worth much immersive experience using headphones  find fact headphones nt attached extremely minor inconvenience  listening mediocre headphones pretty big inconvenience personally 
pair athm50x also perfectly fine  pair headphones  s nothing spectacular  sure beat gaming headset headphonesheadsets partake 71 surround scam  use mine going outside though  re closed back pretty cheap  nt mind someone steals lose  agree would nice also sold das without onear headphones  meh  big deal  vive really coming standard das anyway  price vive way high compared oculus rift much love vive  longer recommend someone wants buy first hmd 
athm50x headphones well  still use das vive  convenience ca nt beat  sound certainly good enough 
every time ve seen someone say use standalone mic ve said taped  sorry  clip would help  s still 3 different products people talking convenience n  sounds little odd  throwing wifi headset vive hardly inconvenient anyways  takes effort select game  eh  guess everyone different setups  already standalone mic headset  etc  guess s easier stick 
bundling good step
ok  enjoy acne
 pair athm50x also perfectly fine  pair headphones   onear headphones come deluxe audio strap work perfectly fine  re saying  99 set headphones advanced head strap   129 pair headphones  might  suspect d hear differently 
mean shit use das hifiman he400i s purely convenient  das headphones nt bad means  plus people using vive s much easier take headset hand someone 
wut
 m saying athm50x totally fine pair headphones  touch overpriced get opinion  still totally acceptable good s job  s d go gon na use separate pair headphones  d say definitely come ahead audio strap headphones  mind blowing margin  entry level enthusiast headphone come ahead  m big fan v shaped soundstage m50s  s really convenience factor means  really wanted higher quality audio experience  d go effort hooking dt1990s dac  s worth personally  anyway  said like m50s gaming enjoy able hear exactly sound coming  would really recommend considering pair open backed headphones next upgrade  open backed headphones generally better closed back due sound fight reflections  air pressure etc inside headphone cup  unless game loud enviornment would always suggest open backed headphones personally 
 d say definitely come ahead audio strap headphones  mind blowing margin  great  headphones better ones das  need pay das headphones

think s way overpriced regular strap sucks  never great time starts fray get even worse  luckily ms coupon  100 vive purchase  d getting either way want best vr experience think s unfair base charge  100 bucks something s effing strap 
nt understand appeal honestly  adjusted straps perfectly first week got vive headset extremely comfortable  nt adjust multiple people  personally use open back sennheiser hd 598 s re extremely comfy fall tilt head back way  suppose headphones came vive  would nice upgrade 
m waiting reviews  m interested audio side tbh  would like stable headstrap one bit easier move players  wife kids often swap turns game 
right   already far better headphones included strap  nt enough issues current headstrap justify paying  100 new one 
depends quality headphones 
 deleted 
think ll find selling vive buying new system altogether like lg s hmd soon justify investing vive 
nice headset  standard headstrap really bare minimum  although wish audio optional deluxe  m grabbing s always pain switch people  also  oculus rift comfortable distributes weight evenly 
ill buy current headphones headstrap stop working  right 
yes  bought microsoft store preorder  eagerly awaiting  especially wife says headset rests much weight cheeks really make difference weight distribution comfort  m hoping  plus wireless audio solution minimal extra setup  plus 
never thought audio solution problem  number one issue wireless moment  would rather use  100 towards tp cast 
right jerry rigged mod using mix double sided velcroadhesive paper clips using headphones took apart headphones essentially part strap  s comfortable  problem gf smaller head  friends much bigger heads  immense pain try adjust headset current system  absolutely hated wearing high quality headphones mod  due slipping  extra wire slapping back  etc  m definitely leaning towards getting  ca nt wait bit see people say though  say current vive strapaudio solution good enough  people wanting better complainers  good working  however people like  simply makes playing games annoyingmore chore  turn inspires ever put headset 
s going interesting see lg headset going released  s released soon enough people might better selling vives getting lg one 
nah  nt need  current straps fit enormous head quite comfortably 
 mostly 1k hours using vive kids straps starting show wear hopefully kids tighten  currently son need put towel back head get decent fit

get amazon ll buy  headphones removable though 
already pre ordered  ca nt wait   
waiting reviews since pumpkin head  got ta make sure ll fit  glasses 
preordered mine recently amazon  think s essential accessory cause really nt like option adding extra headphone top head unit  plus reading watching reviews  s comfortable fit easier adjust like psvr  really like way head unit fits  also use laptop take vr friend s home  wo nt need lug around extra headphones  thing noticed people use vr  happened well  quick jerky head movements  headphones fallen heads  way  new ones  s built   
m definitely getting  public demos every month  resize straps continuously 
idea strap going included new headset purchases 
s outrageously expensive  around €150   normal strap feels really front heavy rarely feel like s sitting properly  active games wobbles around bit  nt feel secure  nt actually move significant amount  need readjust  
say  audio strap looks like terrible product  price get high end wireless gaming headphones  got set razor man war £90   huge battery life  71 surround  mic  totally rock 
definitly going buy  external headphones pain 
deluxe audio strap looks problem original strap  still quite uncomfortable  worth money  create similar system sony vr   buy revolve  looks promising  http  wwwsynergywizcomrevolve
 locked htc ecosystem  bullshit  nobody force buy additional piece hardware   nt change thing beside comfort  m glad htc give us options improve vr system  trackers must  everything else ist nice  highly likely buy headstrap  wireless depends reviews 
nope  waiting vive cv2 come mods including foveated rendering  lighter package higher density screen maybe bigger fov

get op wanting get locked htc vive ecosystem honestly going least year affordable competitor beats vive every single aspect  nt see lot early adopters extremely wealthy replacing v1 vives big jump resolution possibly built wireless 
 s annoying year release still ca nt get accesories anywhere else  postage insane 
alternate selling vive accessories shipping europewide  may alternative worth considering  german page lists almost accessories  uk one business vive audio strap right  shipping costs would £ 990  still better htc 
ordered microsoft  free shipping us  wondering handle biz uk 
headphones 
head strap really annoying re developer lot people play vive  fiddling velcro straps annoying  gets bunched re taking headset repeatedly test things  s also pain use normal headphones ll cable dangling around behind  shoulder  whatever  pair dt 770 pro headphones coiled cable  thing slap back time take experience  none deal breaker  headset streamlined bit comfortable welcome 
came ability flip whole front visor like night vision goggles  like aftermarket headstrap kickstarter  would lot interested  agree back uncomfortable part  discomfort back wire sometimes laying properly  m still going get though  headphones  m sick put remove headphones ears dangle m using speakers  might good idea wait see offers advantages wireless option comes  self restraint 
share vive 20 people  straps problem  solves ll drop money  plus people large heads  straps barely fit  plus built headset  good buy deal headphones people  using vive  would agree though 
got vive week ago velro one side already peeling away alittle bit  strap ca nt come fast enough 
get neck strain using vive due front heavyness
ve got long hair  current headstrap really uncomfortable pulls hair  hoping new strap solves issue  wo nt know receive 
 vive always comfortable ve never issues  people like complain lol
better ergonomics  lighter  builtin foveated rendering wireless capabilities  yeah  m keeping vive wait gen2 
fear  accept pulled trigger 
picked velcro sticky strips  cut fit extended velcro vive  works great kiddos  i m waiting see hear new strap fitting smaller heads 
kickstart enough get strap still need buy  latter  would definitely wait reviews first since original ones dont look promising
 considered deluxe audio strap  say s like oculus strap  oculus nt comfortable enough 
m bit worried wireless thing  feel like lots latency ruins immersion  also putting wireless receiver top head eventually fry brain 
yes 
apparently 
using headphones vive uncomfortable least  tend use earbuds lot comfortable vr experience
want better strap  audio 
s dream 
nt think  aftermarket one kickstarter 
mic vive nothing straps 
say people need bigger smaller shoes 
keep headset perched forehead like goggles  nt bother straps hold face m frequently taking  hifi headphones replaceable cables  huge selling point  since cable always first thing die   buy super small one  use foot long one ath m50 s  understand problem strap  good set ears much comfortable immersive crappy ones s worth mild cable slapping 
active games sports games move head back forth quickly elastic straps causes vive slide around  addition find constantly readjust long play sessions  s liking complain s wanting something better exactly promised dev kit vive pre days 
 people like complain lol complaining complainers better straight complaining  amirite  s
punch heαdphones eαrs every single song soundboxing  thαt s worthy complαint 
 except
yea using awhile switched towel  worst guess ill keep using towel new stap nt tighten enough
backed enough get one  later revisions look interesting look forward receiving mine soon  ujtworks apparently busy production 
looks different  thicker padding ratchet tightening system like welding mask mods 
s good seen handson preview  seems work fine without noticeable latency  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vzcwz8nafgs
audio headset good comes decent mic  audio ear muffs new deluxe headstrap upgrade standard buds asking mic upgraded also  sorry wrote tired read unclear  would still need use good mic ear muffs strap wont worth still need wireless turtle beaches
shoes display fully adjustable every way  look  m sorry wimp comment offended  common days   reality many people expect perfect hmd gen 1 nt bad people try complain 
bought short custom cable connect bose qc 25 vive  strap problems either  seems like 120€ nt need spend 
ve tried buying shorter cable 598s ca nt seem find one  ve settle using velcro cable wrap coil existing cable  s big deal though  certainly worth buying expensive audio headstrap continue using 598s free 
accept pulled trigger  alright 
 deleted

video showing replace current vive headstrap vive deluxe audio strap
s  video   https  youtubeus6omgwt5rw  showing replace current vive headset strap vive deluxe audio strap  video description  says able secure old new 3in1 cable clip side audio strap  clip look wide enough fit  fatter  cables original vives 
removal headphones please  although m sure s simple 
want know routes 31 cable along side instead top center head 
great video  saved whenever get hands deluxe strapon
really wish could buy without shitty ear headphones  original strap pretty bad dont want pay part ill remove 
better fit older ribbon style  like ribbon 
like deluxe audio strap  moves 3 1 away back headset  would always bother would lay head hmd watch bigscreen  fingers crossed cradle comfortable 
still got ta wait till june get one available 
still using pre s  wondering works 
microphone located 
nt really need headphones  like instrument separation sound stage htc earphones provide  ve actually replaced hd25 iis htc earphones dailies  crazy right  crazy comfortable 
still waiting buy little piece 3d printed plastic use welding mask mod 
nt see point though  pair nice headphones  like bose  better experience right 
removable  ll need small phillips screwdriver  spare screw  specs user guide  case lose 
yeah ll try  really like using earbuds 
think wrong sub re looking deluxe strapon 
put headphones huge pain ass  would easily take drop sound quality without deal something try adjust put everytime want put headset
know re shitty 
know saw somewhere said would  safe  sorry nt source 
nt know knob back feel put weight  might uncomfortable  damage 
re streamer media  looks like get  earlier   https  twittercomobriend17status862068033400918016    likely still early june like says video description 
exactly likely  far m aware vive pre identical consumer vive outside 
vive hmd  right abovein front nosemouth
assume kind extension lead right  cable vive buds ridiculously short  obvious reasons  
bulkier  hotter  hassle take demo 
bose qc 35  intensive games like onward holopoint tend want fly  games like fsxfly inside much hassle put  unless m truly wanting immersive experience  ve found playing speakers  okay enough  experience   sayin   see use builtin headphones  close enough  experiences 
roculusnsfw
dont mean sound quality mean theyre ear  im vr want immersed  hearing everything going outside game  ear itd fine 
re onear  s enough make shitty anyone ever used circumaural headphones 
doubt damage  probably wo nt comfortable 
june 6 👍
nt extra band clip   band goes directly around metal bar 
oh really   wonder mic using right headset mic well  audio plug cord even mic connection  time ve adjusting mic headset probably nt even coming 
correctamundo  need get lighter extension though  tugs ears 
onears deluxe audio strap lot fit settings  pop towards ear away give ears breathing room outside sound  adjust forward back also 
ve got bose qc35 tried vr  s comfortable press vive s strap closer head ears  confirm also get really hot feel bulky  cumbersome  re using bluetooth  delay moving head audio stream breaks occasion  recommend 
demo yes  hours onward maybe
one  please review  p
ye  makes sense 
vr porn shit  porn industry supposed driving force behind media consumption platforms 
nt really hear anything rift s open ear ones  live especially noisy environment  might dealbreaker  case  helps justify  majority cost strap probably headphones  ll similar  likely  rift s built ones  estimated cost  20 drivers  re paying r  htc put making strap ergonomic easy use 
prefer circumaural ones comfort reasons rather anything sound  every pair onears ve used made ears hurt pressure  ones nt issue personally m giving benefit doubt 
nt problem since pop entire piece
35mm cable output  
nt change audio settings steamvr still default one vive 
ll honest ve actually tried included buds vive  quickly dismissed  probably wo nt fit ears   probably cheap sound like shit   ve always used vsonic gr07 iems  want isolation  creative aurvana live  want awareness  demoinggroup play   might give shot tomorrow  saves loop extra cable around neck 
yeah  using headphones tribal instincts always uses  hurt top head  switched packin ear buds  much better 
ha   stopped using ear headphones reasons  use ear buds  way better  nt solve demo issue 
maybe re palate refined  expensive produce  small marketlots bland  safe choices 
nt find shit  really good content 
bothers end  nt design hmd support trrs connector 
yep  set headset thought meant set headset s audio plug  feel like dumb ass lol  vive came actual information instead poster cables box 
first 3 4 different size ear things included  gr07s  may notice vive earphones sound cheaper  nt think sound  cheap  though  sound little worse vive  use dedicated sound card desktop use 
ear buds bother inner ear plus sharing headphones fine  easy clean  demoing earbuds got ta keep spending money annoyance swapping gel tips
re wrong  takes special kind tn  interesting nowadays  help  fetishes ruined life 
oh nt mean fit tip size  ve got billions tips laying around house could easily find fit regard  meant angle actually go ear canal  htc ones straight  bullet style  ones  iirc

concern vive deluxe audio strap
hey guys  tried deluxe audio strap past week something wanted let guys know  writing early review strap encountered potential flaw connector headset  stress testing strap moving hands around heavily  everything fine  took headset one connectors actually fell  looked like  https  imgurcoma3qj0h re sure something happen others  know seen happen one guy  bumble   talking owners stress testing  nt seem problem  could fix finding screw driver fits mounting everything back  however bit scary  easy lose one tiny parts  happened bumble   wanted let guys know  re interested early review   watch   https  youtubelopmibhr4yu   want see happened us  skip 319 re still happy deluxe strap much convenient comfortable  hope wo nt fall tightened everything  s video bumble s situation re interested  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vuhulv68vige
wanted make sure shared prospective deluxe audio strap owners  please make sure follow inbox guide remove current standard strap vive correctly  quick illustration  http  imgurcomzurd70b also video tutorial  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vus6omgwt5rw
looked like bumble incorrectly removed original head strap  causing breakcome loose  yet use deluxe  reading proper techniques  looks like rotated connector vertically removing 
exact problem  took hours work fix  pin falls side inside headset threaded screw holds together  became loose detaching original strap could get new strap click  like side  manage fix  secure old strap nt intended 
im worried  watched bumble s video yesterday almost made thread figured isolated case  gals problem  least good know put back together provided dont lose parts  poor bumble  since im verge bying anyway  postpone purchase 23 months wait user impressions 
great review  definitely looking forward getting hands one 
nt problem vive deluxe audio strap per se  s problem torx screw cam assembly headset thread lock applied reversing  received repaired headset back htc screw loose one side headset  tighten back torx driver  screw falls  multiple pieces strap mount cam mechanism fall time  picture shows  would recommend everyone check tighten torx screw sides headset installing vive delux audio strap 
thanks calling make sure follow instructions removing old strap 
yes  tested talked  may new connection weaker  s holding headset new rigid side strap creates cantilever type force attachment point  old strap nt possible create  torque  bc strap nt rigid  basically nt hold sides  hold top 
tested s review pointed  big deal though
nothing little hot glue wo nt fix  lol
understand post 4 months old thought d add two cents  tried best get support customer service  end needed return product amazon nt want pay fee fix defective strap  m sending back amazon  seems wasteful noted  nt seem easy fix 
saved get mine case happens  thanks tip  
https  englishstackexchangecomquestions55672isitwhatitlookslikeorhowitlookslike
thanks video  followed instructions problems das  maybe important part properly disconnect old headstrap  nt need use force fully rotating old headstrap 
thanks  followed instructions  somehow old straps nt easy rotate clockwise click  unlock  use bit force get unlock  wonder made loose 
yes  old headstrap properly disconnect rotating connector makes click  big forces needed  nt  sounds like connector break 
 deleted 
could  chary manual vive s tutorial video stated  rotated connector vertically removing old strap  still happened  could still headset maybe something wrong connector  guess time tell  use bit force get old strap  also  rotate  connector cracks  apparently normal  others   feels like breaking headset  nt though  tightened everything btw play 
appears case user error  pried old strap instead following instructions proper removal  users followed instructions appear problem  see post shenye 
thanks  ll definitely enjoy much developer  handy able put top head 
good tip  definitely seems like tightening makes everything fine 
good stuff   hope help others get problem 
uchiablo pointed  tested video jank old headstrap done  s timestamp  https  youtubezgtnfohxgwg  t1m30s  130 timestamp nt work  pull connector like 
would mind posting picture mean holding top  tried video said  holding top trying rotate buckle  nt easy video made look though 
yeah saw review  hope wo nt big deal indeed  wanted share experience   
looking photo right side hmd  correct motion would anticlockwise 90 degree turn  anyone encountering issues get deluxe audio strap  please let know  photos details appreciated 
re right  s timestamp  https  youtubezgtnfohxgwg  t1m30s  130 nt work  s definitely 
tried following instructions exactly video manual  nt easy looks us 
would  unfortunately m work right  really mean hold top  middle  strap transporting headset around instead grabbing either side straps  connection top velcro instead mechanical  s chance breaking holding 
m concerned top back spin tighten strap  bradley said felt really loose demo stands conventions  m worried happen year normal use  strap becomes loose able hold hmd 
nt  mean  detach hold hmd sides  right  may happen spin head fast 
ah yes  look photo s anti clockwise  exactly said 
ujerware something might snapped loose inside  ubradllez also complained hard snap review  showed directly snapping instead snapping 90 degrees rotation  sure manual actually tells way though 
ah  though meant  okay thanks letting us know 
problem caused adjusting knob  d probably ok re user  re swapping someone else daily basis  d concerned   still  price  able handle trade shows month wear  s bad sign 
nt concern really  provided connected properly  difference new old strap terms connector strength  seems like could accidental breakage  failure reconnect strap sides vive  alternatively  hope m wrong   new strap connector different old one minor way causing  seems unlikely though  would come design files hardware stock 
actual instructions booklet doesnt tell take old headstrap  tells go online details  illustration putting shows rotation  seen  http  iimgurcomnhtfqsvjpg
thanks heads thread  thankfully nothing snapped loose  reconnected original headstrap held firmly ever  deluxe audio clamps simply little looser mine  problem  ve played 6 hours bridge crew issues  way  find notches re supposed use remove headstrap review  others mentioned  instructions come deluxe audio strap nt specify remove old strap 
instruction manual specify angle connect new headstrap hmd nt think relevant  http  imgurcom8utnxcr feels strange squeezing hmd palms xd edit  also tried pick side straps nt disconnect  d still recommend pick top strap  grabbing sides letting dangle feels strange due hmd s weight distribution 
act replacement could problem  snap connection critical spot  800 device  screw 5 
normal strap think slots 90 degrees really easily turn click place  instead forcing directly 
ya critical connection points made metal instead snap plastic  seems like major design flaw imo  time take connect new headstrap  nt easy take 
1  metal heavy 2  metal plastic connections complicated plastic plastic connections 3  plastic sufficiently strong task  overengineering nt add value  tl  dr nt need
may also waiting see first batch plays make adjustments  much like first wave hmds  deluxe audio straps seem completely unavailable right 
re available right nt supposed released june 6th retailers shipped early 
every product always development 
people getting audio strap today  official installation video instructions
""
make note instructions rotate strap fully pulling remove  think s partially people breaking connector guy saw youtube pulled without rotating  later saying broke 
thank goodness made official video  showing attach properly break like reviewers  lol
additional step video highly recommended people  s included instruction manual understand   use provided velcro cable tie attach 3in1 cable back strap cable hangs middle back rather right shoulder 
placed orders saw  official video  order completed page  swear copied link drop rvive  good job  fellow hive minder
cool  video come handy two month time htc actually deliver 
thank  really helped install  😎
tribal instincts updated review  https  youtuber2xdhjn64bi
seems fully stock everywhere uk  
says   usually ships within 1 3 weeks  
option without headphones  looks like really nice headstrap thing d rather spend  100 
need new 3 1 cable  still original one
 20 shipping  jesus 
assume original 3 1 cable wo nt work well right 
watched video definitely rotated one connector  secondary one visible 
agreed  also careful lady says rotate clockwise  really s one clockwise one counterclockwise  strap going main point 
thought thing  got delxue strap today ca nt even install  rotating left one  clicks comes fine  rotating right one  click  get strap right side headset without snapping  nt tried yet  people breaking connectors 
  nt see post installed mine  one connectors came instructed  nt broke whole assembly  thankfully matter reinstalling parts together holy fuck annoying 
vr round table guy actually recommend using velcro  ymmv  https  youtubea4akdvm2um4
one guy youtube used velcro different spot  like    http  iimgurcomg9ol1wypng   looked like could work well
uh oh  s actually pretty damn big deal right 
doubt knows
nope  old 3 1 cable works perfectly
 free shipping microsoft amazon states least 
work well either old new 3 1s  plenty people demonstrating  clip clearly designed old cable mind actually 
works  original cable s fine deluxe audio strap
 right 
toughest part taking straps sides  scared going break shit 
issue  one side slid give gentle force clicked harder  checked connector damage seems solid still  probably issue people 
59 min video 
curious  others ve seen say makes better  suppose worth trying ways m pretty sure d much prefer wire middle back rather right shoulder 
might  looks like tribal picture 
thanks 
goddammit  ordered htc  m states 
start video  old cable  end  reattach new one 
spin middle side topwise 
ve seen strap going  perhaps works well nt personally seen people  d go safe bet 
took force originally wanted apply trying connect new strap  oh well  well ends well  
lol  randomly clicked random part video talks around 1830 basically says cumbersome hanging middle back deluxe strap  says old cable pulls velco strap wrong better let hang right side clip  stuff talk pure fluff dont need watch 
check description video see segment discuss audio strap 
yes 
still time cancel  much easier return either amazon andor microsoft nt care imho 
funny  nt even notice  ve got plenty videos last days people using old cable new strap 
thank finding nt time watch try find part even looked description  fwiw  m sure agree guy video  granted couple hours new headstrap thought cable  using old cable  much less noticeable original headstrap nt feel awkward  fact one things immediately noticed liked  seems like hanging right side shoulder would feel worse give shot ve time default  way  m sure  others  said old cable nt fit well new headstrap  fits fine  bottom line recommend trying ways making final decision 
looks like s sold everywhere else  guess ll take chances htc  thanks suggestion though    
available preorder amazon ca prime release june 9  yay
htc ’ deluxe audio strap better headphone solution vive
""
pretty excited  ve always kinda felt like vives strap one areas seamed every hmd better option  tpcast awesome  excited drop another  350  400 expensive toy  oh well 
like earbuds  hopefully option purchase improved strap without buy earphones 
htc choosing word deluxe  name making nervous much re going charge thing  ll buy s unreasonable though  hard make current strap secure without uncomfortably tight  use portapro headphone mod already  earbuds nt fit properly take experience often 
almost makes regret headgear mod  probably still cheaper diy 
title verge story sucks  s way  better headphone solution   clearly see picture adjustment works similarly psvr  pull head tighten back knob  however also evolutionary psvr solution  since seems way sturdier stable psvr s forehead balancing  psvr s solution good seated experiences fast movements reach floor without flying head 
really nt want drop  100 increases comfort ll

really hope version without headphones  something least liked rift  actually like wearing ear headphones like sennheisers play  even shortened wire would never get thw way 
one simply care  find original strap perfectly fine prefer using headearphones shut ambient sound  hearing whine fans computer neighbors talking walls mess immersion whole lot 
picture ve released strap attached hmd  saw  polygon   http  wwwpolygoncomvirtualreality20171414170560htcvivedeluxeaudiostrap    headphone connector appears trrs type  wonder means mic  anyone tried connecting headset mic trrs connector vive  work 
pretty interested  hopefully  better balanced head support  nt particularly well suited headphones yet  cheap headgear mod  makes vive easier quicker put take  possibly got slightly uncomfortable m completely honest 
great news  wo nt getting current vive assume hope included default next gen vive 
meh  closed cup headphones ftw  default earbuds keep falling turn around quick 
d rather deal slight inconvenience using headphones  plus  issues current strap comfort  neat  meh 
 every hmd mean rift  psvr nt builtin audio either 
use headphones 10cm cable  otherwise  ve never liked onear headphones 
well still cable going headset audio feeling unplug remove earphones like rift
m boat  great options  prefer earbuds oculuslike solution
 right ’ accessory may leave way force anyone use audio  quote bit worrying  seems suggest headphones nt optional   uploadvr   http  uploadvrcomhtcviveaudioheadstraprift 
said beginning wanted vive premium headset  price headset showed imagine costa around  150 
welding mask mod cost  10 total since 3d printer whereas certainly  100 realm
agree  although psvr s mounting system elegant far always felt like might slip head move suddenly  whole thing also felt cheap m honest  saying kinda would nt mind vive lite basic functionality standard vive cheaply made  ca nt help feel new strap system step wrong direction far mass market appeal concerned  built sound nice  want lighter  elegant headset strap system unnecessary corners cut  aiming  500 included  priority  suppose working tide  hopefully 
comfort  headphones definitely worth  100
nope  ve adjusted standard straps properly fit good  ear cans use fantastic  issue length headphone cords swinging gameplay

nt mention audio  talking head strap 
remove oculus headphones 
 nt built  optional  
nt worried  like says currently re optional seem understand nt force use  also look promo pictures shows re magnetically attached allow easy disconnecting similar rift 
m guessing closer  100  could  still probably buy works better 
 headgear   https  wwwamazoncomgpproductb00826am7arefohauidetailpageo03s00  ieutf8  psc1  alone  22  3d print well 
think expensive  honestly ca nt see going higher  50
entirely understand coming  hoping lower priced version boost marketshare adaptation  true vr   roomscale   still enthusiast glad tpcast superior headband  nt think vive concumer friendly long time   good vr  requires expensive pc  therefore wish vive continue  deluxe vr  platform 
like current headphones  bought hd598s vive  although re great games music   nt give trouble 
tuck  headphone cable slack back shirt 
yeah wondered  sure d extra ring plug otherwise  maybe better quality one  ve seen fair amount complaints mic 
ow apologies 
yep  exactly talking 
m wondering  headphones  focusing vr  ossic headphones instance  would hope htc understands need forcing people use   headphones 
s s odd quote  seems talking whole strap suggesting replacing stock strap new one future vives would force people use audio  would nt case easily removable  also seeing promo pics show magnetic connection  far see nt really show connection  could bolted  still  hope re right 
even re detachable new strap  would nt want pay feature wo nt use 
used £4 one ebay  bracket still compatible upgraded purposebuilt one  mask mod s lightweight achieve sewn loops elastic routing cables back 
market willing pay around £600700 headset  plus 700 suitable pc £2030 go alpha stage games tech demos  earth would charge reasonable price accessories 
headphones alone would probably put 50 bucks  d say minimum  75
look htc charge accessories  consider set headphones integrated look charge  decent  earbuds  honestly  100 conservative 
yeah nt discontinue deluxe stuff m sure would rather get mass market fast possible  s arms race sorts  m sure needing expensive pc though  mine fine would cost around £500 make d imagine  foveated rendering make minimim spec lot lower still 
s  awful   also somehow includes better microphone  m even interested 
worries  inclusion audio kinda cool though  wonder releases future vive s come back  800 point

lighthouses controllers around  100  think disk straps  50  60
guess s subjective imho s great  hear everyone really well onward 
clear  seen strap person seen heard elsewhere s magnetic  m seeing anything picture proves   could   connection methods could give look 
lighthouse £122 controller £117 touted  deluxe  offering really really doubt cheap
really care audio really suck  nt really care s bad  fact though mic headset high quality one comes better one hope s higher quality

ca nt get spatial audio psvr youtube
anyone seen 360 video spatial audio tracking headset  videos youtube say spatial audio  sound like recorded ambisonics turn head 180 headset sounds nt move around  watch video chrome browser 
also interested  audio engineer  ambisonics spatial audio main reason bought psvr  let watched first vr mix youtube  hours hours work spent ambisonics nt translate play back youtube 
well least m crazy people issue  still seems like one addressing  even googling hard find info  video gets attention audio thought later  hopefully youtube patch fix  think people aware content developers  m current working 360 videos pbs  audio engineer amazing job mixing ambisonic tracks pro tools track head  huge bummer hard work nt show headset screened later 
worked vr piece natgeo audio spec sheet called quad mix  common delivery spec first order ambisonics mix  youtube video playing back first two channels  bummer way foa mixes supposed get decoded  first channel usually decoded static channel  vomusic everything supposed immune head tracking spatial audio goes  youtube decoding first two channels delivery normal stereo mix  sounds like everything coming left channel  extremely distracting  ruins experience people  mixing room proper decoding  sounds right  completely immersive  also made delivery hulu spec  yet see video show hulu  would like see head tracking patched correctly 
issues audio department running  seems like wait youtubes psvr app bring support videos quad track right  browsers html 5 seem decode correctly  successful head tracking video players  thanks info helpful 
nt luck testing spatial audio format psvr  mentioned head track html 5 browsers  workaround preview content psvr using 
surround sound headphones psvr s 3d audio

ps4 ’ firmware 500 adds 51ch  71ch virtual surround sound psvr cinematic mode
""
m sad nt vr features 
wonder anything address drift cinematic mode  sony nt seem want formally recognize issue exist degree 
know says br dvd m hoping applications like plex netflix also get virtual surround sound well 
s nice addition 
supposed release today
let us get rid whats new tab hide stuff nt use nt folder called ignore
useless feature hole setup goes avr  fix drift sony    
actually listened users d fix features launched first adding  like many  ve patiently waiting next big firmware update  confident surely working tracking drift fixes  upsetting 
anyone got spare code could send  valkyrie squad coded loving improved ping  thanks
pointless addition seen majority psvr user s dreaded drift making anything cinema mode chore watch 
quite useless feature  please put curve screen feature cinematic mode next firmware update sony   
still saving settings eye eye distance  least let type number 
someone beta confirm works gold headphones dongle  wired hmd   would also like know fixed avr pass  currently setup hdmi avr tv  watch 3d movie  tv nt 3d  nt get surround sound movie starts 
kind hoping family bit would finally allow game sharing family members  know s way around  nt really want 
info  connectiongate  fix  come  fix since launch october last year  joke 
anyone recommend decent inexpensive 71 headphones  also  bring psvr 20 4k lenses  love watching blu rays psvr  especially 3d films  heres hoping ps5 4k blu ray disc player 
got spare eu beta code anyone wants edit  sorry gone
better make patch fix drifting cinematic mode  inb4 saying check surrounding environment  whereas cinematic mode nt use camera track lol pointless update
 m sad  s picturegif cat    http  randomcati4lfrajpg  hopefully ll cheer     bot  use  unsubscribetosadcat ignore 
using  small  screen size seems rectify issue kinda lame 
exactly  nice addition  bad watching blurays vr unusable constant drifting blackouts  hdcp  
s nothing  cinematic mode cant use camera calibrate psvr s sensors  thing  done  provide recenter button 
 deleted 
 deleted 
d hope everything gets virtual surround sound  media games  astro mixamp basically something like  psvr s processing unit capable 
beta 
got beta invite  uk 
ll busy getting released  doubt time release anything 
andddd  static home screen  scroll vr folder quickly muscle memory 
way tracking cinematic view works currently  fixed  still nt know chose use gyro camera tracking  gyro always drift  even tracking 2 lights could tether enough longer drift 
indeed  o7
much  chore  recenter screen holding options button every often  minor inconvenience doesnt ruin experience 
 deleted 
might included bugfix rather feature  ll wait see guess 
s useless feature  s wanted  current audio setup cinematic mode dumb audio comes front  screen   changing instead simulating speakers screen  like 5171 speaker setup around room  s much needed improvement 
 littlstar  feature  
curved screen useful feature
’   new ps4 
 joke  mean joking  joke  nt know talking  would like know  connectiongate  something worry 
71 headset  vss works every pair stereo headsets

bot makes sad

think gyros turned using small screen size  tracking image moves turn head  pretty sure s small zero drift 
also limit cable length hdmi recommended maximums  anything longer risk signal degradation desync 
swapping sony cables nt blackout issues anymore hdcp turned  spare hdmi cable lying around d suggest swapping cable going ps4 breakout box least seeing makes difference 
 could enable camera tracking cinema mode
wonder ve tried solution using camera help manage drift  probably would nt perfect might also better current performance  another might would intermediate screen size small medium fills view fixed without head tracking  could good compromise well 
m pretty sure camera nt used cinematic mode lights issue  experience s gyros headset ultrasensitive even slightest head movements  sit straight drift prevalent m recenter pressing options button every minutes  lie use couple pillows cradle head keep rigid  drift almost nonexistent  unfortunately nt particularly comfortable way wearing headset 
d much rather 3d audio like dolby atmos overwatch every application simulate every direction including 
impossible games  works dedicated psvr app use additional ps4 ressources  update brings 5171 bddvd playback already happens within software psvr shell  gaming done native cinematic mode additional ressources available psvr features 
think s minor inconvenience cases people recentering literally every min 
nt issue cinema mode lights turned  hence poor tracking relies gyros 
ll using different tracking method  ll totally feature  normally  uses gyro  using camera tracking would get rid drift 
yeah s big indeed
indeed  particularly annoying watching movies audio

really disappointed third party developer come dedicated psvr media app play videos blurays  think s area ripe potential profit somebody made quality piece software 
 know play 3d 360 180sbs littlestar  really want curve option normal games 
weird  manual says supports stereo
mean re equal distance every surface screen  enhancing immersion 
sometimes re playing vr game  get one  two even five seconds blackout headset  black screen  sound fades back normal  know  minor thing bother  vr really frustrating s randomly black screen sudden  sometimes s okey image back sometimes causes hdmi handshake problem  flickering image tv results audio dropping earphones  screen headset ok must restart game  end session  everything fine  want play game next day thing  happen every time re starting psvr  beginning  people thought happening ps4 pro  nope  happen og ps4  ps4 slim pro  m issue slim  excuse poor english  see  https  communityplaystationcomcontentpdcusenuspdccommunitiessupportplaystationvrtopichtmlconnectiongateplays4clxhtml  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vsabyurdzpv8
 s joke sony  excuse  s clearly problem processor unit s causing infamous  connectiongate  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vsabyurdzpv8  people thought specific ps4 pro ps4 slim  okey  say  minor one two seconds blackouts per session something terrible  believe  ruin experience re buying expensive hardware  expect work like  problem known since october last year  check reddit official ps forums  since  s fix even word sony  people said  ok  live  ca nt  s definitely flaw fixed since ruin experience 
email took sony website gave 3 codes
 removed 
makes sense
would want able turn gyros medium large 
since hdmi signal completely digital  either work ask work  nt seen result  especially specifically testing hdmi maximum length signal goes flawless black one two white spots whenever maximum exceeded  s beauty hdmi need monster cables questions crap either hdmi gives signal nt
ok  ll try  thanks  cables hdmi 14  20  look 
ca nt  camera tracking takes good chunk system resources  resources needed system applications designed vr mind  therefore use resources 
right  lights cinematic mode 
 impossible games  nt  processing unit already positional sound  s one s main functions   s absolutely zero reason audio could nt extracted utilise pu s positional audio ability place 5171 channels 3d space  pu already stereo 
every 20 sec   nt care cinematic mode though  giant tv real life anyway 
literally every minute  think dont understand use term  literally  
 deleted 
 really disappointed third party developer come dedicated psvr media app play videos blurays probably  licensing   littlstar support ac3 dts come think  ps4 media player support dts either think ps4 bluray player support dtsac3 etc licenses add cost   
play pc  deovr steamvr using psvr 
well thanks explanation  ’ happen even  thankfully 
interesting ll relook  thanks 
good goodbot

s exactly problem op  intermittent signal loss  anecdotal ve never seen  true  s reason hdmi nt certify cables longer 25ft 4k hdr  422 10bit   signal degradation 
m pretty sure s hdmi 14 cable holdover got 3d tv 
yes  camera cinematic mode outputs regular signal psvr breakout box  ps4 nt anything else  order cinemaic mode compatible existing ps4 apps games  camera tracking  curved screen  virtual cinema  would need dedicated app  never happen games  however  already one video  3d bluray playback happens dedicated app outside cinematic mode    reduce drift  already reducing  far aware  
intensive could play video file
cut masturbation 
licensing issue good point  think sony still gets cut anything bluray playback m sure applies apps well 
s great   let stay way  
4677th user calling ugoodbotbadbot good bot  definitely awesome 
ok ll see  interesting people issue nt  s true  m still using bundled cables  remember changing cable breakout box tv still issue  box console  ll try 
right  m explaining could nt make enhanced cinematic mode camera tracking apps games 
well  video playback processing use significant gpu resources  however  applications unrestricted access resources  meaning unless sony updates specific apps ensure nt using specific resources camera tracking would require  ca nt simply enable like 
good bot 
ve read experienced  blackout problems often traced back either cable ps4 vr box  extension cable vr box headset  former nt work  could also try sony send replacement extension cable unit still warranty  hope works 
well upbto sony guess
could add camera tracking video player app  cinematic mode general 
good point  funny thing blackouts totally random  example  monday  turning vr end  everything perfect  single blackout  played 3 hours  tuesday  started robinson  journey  10 minutes game 1 second blackout headset tv  know  1 second still   perfect end  wednesday  single blackout whole session  sometimes m playing weeks without blackouts sometimes s happening every time  hdcp course  turn  blackouts every 1015 minutes  ve noticed one thing  blackout occurs  picture tv goes completely glitchy audio earphones dropping every minute  close game launch  s fine  looks like hdmi handshake problem  losing signal bring back glitches  nt know  ll try cables doubt s headset even extension cable problem  many people issue  something tells problem processor unit   ll try cables   nt understand devs even reviewers nt mention issue anywhere  reddit ps forum  s plenty people complaining  even asked  without parole reviews   s fix   re reviews pretty much every game ps store m curious  m still waiting response  
right  felt popular enough warrant extra development 
definitely  meant d avoid resources issue

exact problem hp headset  anyone found fix 
luck  get odyssey  s 2 minutes  s less random  15 ft usb extension nt tried removing yet 
issue lenovo headset  impression headphones jack really loose  apparently happens randomly  hope ms aware issue

may inadvertently stumbled fix  getting crash one games restarted computer headset plugged received static interruptions whatsoever got back game  let know works anyone else  pita restart every time want play vr beats getting ears blasted static 
still luck end  disconnect reconnect headphones  headset jack  temporarily fix issue  sometimes work 5 minutes  times hour  able pinpoint root cause  tried extension cables like yet either  probably options explore future  figure anything  please let know 
ugh  bummer  thanks sharing 
seems usb extension cable related experience  take usb extenstion everything works great  added  10 foot usb 30 cable  gets fuzzy couple minutes

apple eke current hardware platforms absolutely long consumers keep buying  possibly good time  competition forces otherwise 
hmmm  see re coming nothing pressured apple adding 3d touch phones  said 2 camera lens system  keep buying companies technology fits line mixed reality future  iphone biggest pot steady profit  beats products  means prepared consumers start buying glasses  apple ca nt let ml convert large amount iphone users buy magic leap glasses  means apple try get product using mr near future  even demand met 
well hope  competition good everybody  nt want buy apple ecosystem though  kind hope re first release truly compelling ar product
