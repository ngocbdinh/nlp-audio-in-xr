anyone else get easily startled vr reduced fov spatial audio 
played two games oculus rift made wonder get easily startled others experiencing  first one death  shooting monsters  knights archers teleporting castle interiors  soon realised enemies seen lose sight teleport somewhere near started feel like order aware surroundings pretty much quickly look around constantly  even battle  mean looking around much  could nt hear need rotate lot see narrow fov  thought s fine maybe game meant horrorlike experience nt enjoy stress  second game played wizards  nothing horror related  cast spells monsters coming  stage focus destroying object middle place big ogres constantly coming several corners around area got problem death  felt purely technical  footsteps virtual self rather loud kept changing location felt like someone right next various directions  constantly shifting  realised m even hearing footsteps giant ogres stomping towards  frequently frantically look around see appeared somewhere reached already  sometimes  probably passing spawn point  moment d turn around see giant ogre swinging cues beforehand  always startles  think case wizards could greatly improved developing game  since happened two games already curious hear experiences others  edit  fov and spatial audio title 
nt know s current state  closed beta death audial discrimination enemies floors  sounded like re around next corner whereas reach  audio aspects way harder evaluate games huge often underestimated impact  imho s way important set focus spatial audio fov future vr  s demanding hardware wise  sadly way harder communicate consumers improved   
find enemy sound  game developer use good 3d sound package simulate sound coming enemy  spatial audio technology game used  low quality headphone might decrease 3d sound feeling  though important factor 
curious see experience vr games compare pimax 8k arrives since 200 degrees fov compared vive 110 degrees fov many vr games make jump
give paranormal activity try want spooked  stood foyer house like half hour afraid look around corner hallway 
wow  totally agree  although s difficult  m happy s vr hardware 
m fine games intended  m taking game  rpg action game make jump reduced fov enough sounds around 
ah  see mean  screamed raptor came bushes island 359 first time skeever jumped  
interest ama spatial audio company 
hey everyone  gauging interest ama rest company  interested understanding s mind relation company self promotion  background engineeringai math  company called hear360 m happy discuss spatial audio anything re interested regarding vr large  thanks 
mean  d love hear  work visual side vr hearing audio would awesome  subreddit might crazy though

upload telemetry time  noticed 
understand psvr tracking works stereo camera pointed right  right  s whoosh 
know love tech  honestly think need control alt delete society  s become complicated lawyered mess  media everyone hating 
would quicker facebookoculus say  collect data 
mean clearly says  device settings choose  
 vive camera microphone exposed system standard apis  meaning visible system large could used snoop malwareadware system directly aware  aware  steamvr  could potentially include  websites    yes  s possible  website  open microphone webcam  though sane browser ask want allow first  exactly like regular webcam microphone  means also full control  s exactly want   furthermore  vive hmd never actually turns  steamvr nt running  s  screenoff  mode unlike monitor s sleep mode  nondisplay systems still fully operational  even steamvr nt launched since plugged  vive pro physical switch link box  also  think re totally wrong  tried capture mic camera data plugged vive s camera mic available app  could nt  shows device manager audio devices  s way actually use  wo nt capture tell  s black camera s audio coming microphone   imagine wmr headsets similar caveats  nt  re totally different systems  windows mr headsets probably safer  since ca nt access cameras   choice hardware nt make safe  best facebook software installed   block microphonewebcam access facebook site  meaning voice video calling services well   nope  s sure hell better standard web cam mic hardware pointing away full control rather black box proprietary software three cameras pointed 
precisely vive uses open apis  100  secure crappy proprietary shit software facebook creates  audit pretty much whole vivesteamvr softwarehardware  good luck facebook rift 
dont leave vive plugged  nt need camera  mic  use  reason one seems post tos privacy agreement letting htc whoever full access data camera mic  maybe s  maybe s  facebook shown everyone trustworthy  trust facebook s right accept  https  wwwoculuscomlegalprivacypolicy  information automatically collected use services  also collect information automatically connected services  depending access use services  collect information    information receive device settings choose  photos audio content  shamelessly lifted from ugodelbrot  nbsp  year ago https  wwwroadtovrcomoculusvrprivacypolicyservesneedsfacebooknotusers since facebook exactly hit news much showing much trusted 
thankfully us vr enthusiasts reclusive bunch  go outside anymore ’ got vr 
dunno  ’ got pihole set ’ entirely sure ad anymore 
ah yes  old patronizing patronizing argument  people calling benevolent organization patronizing   
still feels like bit stretch  whatever 
yeah s like saying google news android news  s vaguely related re still two different teams products
would  never  buy hardware m able deactivate remove software  sounds ridiculous  yeah  get thing right  thing works  people still buy  stop stop thing  vote wallet   ask someone install custom rom  also good option  
lol know exactly posted
well certainly nonsequitur 
nt get one phones 
haha good point 
everyone restraint underwear front computer 
probably 
nt trust people insane wealth help us   s rich stupid 
sounds like defective psvr camera set wrong  tracking fine admittedly best since camera view limited 
know  really sux  matter go s decently huge compromise  went vive hoping vive nt break  fb dealkiller fallout psvr ever expect game finally justified vr 
facebook take whole new level  hope companies get attention  facebook deserve bad press 
huge difference bytes gigabytes bytes camera data gigabytes could camera data simply way suddenly enable uploading video data sensors without noticed immediately  know  facebook may morally questionable stupid fact  fact people noticed something small bytes telemetry supports argument  nt disprove
people would understand possibly like  put  collect data  10 pages lawyerspeak guarantee nobody ever read much less understand 
means blanket allowances  like first try use camera app  ask permission saying yes app access camera hardware  essentially means legally allowed whatever want camera hardware long blanket clause like    information receive device settings choose  photos audio content  guarantee clause went workshopping whole piece  s probably identical ones use across apps imagine 
lenovo superfish  lenovo wmr headset  hmmm  nt seem like end well  since also topic hacking devices  know smart speakers amazon echo  google home  even apple smart speaker hacked use sonarlike method generate 3d map surrounding area  oh  data collection  also know three aforementioned companies collect data users almost exact ways facebook  google still picks information emails services may use  apple history  microsoft  amazon  pretty much major company  isp tracks online data  although actually using bit gray area atm legally  comcastxfinity actually injects code users browsers plans go allowed  mean like black mirror level ads   waiting legal green light  whole argument google  facebook  apple  microsoft  amazon  etc   nt   every big company collects data users  lot people nt realize  pr speak careful wording user agreements  vast majority people nt read    read      facebook posterboy issue  way go grid  convince politicians actually something  ca nt jump another ship s happening every ship 
vive camera standard uvc camera microphone bog standard usb audio interface  https  iimgurcomag0g7kppng nt tried vive pro yet know fact cameras accessed directly  also nt know windows  maybe really weird drivers make available special methods steamvr   windows mr headsets probably safer  since ca nt access cameras  nt actually looked code iirc s special uvc variant  https  githubcomph5ouvrtblobmastersrchololenscamerac  rather black box proprietary software three cameras pointed  like windows 
ugh  open api s  openvr open access  closed source buddy  open name nt mean  exact ability audit oculus  stack way steamvr

always wondered nt edit host file pc load onto router using one

s defective  shape tv fit sitting couch m way smaller frame picture  told rpsvr m exceeding allowed distance 
’ vive 2 years  replace one controller  fault damn gorn   still prefer experience oculus headsets  also ’ think support bad  wait 3 days response 
like keywords activate mic conditions camera would snap small picture 
s known buffer data send reasonable sized packets 
s part  lawyer speak also cover reasonable assumption   collect data  could reasonably assumed mean  collect data knowingly provide us  thus cover things like surreptitiously turning device recording 
thought talking oculus rift  nt camera camera app  read data coming tofrom sensors  data sent received  fb might oculus terms separate facebook s  power data desktop os

guys  asking real question  speakers  2htc vive  htcvive  nvidia high definition audio 
seems volume difference least 
according  valve   https  supportsteampoweredcomkbarticlephp  ref8566sdzc9326  audioissues    note  sending audio via usb may add extra latency sound playback  recommending using htcvive0 hdmi audio device highest quality audio 
’ read reddit threads people using speakers  2htc vive  cause tracking problems 
disable usb audio device whatever reason  also use speakers headphones computer primary device mirror htc hdmi audio  works fine 
thought  longest time used usb audio  nonnvidia one   time hdmi audio usb audio sound identical  might nvidia driver thing steamvr beta magic 
audio quality seems significantly better usb compared hdmi   though type  realize always skip nvidia audio driver installation driver updates 
dont use 2htc cause audio problems teamspeak audio sources 
prefer using hdmi audio  sometimes device nt available selection  nt able figure pattern yet  sometimes shows fiddle around advanced settings audio tab  like switch primary mirror items something else  hdmi audio show 
two cents  ve problems ways  interestingly enough  sometimes depends game  ve still never gotten arizona sunshine work hdmi audio  works fine places  one solution ve found  use set bluetooth headphonesspeakers output  ve never problems compatibility  sound working  latency  etc  highly recommend trying 
use wireless logitech headphones  shits glorious  m hoping get bluetooth card future use ultra lightweight sony bluetooth phone earbuds

need set sample rate hdmi device 48000hz  anything else sound like shit
seems reason enough stay away unless anyone else something say maybe happens 
issue  every get resolved  quickest way fixing issue either tinfoil sound sound either run  windows troubleshoot sound  speaker icon bottom right right click changing device pointed via left click speaker icon bottom right  latter seems work fine headset click  desktop  globe button menu  wonder problem originated fact previously used htc vive workstation prior using vive pro computer  case  htc vive installed configured using vive pro

  thank
ah  yes 
usb audio needs 44100 hdmi 48000
using displayport vive pro  could part issue 
options  ’ even appear   https  iimgurcomr3vj86fhjpg   entirely sure   
problem hdmi connection nt always show reason  also times seems huge lags sound using 
using display port nvidia setup hdmi audio well still  said s intermittent show wont 
wtf got htc vive usb audio nt  probably one mine renamed cause mobo something maybe edit  also got lots stuff nt know ai nt got realtek surprised 
wo nt show steamvr nt running  also guess audio fine steamvr running automatically switches hdmi audio instead usb 
could quality cable port  dp shared connections card  check hdmi audio settings nvidia control panel figure port try get dedicated one  disable audio types device manager exception onboard audio bit consistent  also try putting headset usb hub used anything else  check control panel  connections   actually made post  idea use separate pcie device lanes vive s many devices take advantage multi core cpu reduce frame timing latency improve cable bandwidth 
airmouse  tv realtek devices specific system  two steam streaming items steam ’ steam linkstyle streaming service relevant 
s dedicated usb 31 card  1080ti 2 display ports m using one main monitor  vive pro  cables ones came vive pro  yet occasionally start steamvr  nvidia high definition audio  connection appear normally  audio option  vive pro multimedia audio  works  set 44100hz sound properties default  s fine ve figured  definitely number audio bugs related steamvr vive pro worked yet  times works fine everything works perfect  ca nt tell different experiences 
version windows using  re using latest nvidia drivers something 1803 re gon na bad time  re designed fcu new audio stack 
m windows 10 1803  fact went 1803 1703 started problems  running flawlessly og vive upgrade 1803 try odyssey vive pro returning odyssey 
steamvr honestly worst sound 
literally almost unusable strapping getting vr half time steamvr forgets sound devices ve chosen output switch  even none  selects literally random inputs  m forced exit headset fix manually  s point turn speakers avoid spamming neighbors  frustrating critical software portions maintained  update  searching might caused windows brilliant usb   speculation according internet research  vive overwhelms weak usb bus causes reconnect wireless headset dongle  reconnects  gets assigned new gid thus steamvr loses track chooses random  2nd  realized  listen  feature windows reset steam  problem  suspect way fix steamvr implemented wrong 
yah latest windows10 update made issue even annoying  changing sound menu longer include playback devices diagnostic tool instead   s minor annoyance get used annoyance nonetheless  able slice blocks another world without hiccups   virtualworldproblems
issues disabled playback devices except speakers use vive output jack  auto switching works correctly since setting steamvr settings  sound page 
openvr advancedsettings  install  neat steamvr tool   option change sound devices  dont take headset  takes 2 secs  yeah  feel pain 
use voicemeeter banana handle audio seamlessly switch desktop speakers  usb headset rift also sending audio bass transducer chair times  set vb default playback recording device set oculus home steam never change devices  extra virtual audio channels super handy separate discordteamspeak audio game volume 
going buck trend  works perfectly  turn steamvr  speakers shut  vive headphones start playing    slightly related note  would prefer bit differently  would like steam app redirected  sound sources nt  example  youtube video playing chrome turn steamvr  nt really help sound video played vive 
’ weird sure  headphones plugged vive  works switch steam vr  however  ’ plugged switch  stay whatever device sound going  ’ difficult figure really  bit simpler perhaps 
yep s pretty damn terrible  one biggest annoyances steamvr  nt even bother trying make work anymore  change manually 
yeah  something  works  rift steamvr needs catch  whenever launch something steam make sure turn speakers first 
never issue  ve never headset startup without sound everytime tell mirror audio tv honors  m using dedicated vr gaming rig though  s office computer  computer wakes vr games 
every time start fix sound  openvr advanced settings helps lot since tab change audio 
never problem steamvr automatically switching default audio output devices 
use  https  githubcommatzman666openvradvancedsettings   https  githubcommatzman666openvradvancedsettings  handle audio vr nt take headset  could try using workaround  integrates dashboard overlay  problems using notebook would automatically start intel graphics instead nvidia card 
go windows sound options disable every single sound input output except vive headset  mic  soundsystem  like 10  hdmi audio  optical audio  usb audio  use disabled  makes steamvr play really nice
used tons issues sound like  m suprised one mentioned voicemeeter banana yet  duplicate sound like steam vr supposed actually works
nope  u
 deleted 
click  sounds  open old window 
issue shitty steam streaming speaker keeps getting recreated steam every time reboot  enables  often sets default device 
ooo good idea  forget 
also use voicemeeter nt change settings  still allways shutdown steamvr changes motherboards audio output 
m actually using vac sound line streaming vr  exit switches back wireless headset nt get audio delay    good idea though  would stop gid reset
re one  rarely problem always open vr settings easily change back  also mirror sound desktop case forget  quite thing helps 
ve issue want speakers headphones playing  mirroring nt working perfectly 
never used steamvr   
using vac effect  audio repeater programs introduce latency  sub 25ms  undesirable  esp  rhythm games 
ve always done  using desktop view steamvr  trigger think left click  nt changed 
fyi  volume control nt effective re intentionally mirroring  demoing vr s always hassle 
thanks 
happens disable steam streaming functionality 
steam vr setting editing steam vr  set  nt change device  also 
hundreds times  always switches first defined may 2016 switches back exit 
would nt steamvr audio mirror latency 
disabled never use inhome streaming  still recreates  like everything else steam platform  s probably buggy hell 
yes  set  nt change  steamvr 
must luckiest guy earth 
yes mirror works fine  issue default device switching logic 
get pc audio stay speakers vr audio comes hmd like oculus home 
way steamvr  seems like either full speakers  full hmd mirrored  want everything nt vr related come pc speakers vr related stuff come vr  like home

one sound  bend  naturally around obstacles  steam audio sdk disappointed room door  put sound source outside wall material 100  occluded audio absolutely zero sound made room unless walked door got line sight source  set outside wall reflect audio door 
well  re asking much steam audio point  also could lack tuning  guess htc s sdk mobile phones rather pc 
yes，it could reproduce sound  bend  phenomenon smoothly  much sound would occlueded depends upon portion sound source blocked obstacle  raycast geometric mode  represent two different algorithms trick  please try occlusion effect example vive 3dsp sdk 
supports windows pc  unity  unreal cclibrary 
hmm steam audio sdk could create geometric source  yes large sphere source partially occluded wall s really mean  bending  propagatingdiffracting door  different  principle able sound source totally behind wall  still sound waves propagate door next  steam audio issue using straight raycasts rather simulating something like pressure waves reference  https  wwwdocsitycomwordpresswpcontentuploadssites2201409diffraction1jpg see spacialization would audio coming door room rather source
hmm  s point first place  already steam audio  especially since htc valve working relatively close collaboration  htc software company 
yes  vive 3dsp occlusion could mean  said problem steam audio uses one straight ray raycast  vive 3dsp  could set number rays want  brings diffraction effect depending many rays use  geometric occlusion already considered diffraction therefore nothing set  encourage download vive 3dsp sdk try example scene unity unreal plugin  download link  https  developervivecomresourcesknowledgebasevive3dspsdk2
point view  great hardware design enough bring immersive experience user  therefore great spatial audio also must  htc many excellent software features apps  hardware manufacturer  vive 3dsp steam audio quite different  vive 3dsp easier use better spatial effect  download compare 
cool give test chance consider next project
sure  better spatial effect   since phonon  branded steam audio   years making serious spatial audio project  spatial audio effect like  bathroom   cave   simulation actual sound physics behavior  problem serious toolkits like steam audio  s hard undestand use indie dev  want things work  audio engineering serious thing require knowledge skills  s easy thing amateurs  sound engineer team  quite savvy guy

agree lot  m skilled enough community songs expert soon see song downloaded ridiculous drum beat simulator instantly quit delete take fun song game  ve wanting start making quality beat maps m sick people making  officially custom songs added m hoping makes quality bit better 
 beat saber  prediction  add custom beatmaps  playlists become saturated beatmaps made exclusive purpose making miss  s already begun  wars  stylish workout dance saber   stationary drum hero super extreme beatmap edition   ll find customs fall latter category  nt care 1000 notes 2 minute song  nt care leaderboards  want nice chill workout lightsabers set music  original tracks great  ubennydabeast great tracks  nt help main custom track download site way search songs intelligent way  way filter difficulty  way filter number notes notes per minute  rating system  s even builtin feature include youtube playthroughs songs  makers post comments even think  s bit disappointing see game slide towards beat maniacs  hope devs come original songs make sense get moving instead dick measuring contest

would recommend mcosu like normally best app types  think beat saber beat  mcosu free though 
tired custom beat maps already  first ones excellent nothing music hard sake hard  ’ even follow beat 
1 try ubennydabeast s beatmaps  re probably best flowing beat maps game date  significantly better even ones base game  ok  s done better  also done much worse   2 game needs tools  eg  ability delete custom songs within game  opposed going folder   importantly  finer tiered difficulty ranks  instead easymediumhardexpertexpert  difficulty ranks need numbers go 30s  need modifiable user vote  eg  game ask songs ve played  try compare difficulty    reasonable accurate difficulty rankings songs allow users ladder climb highest skill levels  s always validity various levels difficulty  current way things makes difficult frustrating figure whether something range  help grow   way outside nt bother  addition difficulty rank  probably flow  rank well  chart moderated  incentivized  entirely difficulty  rather motivates beat mappers create fun  interesting  flowing  still challenging beat maps  eg  psy gangham style beat map 
d prefer beatmaps encourage something like choreographed fighting style dancing drumming
completely agree  90  custom beatmaps shit right  many packed notes hit ca nt even see arrows next blocks dozens blocks front  chance memorize every block  frustrating play 
lot really good soundboxing creators making tracks good built beat saber songs  game nt made easy find tbh featured songs updated lot recently big help  nt gotten saber custom tracks yet would bet s  tracks great others great

totally agree point audioshield  soundboxing  seems like people s idea  hard  levels  tire player quickly possible   s super fun   beat saber inevitably get crap like  custom stages thing  s quality stuff refined releasing game  really hope firstparty stages time  maybe add  like  option rating custom stages

one thing ve noticed custom tracks  sound actually hitting blocks loud completely drowns outdistracts actual song  especially re basesnare heavy like default tracks  something missing able turn offdown 
like sandstorm  map impossible  lol
audioshield cool nt sync properly  major disappointment mind serious flaw game based principle 
found hard bother enough finish even one song audioshield  s kind stale like audiosurf beat hazard  unless like songs picked  marathoned beat saber normal right away m considering trying extreme stuff  s fun  feel like re inside game music instead throwing arms like fool  definitely something described  audioshield simply sucks comparison beat saber 
watch beat saber twitch stream  morgantitv
rows cubes ca nt even see hidden behind cubes bombs hidden inside walls ca nt see  s becomes frustrating  mislabeled hard maps  actually quadruple hard   d fail 100 times row see blocks memorize move make  love beat saber  please stop  space blocks see headed towards us

1 1 point  steer newish players far away custom songs found like 
someone finds stock songs expert easy  enjoy harder difficulty custom maps  9 hours played game  nt take long start acing expert songs play goal beating expert  certain patterns come even custom songs  learn quick elegant ways hitting patterns lot beatmaps become trivial  say play game enough re tired stock songs want  re probably level wanting challenging songs 
try gangnam  xenogenesis  belive  sail rasputin
thinking thing  finally got chance download customs terrible  especially brilliance vanilla songs  hard made sense  nt fun 
needs way sort casual  actually decent songs others 
agree wholeheartedly expert maps nt really fun  nt even try anymore  buuuut end every modder likes every right  fun hope focus us normal users  luckily immensely grateful instead telling others 
yes  ’ great summary  paraphrase something op wholeheartedly agree  builtin tracks rhythm flow  never try trick  sections even get away without consciously analysing block direction  almost always transition one next one feels best  really hope  expect  get new builtin tracks ’ follow philosophy

sounds like content creators much better everyone else would boring waste time make easier tracks  make tracks satisfy people easy play   people itt expect content creators cater personally free  s entitled 
s one favorite maps  s super technically challenging damn nt one best work outs whole game 
looking someone talk one  beat maps ve tried one s nailed balance tracks s fun hell play also decent challenge 
agreed  custom maps try  clever  instead fun
personally think ttfaf terrible  flow  chopping 
 better yet need show beatmaps sorted total player points earned  people would vote many times play map  naturally d divide scores number notes song  notes  possible points   something like would solve problem right quick 
biggest problem nt finding normal beatmaps    hard  beatmaps pretty accessible   expert  nt   s finding music like

two good ones  yeah game definitely nt going die custom beatmaps nt reason recommend game  right s 10 tracks maybe want two 
waggle score suffer  game engine encourages waggle 
problem keep audio shield consistently watch orbs glitch shields  yes hitting right shield right color   kills competitive record runs really like  nt happen rhythm game experience 
yeah sounds like someone nt play audioshield much  even balls edges easy see re distance  forces pay attention plan moves advance  helps get zone better 
er  beatsaber nt really game memorization  agree fov though  nt think audioshield trying make miss notes noisy backgrounds  beatsaber s original tracks good customs  notes close together color going alternating updown  nt need see  need see color  even  never different colors  row  notes  notice general patterns  read songs easily beat saber  feels overwhelming first  really little memorization 
play  think  nt tried one s little actual gameplay trailer 
nt think get means  play shit game m already seeing trend beatmaps upvoted involve non slicing random circular movements nt feel like belong people play alot adds challenge vs fun  find fun nt first
first  awesome playlists soundboxing  re getting hard find  re overwhelmed  sith lord   liked description  playlists  believe beat saber popular   right  dev add ability custom beatmaps  curated rhythm based  sith lords come amakin   game  quality  drop tremendously  m seeing  anyway 
vast  vast majority detest focus difficulty  re normal gamers leading normal lives  likely haunting discord reddit threads  s dozen hardcore elite types seem think carry weight  90000 people wanting play beatmaps ca nt reached comment 
case would nt even consider buying game 
’ great custom beat maps  game custom song managerdownloader  find custom songs   game   ’ easy find good ones 
kind idiotic  makes devs uniquely qualified  made like 10 songs year  would nt hold breath  nt think intend add  simply going add map maker  first question game user generated levels  someone made mod allowing buy game 
devs songs easily best quite excellent custom ones well  lots great music nt get represented frequently rhythm games 
s hard s failing miserably feel like re playing song  lot people add shit ton notes make harder without actually contributing song  want show dexterity rhythm gamer make really shitty videos 
 currently population beatmap makers skewed towards difficult end spectrum  far represented published beatmaps pretty much always case custom level design anything  hence insane number kaizo mario romhacks nostalgic platforming community   dedicated people make custom levels  tend far  far better game new players  s really hard  good game make compelling easy level 
looking forward rating system  features  may may already planned would like see   rate song immediately playing  game  score screen  overall ratingenjoyment song stars  15   able rate different categories  beat accuracy  innovation  beat mappers found really cool new patterns   map design 
worst thing everyone rates tracks expert  regardless difficult actually  cascada s every time touch  supposedly difficulty through fire flames   even close 
yeah  honest  custom song map ve tried enjoyed far gangnam style  s one normal difficulty mapping  creator good job making match song 
uh 🤤 yeah  could go ahead link charts  d awesome  sound damn amazing  even knowing little creators  need 
overtime cash cash fun map flows well opinion 
believer vision blocks annoying  also notice version america played last night three different difficulty settings  would nt surprised author used lower difficulty sketch ideas added complications fill challenge 
’ worry “ switching sides ” blocks  ’ well telegraphed  see transitioning  rather appearing already wrong side  ’ done enough reflexes take pretty much nail without even consciously thinking 
blocks swapping coming really ’ problem  happens far enough plenty time hit right  harder difficulties probably ’ even paying attention yet swap
think switching purpose  done make obvious opposite order  actually see blocks  seems default orientation pointing rotate actual orientation 
s sort issue beat games like ddr groove  lot insanely hard songs hard insanely high bpm step rate extremely difficult maintain physically   like need top shape possibly either good athlete teens 20s   fun songs good rhythm challenging steps highly technical still beattones song  high bpm spamfests grueling unenjoyable 
thanks bringing rustic attention  playing mapped songs  favourite mapper  unfortunately nt really like freeek s songs  taste little hectic drum like 
yet  posted request rbeatsaber creators please add skill levels  freeek chastised request  entitled  responded threat make easier levels  go figure 
yes  soundboxing worst  look robots look like ’ seizure  sound  boxing  boxing name  least try make look like ’ tangentially boxing related 
rasputin go good dance
agree agreeing  yep    also  friend nt vr gets play comes hang  pretty much thing wants vr play audioshield cause s big music fan  mostly plays easy setting nt care much messes  s mostly able pick favorite songs play  s also huge star wars fan also likes play lightblades  told beatsaber  ca nt wait try  thing  know bit let  wo nt able pick song wants b  probably get frustrated quick  d definitely turn fail mode could get song  s shame  would perfect mashup  end limiting ll quickly lose interest go back 
ve rhythm games 15 years ve pretty much described  m driven ranking others  m constantly competing  game nt constantly pushing limit lose interest quickly 
guess need beatmap genres like music genres  would totally download  lowfi hiphop chillbeatsaber 
think made point well  agree  always exist audiences want grind competition   occasionally find seeking games little competition  already play highly competitive games  imagine certain majority distribution make new beatmaps seek something challenging  make maps want play  s like hobbiest roller coaster architect  thing ever existed   presumably re building rides think thrill people  especially  would hard convince one architects build something simple still takes time effort  nt plan riding  maybe m wrong  simple plea would nt much change interests  ultimately blamelessly build interests 
 builtin tracks rhythm flow  never try trick  appreciated base tracks gone though played custom ones  song something unique learn  completely flubbed  nt fail  new movement  trick   like colors flipping sides  done way made clear needed  needed pay attention  try develop godlike reflexes  related note  hah   played custom song  never noticed blocks actually make sounds hit  point blended well rythm songs never noticed

ttfaf feels like drumming  personally find fine ton satisfying parts outside repetitive drumrolls
way prove point   say dislike hard maps without totally lying falsely exaggerating  honestly sound like re really upset re good enough play challenging maps re projecting frustration people s issues calling autistic ’ entirely asinine false  dislike insane maps reasons besides lack skill  ace built maps expert fine  ’ sure could practice learn beat insane custom ones people made   ’ want   ridiculous top ones ’ tried far ’ even fun  would bother wasting time  ’ saying one make top difficult maps  people like  ’ happy ’ people want  people make maps complain community sucks casual players ’ want maps one makes easier ones asinine 
 say dislike hard maps without totally lying falsely exaggerating  honestly sound like re really upset re good enough play challenging maps re projecting frustration people s issues calling autistic also saying rubbish like ca nt even last 15 seconds  100 bill expert  yet still play game every single day much fun  custom songs match skill level  m starting get bored  matter  git gud   would nt bother play game period since m even good easiest song hardest difficulty  btw  casual players keep community alive  hardcore players keep dying 
s funny mentioned typical spectrum hardcore elitists like first sentence two  s one prove point

play hard expert going back normaleasy like going playground slide meant ages 03 ve day aqua park  see good genre easier difficulties would seem useless put effort 
think rating songs immediately best way engage people voting  thumbs thumbs certain categories  5star issues   allows community filter songs mapped poorly  sync issues  issues

nailed  could nt said better  sure prove point  elitist onthespectrum re mad cause re good us mentality truly  astonishing  though s literally way enjoy game except best challenging things  though could anyone find something fun nt challenging  simply nt  understand   comprehend  majority people enjoy games  completely different reasons aside striving ultimate beatsaber master   like said  spectrum  s actually common  notice lot communities well  play lot board  miniatures games s always someone simply ca nt enjoy board game unless re  winning   best   whereas everyone else interested good time  needless say nt popular people 
default maps expert absolutely easy though  s thing  genre usually way demanding vanilla beat saber maps offer  reach top fast  eventually difficulty gets stale  increase difficulty expected  s reasonable  take lot sizeable rhythm games  like iidx  popn  sdvx  would nt even 13rd difficulty ladder time master highest difficulty default beat saber maps  maps wellmade hard time  eventually maps wo nt hard anymore  naturally play improve

even  nt necessarily need devs make songs  songs mostly lyrics  m sure re talking  would want people make beat maps instrumental music  s plenty usermade instrumental content soundboxing  s certainly several instrumental ones beat saber already  devs specific think need ones make 
sure thumbs immediate rating would result ratings  think people like things  differently   maybe like star ratings  updown ratings  least percentage absolut number ratings 
really hate simple thumbs upthumbs  adding least neutral category improves rating system lot opinion  many times gamesongwhatever nt necessarily strong updown  feel way nt rate guess  sort skews ratings since like hate item question rate  biggest issue steam s ratings system  games nt necessarily thumbs  nt warrant thumbs either  re outright bad  mediocre  maybe game enjoyable issues would cause recommend  still considering actually bad

guess trust devs know game  intended  nt trust random people internet  especially random people competitive   hardcore   something prove  ie  leaderboards   people people  may well completely different species  m interested  produce 
okay yeah get behind 
spectrum clear someone thinks s comparison standard moderately difficult beatsaber map  98  people playing  children s book  needs comment 
think even standard  easy  beating expert  first 10 songs taking people like 45 hours total play time  even demoing game nonvr users ve starting people hard expert re getting 95   37  within couple runs  67 yo mother songs expert  s really difficult  also  going make content  people play game lot  people nt 
ve seen people get bored default expert maps 810 hrs gametime  divided different days  mean easy  takes abnormal amount time clear  well  unfortunately maybe problem  autistic  people dare spend 8ish hours game   nt skill level agree  re autistic  get life   s hilarious  honestly  maybe s  closed system mentality   thinking everyone agrees default  nt spectrum  get perspective  lad 
 everyone agrees  nt autistic  opinion represents majority  know m right  nt realize reality   pretty funny re mentioning egos  re clearly extremely bloated  lol 
dude  ve got problem autism  stop calling everyone disagree spectrum  s rude 
  s literally almost proven fact   sentence literally makes sense 
re making maps 12  community hardcore enough sit around practicing putting 1020 hours every week  openly admittedly ignoring maps 98  would want playing  re idiot  s plain simple  nt even  real debate  might well arguing water nt wet 
guess nt trust devs  release unfinished game nt clear timeline finish 
s though ve never met normal person 
well  s really clear outsider  happens tiny community bubble syndrome  get group dozen hardcore people together  friends hardcore mode stuff  nt actually talk 99950 people purchased game might play hour two week  really nt understand  extreme  minority  people play beatsaber fun insane difficulty level also going show discord reddit threads regarding beatsaber  re heavily invested  nt make less relevant  fact  relevant  consider s 90000 dozen hardcore spectrum types   someone else said  exactly gaming communities work  98  majority keep game alive  hardcore minority simply keep dying  would legitimately spectrum ignorant fact vast  overwhelming majority people purchase play game absolutely desire train hard accomplish insane beatmaps    s asinine 95  custom songs difficulty  s quite literally detrimental community way  many already mentioned 
dated girl worked people spectrum exactly textbook way act  could quite literally pull behaviour pattern clinical journal  s insult  s statement fact  s pretty common sense  anyone puts 1000 hours single rhythm game  literally basic definition  undoubtedly likely somewhere spectrum  s nothing wrong  nt make stupid  mean often miss nuanced  normal  approach things  purposely  simply legitimate understand  s see  everyone lazy jealous skill  responses  s way comprehend 
m sure  one many people spectrum offended s pointed re spectrum 
overall  nt play video games general 23 days play  s everyday  late  re taking someone plays 10 hrs day  everyday  realize deep fantasy  lol 
impressive keep typing several paragraphs state   people like  agree  nt spectrum   probably makes feel better  righteous  s pretty pointless  also  taking assumptions truth  would say s worthwhile cater portion community plays 1 hr week  ones play  enjoying easy maps fine  thinking everyone cater  despite playing 1 hr week  entitled  adding  people create maps going  1 hr week  type person   said easy maps going extremely boring  even extreme default maps going boring  takes couple hours reach skill level  request  even taking consideration random numbers  reasonable  want people create maps ll boring  cater players barely touch game  instead players active circles  comment give inputs  noticeably enjoy game  considering play 1 hr per week   think would nt detrimental  lastly  re hilariously overestimating hard game  many people clear extreme default maps  play bit demand people bow  perhaps 
 sorry  nt see response  m spectrum  comprehend normal  nuanced approach things  try analyze  yes   expert levels beat saber pretty easy  nt think  normal  people lazy bad  different approach things  know nt mean insult  nt really like use autism way discredit criticize lack understanding  work really hard try get people work  s tough hear someone thinking totally incapable work 
someone better nt automatically make autistic 
wow  excellent example person  wife special ed teacher  boy  people like whole different level asshole  making fun disabilities using insult others  yeesh  hope child ’ learned decent human 
m taking someone asked  think s worth catering 98  gamers playing game  incredibly tiny minority   without hint irony sarcasm  s  literally mind boggling stupid question 
s incredibly sad spectrum world ve literally missed every single point made thread   would say s worthwhile cater portion community plays 1 hr week  ones play   yes  jesus h read single thing  catering hundred hardcore people keeps game alive  read op  nerds going  donate two grand month keep alive sales drop 99900 people nt want play insane difficulty beatmaps  literally  dense  understanding basic concept  blinded little club ultra skilled beatwarriors ve completely lost touch reality  exactly happens sorts communities  s irony  guys openly admitting interested exclusively making content 1  community cares enough train  practice constantly  devote actually get good enough play  defend decision   unironically turn around first bitch moan community dies everyone else left   blows mind nt insanely obvious even uninterested observer 
m kidding say mentality  clear indicator autism  autistic people generally understand reasons regular people things  comprehend reasoning something   difficult try understand normal behaviour implicit  subconscious way normal person would  group dedicated  likely onthespectrum beatsaber insane people trouble understanding well nine tenths entire active community desire even  attempt  get good enough play insane difficulty simply  care find concept fun   get autistic people say things like  crybabies jealous aint good cryin cause lazy practice  saying reason people nt want play insane difficulty either  ca nt get good b  lazy  someone spectrum  quite seriously one dimension  fun  trouble understanding somebody else  say  vast majority  could also take  fun  huge variety completely different directions s  m joking   s  textbook behaviouralism autistic people 
 think s worth catering people barely play game  nt participate community  ones often participate community seem enjoy game  thus play   remember  ones catering players  ones want force appeasing finding game worthwhile enough improve  s almost like nt really enjoy game  want people cater times feel like touching  absolute entitlement  1000 people play week every week  100 people play constantly participate community  think makes game alive  s though barely comprehend works 
oh man  ignorant think community makes maps mostly people play 1 hour week successful  people nt even participate discord circles  according  re catering people barely participate begin  also   re asking people find boring make easy maps  make easy maps  cause nt interested enough game learn  re essentially stating nt find game worthwhile improve  top want people like game cater  insane  hypothetical came accepting numbers  remember s lot people clear extreme default maps think  cause nt hard  clear playing days  maybe 1 2 hrs day  simple  dunno re passionate game nt seem enjoy enough put actual effort aside complaining people  m part  elite club  community  way  people re calling  autistic elitists  play barely 12 hours every day  days  s enough get extreme default maps 
 group dedicated  likely onthespectrum beatsaber insane people trouble understanding well nine tenths entire active community desire even attempt get good enough play insane difficulty  get autistic people say things like  crybabies jealous aint good cryin cause lazy practice  saying reason people nt want play insane difficulty either  ca nt get good b  lazy  unless show happening beat saber community  m going chalk accusations deep seated inferiority complex 
 https  wwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc5488854   https  wwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc5488854  s good place start educating  re pretty stupid come conversation like actual knowledge behind offended  feelings hurt behalf people  pathological use games   ie becoming addicted game  playing far average person would consider healthynormal  much  much prevalent among autistic people others  words  re kind person ends putting 1000 hours rhythm game everyone else outside regular life things  s  good chance re spectrum  science  uneducated peon   results indicated adults asd endorsed symptoms video game pathology td adults  relationship strong  enjoying 300000to1 odds bayesian model comparison  results also showed adults asd spent daily hours playing video games spent higher percent free time playing video games td adults  
math hilariously bad self defeating  hahahahaha  think important activity game  huge majority  minority  huh  answer   literally nt encountered someone says shit makes look dense often long time 
s  astounding re basically putting fingers ears  s  making maps mostly people play 1 hour week   s  making maps 98  people want able play  literally lying purposely dumb  s  insane someone could legitimately dense still able formulate coherent words 
s happened half dozen times thread  hahahaha
lol belong riamverysmart smart  say autistic people hard time understanding people s feelings motives misunderstand people make content make  want easier tracks  make  reason people making content nt like satisfy  community   re smug asshole btw 
s correlation autism gaming addiction  top leaderboards  leaderboard ranks awarded points  hours   words  re kind person ends putting 1000 hours rhythm game everyone else outside regular life things  s  good chance re spectrum  beat saber came may 1st  24 hours day  27 x 24  648 hours  s fact  math

 alfa 
fire flames epic 
would amazing editor vr  could go motions song playing whenever pull trigger  would save place block direction swinging  maybe song slowed 
meantime  mod insert custom songs  ve put together    quick guide     https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v8ii6fuzkfqe   s also stuff make custom songs convert stepmania files 
good move  needs get hype dies 
whoever  dragonforce through fire flames  going kill people heartattacks least send people hospital strained muscles

uhhhh  everyone getting downvoted lowerrecent comments 
good move  needs get hype dies 
nt disney history suing anything remotely resembling lightsaber content 
understand hype game 0   audio shield 2 seems infinitely superior  someone please explain  super bummed coming game  playing game could play literally bit music internet drop hat techno songs choose 
well  steam workshop integration might best route  guess beatmaps s  ca nt host useruploaded music distribute  steam would shut 
well internet shouting crying throwing tantrum apparently nt much choice release early 
sorry single  many people act like dev s game clueless unaware improve game  even early acess  far away one polished accurate vr games got  game rocking 99   37  positive review rate  went far give us write store page game right  offers  plan add  compared early access feel like quick funding grab keep em going  even 10 tracks feels like good  solid game  feel large amount confidence devs 
d prefer way similar soundboxing  select list ingame without go workshop
dont call alfa version ll upset
alfalfa
english probably nt first language  laughing crying emoji 
like sound  could run song multiple times  adding  changing box directions hitting  maybe deleting mistakes hitting sabers quantizing option afterwards allow correct small timing errors 
might bad move release game without 
 m ready  bring fire flames

audio shield 2  coming soon 
adding youtube song streaming ala audioshield custom tailored beat data could alright
osu   could nt settle however manage 
mean  dmca could still oissivlr  hut tabletop simulator let copyrighted material request made 
add something file youtube url  problem solved 
dmca safe harbor  take get dmca  see viacom vs youtube  whether steam allow  since invite lawsuit different
likely trying get ahead editor mod released morning  could generate lot beat maps may break future update product create lot shouting  crying  tantrums people invested lot time creating beat maps longer supported 
 shouting crying throwing tantrum aka internet best
yea sure
 many people act like dev s game clueless unaware improve game  good 90  devs early access indie titles indeed clueless unaware fuck  devs seem alright  s really mystery people conditioned react way

someone make mod   hope 
think disney could feasibly draw legal battle one  devs open s lightsaber inspired word saber name
nah  ’ played  auto generation fantastic actually scales much better beat saber  ’ played every difficulty beat saber even ’ necessarily keep harder ones yet  ’ compare 
hit audioshield 2 ’ ’  auto generation fantastic almost time  ’ never anything fun 
m sure s saying audio shield 2  s thing
problem think syncing  every youtube video going length  would likely issues well  even map specific video  might blocked regions get taken number things  osu  s system pretty much best one feel  entire thing packed one file run automatically unpack files  audio  beatmaps etc  whatever folder  file  https  iimgurcom7madlugpng running opens game automatically  installs  beatmap  audio file  metadata  background image  hitsounds etc  https  iimgurcom6ybh7pvpng folder creates looks like https  iimgurcomsf4zxvopng

made comment lol  https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments8hgsfrbeatsaberontwittersoonwewillreleasealfadyk9h20
yeah  money  s good thing really  release tool even though s alpha  let community get lose hype train  wanted stream twitch d basically one maybe two good streams currently  anything simply viewers  game  10 songs good s enough playing many times  worried going take way long putting d lose momentum fantastic release  opinion getting tool fast humanly possible  taking time anything else smart way  m really glad case  disagree comment shouting  crying  tantrum  etc  nt actually see nastiness  fans extremely pleased release desperately wanting content play especially re streamer youtuber  one fans level modding discord said   beat saber releasing 10 songs custom track creation tool rhythm gaming equivalent making beautiful girl couch hour immediately going home instead   nt new hardcore rhythm game long simply teased 
truth  history early 21st century may go  age complaining 
s idiotic way thinking  devs bad devs bad  opiniois people fucking stupid  thye cant see devs game trying best cash grabbing idk say 
lol matter time 
saber pretty common word swords though  hardly something s remotely trademarkable

ve played hell audioshield beatsaber ton fun  audioshield random  fast  great well done beatsaber beatmap flow makes greater experience  future problem think making well published beat map difficult lot songs way long people endure  beatsaber songs 25 mins part traditional song 4 exhausting play exhausting craft 
m sorry  think audioshield s autogen fantastic ear rhythm  audioshield 2  unless re talking mod something 
  nt know satisfaction beating expert even hard   tries review game
 s absolutely rhythm large part   auto generation fantastic  please pick one lol    ’ played every difficulty ’ necessarily keep harder ones yet  room say s worse game  cant complete levels best beat nt actually tried game  go try song alot obstacles expert hard sweating ass
 s absolutely rhythm large part   auto generation fantastic  please pick one lol    ’ played every difficulty ’ necessarily keep harder ones yet  room say s worse game  cant complete levels best beat nt actually tried game  go try song alot obstacles expert hard sweating ass
’ ear rhythm  sorry
 literally told opposite shilling game hard  s one thing love gams defend s beat maps one auto generated handmade laughable 
work copyright  nt 
yeah meant someone manually creates track syncs properly x song pulls track data wan na play x video youtube
well said 
s disney  bunch legal terrorists 
s way re getting sued user created mods nt even remotely provided tools support  could even implement mode game call  staff mode   fans could still call whatever want  even disney  s frivolous winning case  given popularity overwhelming love game  doubt disney wants bad gaming related star wars pr whole battlefront 2 ea thing 
yeah think ultimately ’ people prefer beat saber ultimately love audioshield way  makes sweat heart pound hour  beat saber fun song two get bored day   ’ peoples experience 
audioshield  s absolutely rhythm large part  entirely s infinitely active beat saber  s hell lot fun autogen beat sabers crafted handful songs could best defeat minor wrist movements head movement 
lmao
nt know re getting downvoted  think s valid question  nt know answer sure  best guess would osu s system legal grey area  songs uploaded users  site runners probably nt liable hosting copywritten songs  would required comply takedown requests  also  lot music legitimately free stuff  japanesekorean music  imagine less often enforced due companies owning music overseas  though every see american songs  assume get away osu nt extremely popular  also osu nt make money game aside donations  companies slightly less incentive come 
 auto generation fantastic actually scales much better beat saber  ’ played every difficulty beat saber even ’ necessarily keep harder ones yet  ’ compare   really saying beatsaber hard rofl  see nt like beat missing alot boxes hard expert ruins beat
 minor wrist movements  wo nt get points though  score almost entirely based good swings  audioshield hand  stay mostly static whole thing take minor penalty  since style score pretty much relevant re trying get  1 leaderboard  guess autogen nt bad re playing songs clearly audible beats  anything else though  pop classical whatever  nothing match  even little bit 
except want score maximum points  make 90 degree movements etc  wiggle wrist 
 s hell lot fun autogen beat sabers crafted handful songs could best defeat minor wrist movements head movement  another comment said ca nt even harder songs beat saber  
adore beat saber  comments always make wonder version audioshield yall playing  base difficulties truly bad  lot people seem miss fact audioshield less rhythm game melody game  think algorithm far worse actually  beatmap often change instrument focus love  s lot music beat 
 deleted 
best defeat  easily defeat 
problem experience   nt  follow melody  favorite osu  maps ones follow melody  m currently working beat saber map mapped melody drums  song feels much better play beat saber audioshield  said  like audioshield  s bad game means  generator makes good map  damn feels good  lot time  put purple right right climax  map climax  feels really bad  change instruments  consistently like human mapper would  osu  maps tend follow singer  accompaniment singing   note held   drums accompaniment holding notes  audioshield maps sometimes follow drums singing  sometimes follow accompaniment instead  sometimes sick guitar focus percussions  etc  thing  overall quality maps much better human mapping  song nt work well algorithm  re going able play song game  bad map manually mapped game  someone else make good map 
audioshield gameplay doesnt match game  beat saber feel like playing guitarhero  audioshield feel like playing bejeweled music 
yeah  ve played mods fun   even harder  mod floating around right game s release really nice  even  still nt even nearly nice humanmapped songs  nt main game usergenerated maps soundboxing  game nt really editor  generate maps punching beat  right  yeah  see would lead meh maps 
s true either  though  since game gives points based swings  minor wrist movements would allow barely beat game  definitely  best defeat  said 
oh yeah  sure  adore beat saber  nt know perhaps musical taste simple mod lot favours algorithm personally feel lot audioshield hate least somewhat unfair  especially trying alternatives  view nuanced elegant though  m used seeing unbridled disrespect around comes audioshield finally felt need stick  seem chosen last person would need discuss though  haha  yes  certainly agree beat saber far polished experience m super excited handmade maps  always love audioshield tiding 
 deleted 
well  nothing simple taste    taste probably close whatever algorithm tuned  custom difficulty mods definitely help audioshield already process song somewhat well  since usually make circles map closer song  mods ca nt fix cases map completely wrong suddenly decides base random instrument nt playing melody 
 unfortunately well s taste    feel like main reason spent significantly time audioshield music like works well algorithm  personally like japanese music   blame osu    holodance works well  ve found maybe 3 songs like work really well audioshield  even  s always part songs  song sortakinda maps well  section spot feels amazing  s section  rest ok far  beat saber perfect maps everything  usergenerated maps thanks mod editor came earlier today nt even compare audioshield even holodance  since process making map involved beat saber  hope someone taste makes map songs want   always make map yourself

 know multiplayer never part game stated  however going add multiplayer   come  know answer  asking wo nt change 
yerp  update actually added riftspecific tutorial signage new sampler platter intro scene 
given take hold mode try  far stationary targets 
nope  42 new guns added course update 52 s development  almost 190 firearms game  still growing 
closer 1500
m sorry dude  
yup yup  make sure room really well lit tracking solid 
 s good idea  think best add sort  demo mode  least  probably add set hotkeys

’ stretching 
yup yup   added update 52 s alpha phase  
audio mixing much simpler steam s  finished  much computationally expensive  amazing tho  
wish would comment selling work devs  gun mechanics great seems every fps dev going need make scratch buy possible
likely  jointed objects nt perf expensive  re really unstable  also  objects h3 always live  physics objects  jointed objects push back  know breakaction shotguns little wibblyunstable  magnify 510x  s joint chain would end

thank kind sir
awesome  thanks speedy reply  m going get  edit  downloading  ll trying first thing morning
awesome  m soon get home tonight  ve wanted rift long time nt really checked rift support saw gif rgaming 
ll check  even shooting range though makes one top 3 games steam vive right  nt expecting huge update 
holy shit man s awesome 
yay
ok days earlier  ve keeping alpha branches  game getting better better  never thought sound would affect experience much  new sound system makes even pleasing shoot guns 
dope  thanks reply  actually nt need well lit room anymore  dimly lit works perfect  really improved previous update 
course  well  feel like dunce 
dedication project inspiring  kudos
nt mean offensive way  think work re outstanding hear nothing good things people  something m personally interested  would ever license gun mechanics someone looking make competitive single player game experience 
game requires goal competition  know s mini games  imagine re quite shallow lack substance long term replayability  d classify vr experience 
ah ’ simultaneously cool bummer ’ expensive  demos satisfying watch  choice words   makes visuals somehow much comprehensive physical audio  
would nt use devs  reason game single player minimalist environments gun object simulation that perf  expensive  one s computer powerful enough run 48 players running around guns complex

s alright  peeps need realize use terms like actual game   real game   etc   language works   saying line one side games get called games  games nt  ontologicalvalue judgement  one nt agree  gets incredibly angry someone drops face   nt plan several reasons  almost things make firearm handling simulation feel way h3 incredibly performance expensive  spending  cpu time  one player s worth  things nt feel work way games massive environments like fo4vr multiplayer vr titles noone s computer powerful enough  frankly takes two years constant work just working sorts things get place large collection weapons  ve rewritten closedbolt rifle system scratch 6  times  moreover  would nt possibly weld systems onto game  re vertically integrated  performance reasons   built entirely around player rig works  resources loaded  etc  literally whole game built aroundbent needs firearm system  s simply complex difficult keep running well 
question constitutes game seems difficult resolve look  bunch carefully proposed definitions presented  https  enmwikipediaorgwikigame overlap areas  conflict others  would full list necessary sufficient conditions  cmdrzander  far mention goal involving competition  plus long term replayability  add specific  yet  requirements  depth   substance   could offer anything specific two  two ways addressing sort quality  maybe  tic tac toe seems lack depth substance pretty much call game  s played generations sense long term replayability  personal level gets old pretty fast  anybody time killer definition  set criteria deserves called game 
s interesting  nt know  wonder hot dogs simple looking  thanks insight 
 somebody ask
coulda sworn hamburgers american stereotypes 
s one  need write multiple paragraphs trying deconstruct game game nt prove  game  within  20 experience  experience probably nt game  tic tac toe game  s game children  adults playing tic tac toe together  also would nt spend  20 play tic tac toe  matter complex experience build around many man hours took get point

first one installed  still nt understand 3d positional stereo nt given vr 
make sure download github  nexus mod nt updated recent version  horse gallop sounds like s underneath  looking sounds like s front  sounds real heck  helps ton pretty much every sound  much immersion tricking thinking m  sounds nt propagate hallways bounce objects properly  least direction realistic 
downloaded  thanks headsup  immersion improving mods 
s really great mod sucks little  implemented standard vr game  binaural audio super important vr  implemented standard  love vr guys  great mod must

mod also work version skyrim  want install second get  without single mod installed noticing great sound game last night  ca nt imagine much better installed  use 
ah yea  s right  remember complaint psvr version  cool 
 confirm s much better vanilla  example  re talking someone turning head sidetoside  hear directional audio transition one ear  someone one working ear  desperately wish superpower 
mod cost money download 
tried normal skyrim came  turned sound quality came  made sounds noticeably worse audio quality  might problem end something uninstall back  vr however  even somewhat lower audio quality would probably much worth 
wish  nt valve release plugin put type audio unity games  m even sure ve played game

 aw man  s super  really  sorts reasons one probably nt notice s gone  d list  would essay   notice sound get louder  softer transition way turn head  yes  s helpful details strongly depends acoustics surrounding area  situations someone one working ear reliably ascertain origin sound without using context clues like  edit  stereo sound gaming basically useless monaural people  headphones s taking away information  without headphones s adding uncertainty making half game harder hear  reason  fps games m always grateful important sounds given visual component well 
thank  try 
 removed 
actually nt know  nt even know two different ones  trying use another life game would nt start dragon borne beginning  boring cart ride made sick 
yes  people report newest ones good  tried nt feel 3d audio  reverted original 
s need surround sound vr anyway imo  since ears moving stereo  also mod rocks  s sounds skyrim d never heard
yeah  fun little thing  put normal  stereo set headphones  load  virtual barbershop  youtube  close eyes listen  surround sound headphones nothing gimmick many people fall 
sure  sounds good enough stick  otherwise  try nt anything makes worse delete files 
depending audio  generally 3d audio lot better virtual surround

never played p thought would like skyrim  skyrim se  especially since s separate full price game
 bad introduction vr lol

great stuff guys  thanks update  created script play space rotation entering degrees rotation play space degree field advanced settings whilst game  example  https  youtubekfo41lqjujw would love uykearapronouncedikea integrate game  could enable rotation smaller increments 1 whole degree create smoother rotation   allow 15 16 17 degrees  keep good work merry xmas  edit  btw anybody wants copy script ping message uses mouse keyboard simulator enter degrees

thanks 
get brightness slider  ’ started using animvr animate  ’ great sit couch chill couple hours gamma vive starts give headache  would nice tone brightness screen little 
thank much putting work 
awesome  way could add tab switch motion smoothing  either per application turning altogether  right need still use settings desktop  would welcome quality life thing inside headset
need delete anything install 
thanks 
thanks much continued development  downloaded 27 source certain things ’ seem work get compile errors audio manager audio controller tab  commented seem compile link coming understanding qt  qtvsaddin   could help compile options perhaps audio would great  got interested movement play space ’ seem work  expect xyz changes rotation changes happen immediately  correct  overlooked apply button  using seated position option boundary area  obviously need tool continue follow development  thanks  also  using reprojection – motion vector vr settings file see reprojection count statistics tab  finally  please store ini file documents directory matzman666 naming  using wmr win 10 beta steamvr note  playspace offsets rotation adjustments work set boundariesbased playspace seated position setup 
keep getting  failed  download error  try download exe  might wrong 
say fixadjust supersampling  whay exactly broken fixing  removing reprojection options adding motion smoothing options  also conflict using fpsvr  using old version mia dude s never given issues 
used provided direct command file microsoft compiler course works fine  would like compile project could use debugger visual studio 2017 ’ nice  thanks completeness package using boundaries  translation rotation works fine  notice rotation translations get little crazy add togetheras others stated  sure would nice could enable  disable motion vector smoothing since need use vr applications 
hey sorry ignorant  everyone seems happy ’ new vive owner ’ really clued anything
update versions independent merge featuresets occasionally directions  put changes  playspace axis tabs etc   build 5 days ago  made changes since  version features currently  might extensively tested versions  would recommend mine obviously  compatibility wise versions still good current steamvr beta 
think one point option send shortcuts  need look  somewhat low priority look 
simple change  might change input box accepts inputs  1 degree though  try 
s todo list implement granularity rotation slider  go granular rounding errors accumulate reset function nt perfectly return things back starting position  awesome script  alpha version advanced settings  ve altered rotation setting function centered hmd  would cause problems use case  test  https  githubcomykearaopenvradvancedsettingsrawalphakungadvancedsettingsalphakungzip m thinking might cause chaperone swing close re standing back near wall something

maybe  depends  probably possible though  correct answer 100  depends headset made  button sending steamvrwindows  hey mic muted  yes possible  headset stops sending steamvr information  also possibility htc way tell  nt expose developers 
really  fix  fpsvr  ll display mic active top right portion window 
night mode already exists  think might gamma control look 
yep super sampling profiles one next things going working  however 70  confident motion smoothing ca nt turned onoff via api yet 
nope run installer overwrite everything needs 
okay first things first  currently  translation  xyz  applies immediately  rotation apply s hitting  apply  button sounds like perhaps nt qt installed  necessity want build app  said throw compile errors  dm email please  take look  please also include headset using  aware matzmann subdirectory settings  list changed  relatively low priority  however someone helping refactoring right  little changed like going populated soonish  please also try setup roomscale see movement works  reprojection currently little broke addition motion smoothing  working next 
since changed repro options motion smoothing    x200b  1 verify api still properly supersample 2 verify reprojection options still work 3 hopefully find way enable motion smoothing 4 doper app settings app  maybe   5 general cleanup conflict nt know  nt used fpsvr  short answer probably issues  doubt would keep either running 
yea sorry  got new build script today  one bit mess  shut boundaries  still roomscale  setting fadedistance 0 chaperone tab  unfortuatly afaik via openvr touch motion smoothing  check   regardless updating reprojection options shortly  finishing issues audio profiles moving onto   oh ps  moved  permantly hopefully https  githubcomopenvradvancedsettingsopenvradvancedsettings  complicated  got couple people actively working  move org rather individual repos help us streamline deliver stable code 
 simply put advanced settings utility accessed overlay gives whole bunch settings options  people consider almost necessity things built steamopenvr  examples include  changing audio devices vr changing chaperone behavior vr adjusting height  fixing floor right height  etc  etc  bit biased like costs anything check xd
seems unnecessarily confusing  would nt easier everybody one repo issuesreleases kept together 
bump higher priority  s reason taking headset time 
would awesome  thanks
hi try later report back 
could always listen mic noise level s 
night mode huh  hmm  must older version advance settings  ’ never seen thing  ’ look 
would amazing  possible brightness  gamma contrast would epic
really possible change saturationbrightnesscontrastgamma  ve looking years  vive  rift  wmr  hint 
 ykeara  try suggestions report back  qt installed compile  link  execute audio portions  using vs2017  compile complains override area audiotabcontroller maybe areas  send email thanks much efforts 
fpsvr mandatory man  yeah supersampling still works repro options obviously nt work anymore  thank much effort project know lot us really appreciate 
thanks response  definitely seems helpful  im really use using github  like change code anything install works kind thing  guide chance  thanks lot  
offered upload straight icewind s turned least 
need take alttab  curious 
 kungvr  tried  nt work click apply button  entering degrees pressing enter key seem work  also tried virtual move short cut  works  think need lock floor default  esle get real mess      x200b 
default setting vive steamvr menu nothing advanced settings 
wow bit far back  https  githubcomopenvradvancedsettingsopenvradvancedsettings address 280 current release working 300 atm  eta quite bit changing  saturation etc  nt really opportunity look  still busy getting existing features running properly  think api supports gamma options  pretty much  able hack brightness  image rendered hmd like hud shade grey  transparent   want look adjusting video settings things need address first 
hopefully long  
source available compile    x200b  go releases    https  githubcomykearaopenvradvancedsettings  download exe installer runit accept agreement  good go 
need help maintaining project  m awesome c qt  looking code parts seem need refactoring  would nt mind relatively boring grunt work 
submit pull requests rather direct access 
game starts full screen
game starts full screen cant use desktop view via dashboard  really usefull spotify control  checking things etc
focus issues  something pops game thay runs full screen want access desktop need able gain focus back use mousecursor desktop 
thanks checking  yeah feature s still alpha need set better binding nt require juggling checkboxes   s actually possible difficulty learn control mess rotation position fly around interesting ways  nt want force mutually exclusive  think apply button going stay though  without rotation slider bar unusable vr soon touched interface rotated away  script fixed add  enter  keystrokes 
thanks ’ quite stupid  appreciate  
lol welcome club serving great refresher c  time want help sure wo nt turn help   ll dm shortly  
 mostly comes  easy use  time part  ability rapidly updatesync branches  fair nt extensively test things  make sure runs  make sure new features work  odd sideeffect probably miss releases  m really upset  means maintaining distro  likely slightly ahead releasesfeaturesfixes others 
gotcha 
vive pro audio unacceptable
vive pro  even  patched  sounds completely flat  messed huge nt want admit  800 dollars type quality unacceptable  advertised headphones would amp would stage sound quality  sound equivalent cheap pair 5 dollar ear buds  could something bad get thru qa  makes think else could bad break later  re fence  keep mind  htc done horrid job nt want admit messed royally  suggest stay clear come address fully  nt buy vive pro  audio bad  s insulting would provide bad product charge premium price   upset  ve clearly charged premium price gave faulty product 
  upset   big time  honest  happy pro far  since picture quality way better  fits pretty comfy thought would fix audio issue soon  reading  multiple posts viveport forum   https  communityviveportcomt5technicalsupportviveproaudioqualitytdp17303page3  still fixed noticed  posted well   s real setback  angers  care fact s fixed lot people  even marked thread solved  really fits way htc handled customer support past  weird reason thought  would handle things better comes product  claim targeted professional  audience ¯  ツ  ¯
really bad  s hard understand made factory state shipped  s subtly poor audio characteristic audiophile would complain  s something blatant anyone would notice  good hear firmware update  though  ll try get home  sounds like people saying improved nt  hmm 
m disappointed mic quality  high quality tiny mics like modmic 5 exist  s really acceptable terrible quality mic vive pro price hmd 
pro came today agree  headphones actually inferior ones das  nt cup ears well sound weak  mirror audio folks may want watch play  see hear games  found audio better removed included headphones ears listened pc speakers  earphones come low enough really get external auditory canal  maybe  low ears  
  unacceptable   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v07soljqyqw  appdesktop 
bs  despite pro grossly overpriced 85  sure going keep since extra resolution works well things m trying  completely unacceptable cheap sounding audio likely cause send back  odyssey s visuals actually look better pro since less godrays  odyssey nt fit right head order visual part right earphones rest ears  since pro s audio sucks bad might well go back ill fitting odyssey since earphones far ears sound  guess agree htc nt going around much longer 
 sound issue change bit  bass tone  even patched  
audio complaints seal deal buying another htc headset 
guys asking much  want headset good headphones  buy professional business x2 deluxe version 
used good quality low end wanted go cheap like rift uses  ksc75 koss

htc claiming  firmware bug  smelled like bs beginning 
reviews see pro  question  buy one   changes  s going buy htc   s good improvements  negatives definitely louder positives 
state opinion returning headset buying htc   800 big kick teeth 
sound pretty good update  s ear pieces need compress tightly ears like typical headphones  bad design maybe favors comfort sound quality  quality potential fully realized   nt believe  try hotel california acoustic version youtube press tight ear  definitely nt sound like cheap cans  yes  overtheear gear  schitt amp sound better s like comparing apples oranges 
vive pro removable headphones reason  reason  htc sell upgraded gear  guys may bitch yall gon na preorder pro audio strap  watch 
s actual complaint  like  terms audio  lacking 
watched captain america  civil war   3d  vive pro  sound fine  playing elite  dangerous really sort  d say loud  kind scratchy time   like hit frameshift drive starts accelerating sounded bit tinny   think e  prebeta patch install though 
ve yet notice problem vive pro audio quality either update  microphone hand  able clearly pickup voice  picks every little thing excruciating detail makes terrible microphone use online game 
tested update tested akg k182 song  better update still worse akg  audiofphile though sound quality like start would even notice issue
yeah shockingly bad launch  swapped usbc headphones day 1 m keen try since patch m waiting headband bought amazon arrive make sure pressed tighter ears sound much better 
picture quality better dealing  process redesigning whole headgear audio setup lenses back sucks 
800  hmd god fuck
  upset   oh m pretty pee d headphones thus far  false advertising say least  damn nt happy higher res comfort would use 30 day return policy  s annoying literally competition cut using steam tracking platform  sacrifice either visualsupport quality tracking  ready either  lg  
anyone else problems mute mic button right ear piece working  settings need changed 
look settings audio steamvr see hdmi audio option vive 
checked sample rate  vive  standard one  gets distortion run 48khz  switched 441khz problem disappears  make sure sample rate matches hmd audio interface 
issue  100  volume sounds like 70  das quality horrible 
hi  ve got problem  workaround go windows audio devices  open vive pro   properties sound enhancements   activate bass boost   settings   give 12db 80 hz  proves headphones able play normal bass level  ingame overall sound seems better  think  mostly software problem   htc  please fix asap  s unacceptable
anyone else issue left earphone audio crackle  sound cutting s short somewhere vive pro headphones 
update headset  new firmware says fixes audio issue 
worse equal original vive ’ audio 
much prosumer bs
 deleted 
could care less audio  since first version nt include audio anyway nt use headset use  guess assuming crappy headphones come easily
question  even fixed software updates  cant  das og vive made nt need headset great audio  seems like lot vive pro users break wireless headset use usbc 30 
nt vive pro  ca nt really try  anything done windows mixer  maybe adding effects whatnot improve audio  edit  want point understand probably irritates sensibilities true audiophile  wondering way improve upon bad situation lack remedy 
doubt anything fix  bet tried save costs putting really cheap drivers hoped people would notice   patching  adding equalizer much drivers crap 
first report mic quality ve heard  og vive pretty bad  s disappointing  gon na need get sorted social vr applications become bigger 
blunty good review mic difference sounded like pro s better quite resolution difference better 
earsextension thought first couple days  realised problem wearing pro wrong  sits much lower back head das  tightens forehead cheekbones  massively loosen velcro strap top originally  also loosen thumbscrew quite bit  significant improvement  headphones cover ears without full extension  also longer feels like sharp headturn move headset 
nt understand could chosen worse headphones das  completely boggles mind  could used damn phones minimum  das headphones nt audiophile grade means least seemed decent

really ca nt wait options steamvr headsets 
lol  deluxe audio upgrade  strap  da  das   399 since s  pro  clearly businesses problem throwing away money 
think s placebo honest  try  put song good bass  put hands top earphones  ll feel nothing  s low frequencies nt pushed correctly either  1  re getting enough power thru amp major design flaw left production  2  outright lied vive pro audio wise  re bad reasons 
applies og vive well 
put forth possible solution  call placebo  great 
deluxe audio strap das  found rift  das  odyssey significantly better hour trying vive pro night  least full range sound  none audiotechnica athm50s hifiman he500s gilmore lite amp  acceptable decently enjoyable way hear music play something musicrelated  vive pro sounds like logitech sat sub system sub turned  nothing far frequencies 240 hz  nt want try anything music central element  m disappointed hear fix nt really fix 
 das   das headphones much better 
firmware slightly influence sound wont improve greatly  kinda like using certain eq certain speakersheadphones  things slightly enhanced  overall 
 deleted 
s lacking bass sounds like one tinny quartz radio kits kids assemble radio shack kit barely distinguish sound   slight exaggeration  really  s lacking bass sounds worse  1 headphones dollar store  sadly s exaggeration 
lower midrange  upper bass  mid bass  low bass 
interesting  d interesting hearing headband mod works seeing pic possible 
read wrote  said   even patched 
since s headphone jack  yep 
s good news  think re referencing update op complaining 
applied eq patch  audio still flat tinny  s aggrevating claim fix clearly used poor workaround 
pro headphone jack 
comparisons posted around  s barely better og vive  really weird audio input output heavily advertised great end almost 
definitely  m youtuber  audio quality really important  pretty disappointed discovered d still need use modmic recording videos vive pro  run second audio cable pc headset pretty annoying 
mic quality 2 year old vive seems nearly perfect  chat discord lot often used mic people nt notice anything bad 
realized last night actually 
steamvr settiongs  audio  theres drop select mirror device

look username  want something like  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vzdomlejbhbg
ca nt come soon enough 
ca nt wait buy openbox vive pro 
 bullshit crap htc bolt phone dealt  including lack customer support  dont see buying vive ever  sucks decent product company good 
ca nt come soon enough 
s placebo  two channel audio uses vives usb audio chipset whereas hdmi output uses cards high definition audio output  cards audio output  significantly  better usb audio output 
athm50s lack bass using pc case s front audio  superb using back one  likewise  surface pro nt provide enough power bass  maybe vive pro digital amp  simply nt providing enough power builtin headphones  case software patch may upped mid eq compensate  suggestion change audio pc probably worth trying  official release said  powerful amplifier capable driving highimpedance headphones   wonder ohm builtin headphones  may 250ohm 
yes  das absolutely better  das audiophile grade s pretty good 
unless s voltage issue amp andor driver 
 short tying rope around head   vive pro audio mod    ingredients   1 spool coarse rope  pinch masochism  buyer s remorse stir thoroughly   s comfy  m keeping mine   yeeaah 
’ tried wearing ear headphone top seems work fairly well little clunky  real solution might 3d printing create sort clamp similar shape 
given size drivers  software problem 
s game changer  see post https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments8cc9gaforanyonestrugglingwithviveproaudiotrya  sortcontroversial
could nt tell meant firmware 
headphone jack    going able use third party headphones   besides resolution thing seems downgrade nearly every aspect yet dare charge premium call prosumer device 
think usbc port though need usbc 35mm adapter cell phones use 
 improved optics  
well might gotten lucky vive low standards  vive s mic known fairly low quality 
something else realized also audio volume  default volume really loud  hurting ears  lowering audio windows made audio sound flat  keep volume high windows lower audio game  audio came lot like das  without adjusting headstrap get pressure ears  wondering though support 3d audio  maybe decreased volume distort  ve similar problems tv cell phone mess audio low 
seriously  6 hours skyrim pro single complaint audio 
facts  think people would rather complain solution
true seems insane price hmd 
vive pro dac  deluxe audio clamp   s basically one slide clamp things use hold wood together gluing s larger htc logo  clamp shit headphones squeeze head 
 going able use third party headphones   apparently use usbc port  m sure  short plugging external usb soundcard  nt think people meant  
ha  phone   note 8  still headphone jack  come usbc 35mm adapter   nt updated firmware watched two movies vive pro  sound   amazing like sennheisers  nt absolutely terrible either 
well  standards  rest guilds  mics fine arent 
absolutely correct  also noticed huge improvement audio quality selected  vive pro multimedia audio  instead  vive pro nvidia high definition audio  source 
really  sure know audio problem 
spectavi  playing skyrim vr issue nt apparent  fact  anything high end treble decent quality think htc attempt give us high quality headphones  problem either amp driver  arizona sunshine example  crackle guns actually better s earpiercing like real gun  however  variety software use anything music heavy begin notice problem  play something like roborecall example sfx ok music far distance s hard enjoy 
agree  bunch bs complaints  ve oculus two years sound comparable  may slightly trebled 
um  first  pro use hdmi   options usb audio gone  nvidia pro audio pro premium audio specific option  sound exactly  nt think anyone appreciating attempt  s s obvious one tried  gave ways test try placebo 
usbc headphones  basically  phone industry hoping start cropping apple dropped 35mm jack still pulls record profits  everybody wants apple without actually stopping think apple actually makes work  yeah  exist  https  wwwamazoncomsmartcooltypec30headphonesinterfacedpb074519lxrrefsr16  selectronics  ieutf8  qid1523683545  sr16  keywordstypecheadphones  dpid41visdiwkl  prestsy300ql70  dpsrcsrch re good 
usbc aux adapters exist  phone came one  s dac inside handles audio  ve never used one pc though 
really great know  m hoping pro arrive next week ve worried audio issues  sounds like big part wearing right right settings  thanks tips 
ve read sounds  tinny  perhaps skyrim vr nt brought issue yet  nt listen music maybe s  maybe ab comparison  yeah  immediately disappointed 
gotcha  thanks  hrmm  well  hopefully patch works  nt switched steamvr beta yet try  
nt want disappoint anyone nt issue  wearing vive pro right   settings   wish  ve pro since 5th april release day  amp either working andor pushing driver  patch bandaid patch using eq  might sound driver issues best case scenario patched  perhaps windows side even since people reporting bad loud sound like person slamming volume everything still quiet 
midupper nt bad low end really bad  play something music  like said  eg  audioshield becomes immediately obvious 
ca nt steamvr keep audio settings straight

1000  thanks posting  makes feel better know s  getting pissed  lol 
problem think changing devices  leave vive plugged problem unplug use tv hdmi port go back redo settings 
also one myriads problems steamvr 
 really annoying 
saying days ago got downvoted abyss reddit  yes got issue  even forget vive audio sometimes  ca nt select  go windows playback device menu set straight 
simple config file persistence still elude steam vr team  problem long ve used steamvr  got better while sounds like back  hard imagine going makes persistent problem  m sure trickier know 
ve said day 1  idea nt use skypestyle priority list instead dropdown selector box  https  thoughtfulcodefileswordpresscom201008skypeaudioconfigpng way  could prioritize vive hdmi 1 vive hdmi 4  experience  based nvidia drivers initialize port  headphones  example  would nt solve base problem case  frequently changes number s identified  d easy way work around 
restart computer every time want start steamvr audio driver crash fuck  guess ’ windows problem 
gon na called fanboy  way oculus software audio sooo much better  valve copy  none issues exist 
problem since forever   gave settings stick set manually every time start steamvr
wow   every bloody update
yes 
yeah fiddle one many times bought deluxe audio headset  problem gone 
often start steam screen tv  using android tv   funniest part started screen vrchat  microphone android tv remote primary microphone vrchat
 watching porn ten minutes think may watching wrong type takes long
problem  totally annoying 
issue found actual windows audio settings particular hardware preferences headphones etc deleted  afterwards apps work properly micheadset
got used setting correct audio device steam home using advance vr settings starting game 
’ seen nat brown comment apparently ’ mostly windows audio device api absolute crock shit  edit  hey  ’ shoot messenger
literally nt touched audio year 
never issues  audio settings changing pc steam set using defaults  
gay audio settings  s anything wrong 
maybe find settings file steam set readonly properties 
dunno  issue even audio settings correctly assigned mirrored  start bigscreen launch games  like overload  example  sound wo nt pushed headset  started happening hopefully s weird shit beta  edit  reddit  fickle thing  nt 
ve issues  seems related win10 steamvr 
glorious windows 10 updates   anyway  trash settings every time restart steamvr get new update 
think depends audio devices enabled start vivevive pro  external audio interface use main soundcard  turned plug vive  steamvr switch correct devices  vive speakers mic   forget turn audio interface though plugged vive  wo nt switch correctly  ve gotten used pulling sound settings turning vr  takes like 5 seconds make sure vive speakers vive mic selected primary sound devices 
ve issues  m pretty sure s windows 10 thing  update recently  m vr meeting  rumii   https  wwwrumiinet   sometimes windows randomly mute mic 
’ similar problems periodically since start  ’ guess ’ anything happens make audio device momentarily disappear  eg  updating drivers   steamvr swaps another option forgets  could wrong 
re disturbing neighbor  use headphones privacy home    anyway  assign audio devices computer switches opening closing steamvr  might advanced settings thing  cant check right  edit  talking porn guys  jeez 
may something  also assumed due occassional steam update overwriting settings 
s official api switching default audio devices  reverse engineered efforts  though   way steamvr stores audio devices switch looks like   00000000000    3823a731a95548548b95ffeb183014a2    would nt surprised scenarios guid changes windows update  valve could add additional heuristics based device name though  would probably help cases  vive hdmi  s number  latency   attached changes  
yup  windows update came fucked everything right  everything manually
nt know s even  seems happen random open steamvr  sometimes settings stick  times nt  always loses s bluetooth connection base stations  m thinking buying little onoff extension cable switches base stations since hope steam s cranky bluetooth driver working day  unplug wall nt run 247 
seems vive pro  update related  power repower switch box via button front even get sound  even switch sound settings back correctly  took forever even find solution least works 
 even sometimes set properly ca nt get audio vive headphones  occasionally reboot computer fix  ve also problems day one  particularly mirroring  part fairly recent development ve also experienced  primary audio device set correctly  never changed  somehow stopped working trying get mirror device working  rebooting fixed 
explain
unresponsive steamvr invr menu one  try browse downwards flings upwards pulled screen bit  many things
nice idea  really wish d put skype business  lync  client  s4b actually worse steam vr forcing select audio sources nearly every call  even proper named list select  s  custom device  hope best  
 gon na called fanboy  way oculus software audio sooo much better  yes  talks windows gets direct connection rift headphones  though configurable oculus home  re using headphones   passes connection gamef also means windows audio setting nt affect volume vr   valve copy  none issues exist  afaik s openxr 
re going called fanboy anywhere one 
steamvr one trouble  oculus handles flawlessly default changing  oh going speakers  bullshit
dude new windows sound settings garbage last big update 
headphones provide positional audio mapped vr whereas speakers provide positional audio reflected refracted room ruining spatial awareness
think skimmed part op said settings constantly overwritten  similar problem  though windows ignoring settings instead resetting overwriting
 deleted 
ddi nt make windows update  windows 7 audio settings reset recently  ca nt remember  nt use steamvr often  highly suspect steam steamvr updates 
correct  guids actually driverprovided guids specific audio device  change whenever update drivers  particularly graphics drivers   audio hdmi actually dealt using hd audio drivers come gpu drivers 
must joking  s insane must true  s miracle shit even accidentally works correctly every 
windows 10 thing right 
nonstandard inputdevices controllers  like steering wheel  hotas  joystick  etc   connected  yes  try disconnecting solves problem 
talking watching porn headphones unintentionally come speakers full volume  saying  s house  turn speakers ditch headphones 
""
seems people issues recent windows updates  stagger reason  might explain seemed like question someone unfamiliar settings 
disturbing neighbor considered dick move 
nt restart steamvr  long re game  switch audio fine 
guid may wrong thing match  perhaps device name would better choice 
experience s big piece software development  especially undocumented features  try stuff till works  ship hope nothing else breaks 
nope  unless extra wireless keyboard dongle  main keyboard  wireless mouse counts  thanks tip though
saying re using vr never want use anything headphones suggesting remove equation solve misconfigured steamvr settings bit nonstarter
yea especially porn noise  live apartment  friggin mortifying

know inside headset might  happen link issue discussed  moment thought heard rattle headset  could nt reproduce sound light shaking  find screw flashlight hunting around hmd  s somehow main enclosure  d rather open  understanding s chance mess calibration tracking 
feel like  obviously within range  us  moderate  users going run problem sooner later  approximately normal  usage  s kind frustrating know straps year old  htc gear design flaws 
s separate issue  op talking headphone screws  attachment headstrap 
yeah hope op ordered t6 50 pack screws 
 dont use loctite thread lock similar  make surrounding plastic brittle
use tip screw  little required  supposed drown thread 
rubber gasket around screw fell point broke  still tightened screw yeah  loose  important replace rubber gasket 
assume issue lost right  nt actually break

4 years later guys still right buy oox40mm screwdriver 5 bux done love frankenquest 2
thanks advice  look 
iirc  manual clearly labels extra screws  unrelated vive pre 
m also 1 hour o orlando ftw 
sounds like perfect use blue loctite  maybe purple could also work

’ freaking man 
nt believe s torx head screw  screws arrived  labelled phillips head  also labelled phillips head htc s diagram  tightened fine phillips  size 00  driver    also mean original screw  one nt fall   suppose s possible htc might used different included screws different straps  label phillips head earphone removal instructions 
 one threads   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments75emoxpsapreventativemeasureforusersofdeluxe  several months ago  seems like might something clips sides das hmd

got ta get right stuff  s loctite blue made specifically plastics 
rubber mainly protect plastic damaged screw  make sure nt overtighten screw check s still time time would nt worry much 
yup  product description says  among others  phillips 0  00 000 ll one correct tiny one two even tinier ones  somehow looking spend  20 instead  10  personally eye  ifixit essentials kit   https  wwwamazoncomifixitif1453482essentialelectronicstoolkitdpb01mrnifr6  
yeah  might right  thought remember reading s quick google search  sounds like pre adapter sold separately
sadly  m hour south tampa 
loctite 222 threadlock makes plastic brittle  even loctite 425 really suitable  since meant close screw heads polymer screws tamper proof  suitable threadlock plastic  use elmers loctite super glue instead  little bit

oh right  yeah ve got  read headphone headstrap title post since typical problem das torx screws falling swivel mount hmd  sorry thanks psa  never even thought headphone screws 
seriously consider pay usd 40 tiny  spit sized bottle special loctite 425 use polymers blue colored cyanoacrylate glue 
pre adapter free  request htc would mail 
ooo love sarasota 😏
425 superglue based equally suitable  although get cheapo superglue would also job 
nt think claim logically sound  would nt torx head screw thread diameter length fit well phillips head screw   buying torx head screw fits nt prove originals nt phillips head   htc document   https  wwwvivecomcasupportvivecategoryhowtoremovingtheearphonesfromthestraphtml  indicating original screws phillips head   screw name  phillips pan head screw     evidence phillips head screw original  belief type replacement head nt matter  available  could match driver prefer  
worries  given responses  looks like headphone screws loosening might unfortunately also typical problem straps age usage conditions 
might uwthlee enthusiast level  better   chemical knowledge saves money  less confrontational advice  know proper generic substances source  nt judgemental towards people nt background knowledge  ie  save people money without implied chastisement wasting first place 
ah  ok 
425 ridiculously expensive

ouch  rabbit hole  m glad torx bit worked  nt mean scaring people believing strip existing phillips head screw using phillips driver  ¯  ツ  ¯ edit  misread post bought torx screw  bit  maybe correct advice people verify screw head  htc document probably correct

similar issue resolved reenabling audio devices device manager disabled  though nt know resolved issue  suspect may driver conflict nvidia s audio driver displayport output

anyone issues two different audio devices vive switch sometimes 
edit  wow think would blow much  definitely alone lol  surprised nt seen come  suggestions m gon na try get chance  nt get play much want   ll edit results  ve kinda dealing  s really annoying figured d see anyone else experienced  vive setup via default cables  using hdmi gtx 1070   two audio devices playback list sound settings  sure normal    speakers  htc vive    htcvive nvidia high definition audio  hdmi    boot vive goes steamvr home  sometimes audio  times wo nt  default audio device either vive speakers  hdmi  anytime nt audio switch one  ve idea audio randomly work one know permanently get working one device nt switch almost every time boot vive  ideas would appreciated 
 deleted 
issue  ’ annoying  seems like id changes often  possibly reboot   steamvr  audio  mirror settings apparently rely ephemeral id  ’ windows 10  might also 
steamvr settings set audio device used steamvr running running 
use program called audioswitch switch audio devices hotkey  s solution problem  makes lot less annoying 
yes  feel like m constantly fighting audio settings windows 
right click hdmi one disable defaults headset speakers 
windows 10 audio controls totally unreliable  set nt change anything s fine  bit tweaking  god forbid switch one source output another whole thing goes hell  worse  nt really make much sense s going  d try outline problems  d either write thesis create 30 minute video 
idk helps  also multiple audio sources one time like set htc vive default source  find one specifically unplug headset see source disappears  plug back  set one default  every time plug vive knows signal default  seems work ’ like headset plugged times  idk others  
yes  getting steam link work correctly vr mode sound major pain ass  half time go windows 10 sound settings set vive hdmi audio default playback devices even get appear steamvr playback devices list 
yeah  see common problem  think something vive hdmi detected reason  disconnects redetects new connection  ve issues start  easiest way fix simply go vive settings  course  desktop part  vr part  change selected audio device   change vive used   
yes  yesterday fighting vive pro   speakers  option working fine earlier day would silent d need change hdmi output  upgraded gpu 1080 1080ti updated nvidia driver latest  figured could related way 
nt exact problem  problems steamvr software remembering change audio devices  seems forgets mirror audio tv every single time  randomly reset microphone correct default microphone  minor annoyances  wanted make easier d something like  ikkus   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments8pz0vqanyonehaveissueswithtwodifferentaudioe0fbqms   hotkey set change audio devices playing vr  least d quick key press 
always fucks  clicking speaker icon windows taskbar changing things  restarting game  sometimes works 
yes  time  think helps start steamvr first run game second  could randomized reinforcement 
every  fucking  day 
problem  solution till
quite problem  buzzingdecreased audio quality sometimes fixed alternating sources  turns microphone feedback  vive think  causing trouble  disabled everything fine ’ perfect audio ever since 
yes  sometimes happens  steamvr settings  switch vive  hdmi  audio starting steamvr switch realtech audio exiting  works 90  time  game crashes without exiting steamvr properly  settings reset  also resets updating nvdidia drivers   second problem launch game directly  steam   wo nt switch vive audio go openvradvanced settings switch audio device manually 
issue gtx 1070 receives update nvidia  got ta switch manually next update
time ive pop running something outside steamvr  said ve able right click speaker icon windows select new audio
sometimes  jump right game  run steamvr first  launch game  s good 
pretty much time  vive software likes switch system audio vive defaults instead usb headset  plugged headset  
yep
problem  og vive vive pro  cause lot drive crash using something like discord  s kind funny high end pc system ca nt pick right microphone speaker automatically aimachine learning around  set thousand times 
issue  resigned unplugging audio devices starting vr 
yes  almost every damn time  worse also often always using steam link mirror audio tv  feel like always mess audio settings  bad enough think wife nt try use around finds frustrating deal  best success using audio tab advanced settings change devices seems actually effect  wearing headset headphones ear hear headphones tv  use menu sounds test changes  wish home environment sounds  changing current output windows audio icon notification taskbar area also worked  steamvr audio settings menu really worked well  seem effect anything immediately times  also going back starting steamvr via computer rather using controller buttons seems avoid  steamvr update running  dialog  think giving consistent audio results insofar consistently giving speakers vive work change everytime  least change works  consistently wrong least better flailing restarting vr  steam  windows 
 even though steam vr set change anything  still changes everything moment opens  even set need  always lol  content creator  really really useful feature 
every time update nvidia drivers hdmi audio device gets recreated cause steamvr forget device use something else  might causing issue 
yup mine forgetsgets wrong time obnoxious  openvr advanced settings ability easily change audio devices inside headset check every time start game 
dont get started audio devices man    uggh wan na rip hair  work like chore making sure discordobs working properly  wish could set hotkey keyboard vrnonvr modes 
problem vive pro  turn box cables goes get sound drivers appear even headset box first place  happened windows update think 
leave mine plugged times still experience issue  
yep   devices disappear resets default settings 
 win 7  problem 
yep  set either  speakers htc vive  device   htcvive hdmi  device  set one  would fine audio would work 1st time boot every time  example  ll set htc speakers steamvr settings worked issues previous day  boot vive  audio  got ta go back steamvr settings  switch vive hdmi device ll get sound  default steamvr hdmi one  ll playing night turn per normal  next time turn  sometimes boot audio nt playing even though s set htc vive hdmi device previously set  got ta go steamvr settings switch back  htc vive speakers  device get audio working  imagine  turn go back another day  might switch  m sorry sounds confusing  s hard explain really odd issue ve dealing 
nt recommend  disable speakers use hdmi possible  speakers option crushes high frequency sounds reason  sounds awful  hdmi sound 
never crossed mind try  ll give go next boot ups see solves  thanks suggestion 
using steam link vr  lag  anyone sensitive vr ever complained nassuea 
yup  got steamlink well comment pain ass regarding getting working correctly friends come life lol 
thanks m gon na check setting soon
sometimes boot games anything wrong device try switch still game  input ’ switch  try testing one actual input rename thing know  34 audio devices  pc music workstation  mine switches time  easiest solution got wireless razer man ear headphones  never switch inputs anymore 
tell mirror audio devices  s steamvr settings   way receive audio signal 
attest  always use hdmi audio option vive  especially decent headphones 
thanks ll keep mind try 
want hdmi  speakers 
misunderstand  m using vr mode steam link  option steamvr active pc vive connected  vive nt connected steam link  vr mode allows people see going re waiting turn hmd  stream user vr seeing via home networking  another tv house watch  mode already pretty fidgety audio  specify one two playback devices steamvr settings steam streaming speakers  work  seems sometimes works s set primary playback device  sometimes mirror playback device  monkey settings every time seems like steamvr forgets  session session  also make sure windows selected right audio output  sometimes nt change right one  usually keeps default speakers instead changing vive hdmi output   explanation someone guessed audio device must id changing windows 10 s direction seems likely  wish set forget  experience  figure hell going 20 minutes prior showing group friends vr embarrassing  frustrating lol 
issue time streaming steamlink tv well need mirror  wife enjoys watching  friends  etc

  edit  apparently usbc port foam near headset cable connects  thanks udecahydra usquanix pointing   went hands vive pro last friday night  showing one games running demo day australia  got decent look hardware find really bizarre omissions  namely  lack headphone jack  looked headset could nt find one  could vive rep running event  ve checked specs site well ca nt find mention either  integrated headphones removable  case want use  probably  audio quality headphones best  kinda lacking bass   nt appear way plug  re pretty much stuck using wireless headphones running another cable pc   prosumer  product really  really dumb  prosumer kind person would fancy headphones  audio technica m50x  ridiculously expensive still way better integrated ones  way use original vive seems like massive oversight  would nt bad usb port though  original vive one people used leap motion  used sound card  youtuberstreamer lack mic port vive pain used small usb soundcard avoid running extra cables  nt option vive pro either  re vr youtuberstreamer options vive pro pretty much running extra cables  getting wireless gaming headset crappy mic  getting expensive  good sounding wireless mic setup  nt know htc thinking vive  pro   also side note  new head band really comfy  fact use tightening wheel back whenever want put headset seems like would quickly become pain developing constantly switching vr pc  ca nt quickly pull headset onto forehead like original vive headband 
use vive predominantly cardio  vivenchill fans pretty much integral keeping headset free sweat  ca nt mount fans  thing useless 
auxiliary usb port something valve urged keep original vive  see happens htc designs  wireless could ve another reason  s impossible usb  probably thought s worth effort error prone  edit  looks like something  noted one responses  nt expect personally 
headphone jack big issue  want able use closedbacked headphones integrated audio  guess could get bluetooth adapter  looking forward jerry rigging solution overcome design flaw 
question  would usb c headphone adapter work  https  wwwamazoncoukheadphoneadapterconnectormicrophonedevicesdpb072fvz6gk
prosumer  nt mean people lots money  means people professional interests   imagine onboard audio added convenience highly preferable 
audio strap headphones attach vive pro

really called promac vive 
usb typec port ll need peel face cushion open compartment headset cord plugged 
well  s another nail coffin purchase my subpac needs audio feed split    suppose could split bluetooth  eugh

get wireless headphones  problem solved 
hopefully leapmotion releases usbc version cable  still use vive pro  though m sure would mount without obstructing two front cameras 
worry well since vive n chill absolutely crucial games play like 45 minutes  living desert means gets really freaking hot even air conditioning 
 got vivenchill game changer  hardly sweat playing  honestly  could see upgrading lack feature  definitely keep mind  headset expensive  issues sweat breaking hardware  think would implemented cooling solution  get offset vents  light gets still  low rpm fan get slight airflow headset  much innovation fixing previous issues  p
fair point wireless  ll see works original vive  would ve nice leave wired mode vive pro though 
delay would unacceptable  unless want spend fortune aptx setup 
works  imagine would   d really want see one bundled vive pro 
assume since normal vives offer usb audio alongside hdmi  35mm jack 
may case  vive pro definitely also advertised hardcore gamers   right product page   https  wwwvivecomusproductvivepro  says  s vr everyone  hardcore gamers  artists  families   posing dude shows jumping attack stance  major image near top shows exploding futuristic meteor  top image shows aggressive eye gaze police chase blurred environment   main trailer linked    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vdpmjdxmywiy  shows fallout vr  mentions  aaa games   follows doom 
nt forget stereo cameras  basically reduces need leapmotion vive   controllerless  applications  allows use props 
well  honestly s kind  prosumer  titan x nvidia  fact product whales  buying highend feel better  usb big minus developers business customers use kind thirdparty peripherals  s breaking compatibility existing thirdparty solutions vive  basically htc apple kind shit  signalling lock ecosystem hardware 
ca nt really call something  pro  less features  nonpro  version  name convenience  s  casual   pro   content creation  re working professional setting making content vr anything audio re going want pro headphones  integrated ones 
demo brisbane  apparently re demo s states nt know dates  availability wise  releases 5th april cost  1200 aud  also s already listed sold site 
should   ís  
use subpac wireless bluetooth dongle steamvr audio mirroring  works well 
’ right  people posting crap mad 
ve used das briefly  stretch  like pull forward bit lift face  cause vive pro nt stretch  untighten want take 
use wheel das everytime pull vive head 
leap motion nt use anything special  usb 30 microb would need like 6 inch usbc usb 30 microb  like one  https  wwwamazoncommicrobcablecreationmacbookchromebookexternaldpb012v56992refsr14  selectronics  ieutf8  qid1521576943  sr14  keywordsusbctomicrob one  https  wwwamazoncomiseekerkitchromebookelementsexpansionexternaldpb077qx8rk1refpdsbs1076  encodingutf8  pdrdib077qx8rk1  pdrdrmxwyfgzveky5jzv09vbt  pdrdwq5t7i  pdrdwg31mwq  psc1  refridmxwyfgzveky5jzv09vbt yeah  placement looks like bitch  impossible without smaller version leap motion

since reportedly usbc port m wondering using compact usb dac might another option  course  s added cost  weight  inclusion headphone jack would completely avoided   sigh

mind position usb audio dongle  s blocking two tracking receiver eyes would reduce tracking accuracy head certain angles  want keep clear field view around dimples hmd  otherwise  great idea  think m gon na try 
nt vive handy right  tough close lid usb device plugged  remember hard time putting lid back poweraudio outhdmi  ca nt imagine adding another mix
audio broken vive  mic headphone jack   ideal ugreen adapter appears mic audio  much weight add  noticeable
thought  already vivenchill taking usb port 
seems like close face would create alot popped p s  seems like would work better put lower  like around neck area upper chest   although might enough amplification  thats big issue hmds personally   def gon na use info though  thanks 
something simliar also  attached usb lav mic usb slot worked great 
anyone tried using mod mic wonder 
hmmmm bluetooth dongle 
hey  wondering sticky tack holding  m looking reproduce ve done 
bad  say  peck  sounded like said  patch  
frequency response lav sounds better without sweetening  equalizing   able achieve similar results default vive mic  vive mic needs wind screen material cover capsule nt get popsrubbing sounds p sounds  s close mouth make specific sounds push lot air  air rustling mic causing peaksclipping  take little piece foam cloth tape small hole front vive nose drastically clean audio  audio settings   enhancements tab able adjust equalizer thicken voice sounds 
s thinking  lot less cumbersome rigging body real lavalier kit
great  m hungry pickled peppers 
little tough  since s already space usb huge difference compared usual
htc make custom usb extension
long enough distance  end  usb plug audio plugs zero issue getting closed  issues mine das attached mine  thing op  went  purple panda lavalier mic   https  wwwamazoncompurplepandalavalierlapelmicrophonedpb01mski46r   stuff cable shirt needed depending m standing sitting 
sounds like need usb hub addon  
d cord flopping around turned head 
s holding pretty well  nt issues  concern easydifficult take ever need 
good advice  think windscreen material  assuming  pop filter    still needed dual noise cancelling mic s vive pro  thinking ll revisit post two months see mic quality improved new hmd 
work well  rycote micro windjammers  30 cutholestickies  6 reusable fur covers   https  wwwamazoncomgpproductb0054yjpxk   amazon 
depends  get around default vive mic sounding muffled 
go testing audio quality  way hear re saying mic 
yeah suppose could  hate clutter top headstrap already  https  imgurcomau0r0r many device hookup 1 usbport top headset 
noise cancellation stereo mics alone wo nt help much pops blow clip waveform something longer canceled   moving placement two mics sides avoid danger zone percussive wind  puh  sounds  hold finger front nose make sharp  puh  sounds vs hold finger couple inches side  feel first way second   intentionally talk side mouth steer might effect though  hopefully also small pop filters place pro  cell phone company excuse ca nt believe nt fixed revision 
materials could nt really matter  think  real difference   http  blogaudiotechnicacomaudiosolutionsquestionoftheweekwhatisthedifferencebetweenawindscreenandapopfilter  pop filter nt covering mic simply mic audio source wind screen typically covers mic completely closer proximty  guess d say learned lesson skimp mic  noise cancelling comes using multiple microphones function capsule overloaded excessive pressure  makes sense include sort pop filterwind screen inside hmd avoid happening 
windscreens ’ pop filters
remindme  2 months  vive pro pop filter check 
put tiny hole possible remove cover blocking mic  bigger opening  cover seems like best solution 
could try adding subtle compression something like voicemeter banana lot artifactingmuffled sounds due small diameter vive mic  pinhole opening  get similar sounding tone  eqing s hard add nt 
make sure didnt cover tape accidentally like lol think shape face might also something  hmd sits comfortably head gon na different  thatll big impact  kinda like microphone close face  find using earbuds best solution  becuase using headphones  makes harder hear voice clearly  impact ability speak clearly  also check make sure right bitrate selected windows sound settings 
windows voice recorder app  start program hit record put headset talk little bit  play back see sounds 
idea  however  tpcast may complicate things 
hrmmm  thanks  m convinced  ll try new mic  think vive mic badly placed 
deluxe head strap good  ear piece sit ear hear  vive mic sounds bad matter try  either gets heavy breathing  sounds muffled  neither good  way different mic case 
vive deluxe audio strap worth 
ll able start playing vr soon ve wondering spend money deluxe audio strap m sure s worth price s  someone owns deluxe audio strap tell s worth price much comfortable actually makes vive playing 
short answer  yes long answer  yessssssssssss especially big head find standard strap uncomfortable 
worth paying  100  yes  ovepriced fuck  yes  s way vive nt dangle look  also easiest way put without hassle 
stock  worth  100   necessary upgrade  yes  fuck htc  one reasons ll never recommend anyone buy vive options 
actually worth £100  debatable  would spend cash knowing  absolutely  comfort improvements  good mind blowing  quality life improvements  yes  yes yes  taking vive onoff swapping friends biggest gain perspective  fumble around looking find headphone jack great  always headphones right way around  pro still use ogdas beat saber s much bass das 
yes  default strap horrible 
certainly pros cons  balanced unit makes using much enjoyable faff around additional cables additional bulk headset  however  sound quality isnt good dedicated headset  mind bad  also adjustment knob far easier take headset og straps  sure worth  100 price admission  get one cheap  absolutely go 
worth   100  really   secondary option knowledge  default vive strap shittier  able adjust fly nice  wider average head  spring  thats used hold earmuffs wo nt work  someone designed fix 3d printed  s modifications 
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet   absouletly taking thing extremely easy good  everything nice  yes please  go buy unless little money  regrets 
comfort comparable stock strap  varies lot depending head shape   convenience godsend  builtin headphones alone made worth  also cable routed around strap comes back solidly instead stock strap cable kept riding shortening strap  s lot easier adjust size multiple people 
honest  expensive  glad bought  yes  like built headphones  easy adjusting put ontake  somewhat comfortable head shape 
buy one last week  feel regret  nt buy earlier 
short term   time  hell fucking yes  pricey improved ergonomics vive 100 fold  went able vr around hour per session able wear vive 6hr endurance race stints  absolutely worth long term investment  integrated audio nice ergonomics alone make worth 
audio strap lot easier manage demoing friends  nice pair headphones already  nt plan showing many people  would nt suggest  far quality  s good product  way s built makes worry s fragile  nt broken far  nt regret buying  bought one dad christmas 
audio quality headphones great  s nice built get pay  strap mixed bag  time s good  s painful hours means stop  normal strap never painful  amount adjusting makes perfect  fit better overall s stable face nt move much  would prefer guess says something  think try means  100 risk  oh  also nt like wires headset routed along side das instead top default  find cable resting shoulder annoying back 
yup agree  totally worth 
yes  bought vive  within day receiving  purchased das  sure  audio isnt best  certainly gets job done  let s honest  get really game  audio fine need  would argue nt playing vr right unless using das  original strap bad 
yes  night day comfort  included buds re uncomfortable  strap much much better 
100  yes  makes million times better
never felt need improve comfort  bought das seduced included audio  really concerned global comfort  ca nt go back  ca nt  included audio one thing  headstrap oh  relief  s easy put onoff  comfort  oh yeah  stop jealous psvr owner friend  buy  ca nt regret purchase 
absolutely 
payed 100 dollars happy itbest purchase  especially since got msrp brasil  considering taxes usually would way expensive  bought last importer  became 200 dollars afair 
s 100   37  worth  without doubt  m surprised sell without anymore trying 
personally find worth  audio nt amazing compared bose headset wearing previously  ease putting headset  great  honest vr games moment really feel missing using bose headset  would recommend  especially expect situations ll several people cycling using headset  ex  showing friends  family 
yes  mandatory  makes vive feel like whole new headset  price might suck d easily pay double replace essential 
og strap velcro came  almost 2 years   used duck tape probably lasted longer  already ordered das replacement  comfort built audio 
yep  fence caved  got love  standard  much comfortable almost necessity really nice 
100   37  yes 
yes
vive exactly one hour realized mistake get das beginning  regular strap  works   earbuds useless  hardly fit head  would fall slightest nod  ve got huge head probably big deal   yeah  consider das required part package save lot frustration 
yes  definitely  significantly comfortable  makes whole class games tangible possibility  hot seat games like puppet fever  instead mess adjustments 
lot people saying nt  100  buy headphones separately re paying least half decent pair  yes  would nice included  nt  s sort thing deal early adopters  deluxe audio strap makes whole thing lot less cumbersome especially great parties might switching multiple people quickly 
get discount  yes
totally  das made vr life alot easier must say 
yes  fence ages special place got makes world difference 
perfect convenience makes worth  still mod make comfortable 
nah  100   like  well enough return even  nt hurting 100   feels cheap  audio meh  fit better awesome 
problems getting headphones stay flipped properly oversized head yes s worth
absolutely  also recommend trying  frankenmod   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments8aq0pvnewdasogfrankenmod  old strap  adds even support 
never tried das  ve found putting overear headphones vive  positioned coord running center goes over top headphone strap  quite comfortable
demo device lot  walk house m going try put head vive  fine tuning adjustments different sized heads godsend 
 especially big head told 
agree  das lot better  really big improvement stock strap  however  really nt cost much  fact  default packin vive 
look far vive basically pull back strap back readjust  fixed want tight actually hurts  re saying deluxe strap solution 
man  300 headphones really would rather use
paid  50  got lightly used think rhardwareswap  honestly think  50 much fair price  said  re talking htc re   going get new das  50 
know possible take headphones das switch ones pro  ever fix audio pro 
weirdest spelling yes  seen day  yet    lol
 yes  nt even need make painfully tight anything  bit snug still comfortable
fair pro  sound really clear mids highs really lacks bass due cups pressing hard enough head  tried various software fixes using equalizers etc  3d printed springs  push harder head  dolby atmos headphones applied really helped beef sound  think way put das pro first got weeks ago  time passes  m growing like added comfort pro provides  also think das goes hearing damaging levels s entirely fair comparison  m hoping extra clarity pro turn good things relating spacial sound comes beat saber  bass always win imo 
try 3d printed part  think part good contact pro headphones actually better das  poor pressureplacement das phones better  overall think design das better simply s forgiving  
thanks reply  talking putting das pro  meant headphones  entire strap 
think  theory  possible  checked connectors perhaps splicingsoldering might needed actual mounting mechanism similar  think lot pro s audio issues processing level unsure changing cups would sound good das cups usb audio already powers  perhaps someone braver give go read 
ah gotcha  thanks information 
 work  pro using internal routing audio signal  springloaded contact pins earphone joint directly connected pros usb audio device  das basically cable dangling earcups goes vives audio jack
interesting  s unfortunate  thanks explanation
htc aware audio issue pro working firmware fix
""
expensive price beta tester  ’ wait till sort bugs drop price
hell happen professional  consumer grade  800 new hardware 
hopefully shortly mean today  waiting since day 1 pro device w bugged audio cool way defendable situation  hard enjoy favs s low end audio  ve waiting  able get immersed fav vr titles 
sadly must confirm audio pro sounds really low end    setups   hard believe
good thing audio jack case built headphones go bad  oh 
needed  tried vive pro hour saturday found sound better 75 cent walkman headphones 90s  much worse rift  das  odyssey  nt even want try anything music prime element game  glad re acknowledging case 
apparently post already deleted s another one  https  communityviveportcomt5technicalsupportviveproaudioqualitytdp17303  known software bug affecting audio setups  issue patch via update shortly  like say  setups   anyone nt got issues 
hey  meantime use hdmi audio works fine  nt happen surround sound enhancement  pissed away saturday installing uninstalling drivers full vive setup trying rectify  finally found post someone problem og vive  workaround  guess problem  s hmd usb audio irq resource conflict certain motherboards  s thing  test  happens steam vr activated  set vive pro usb audio primary audio device windows sound utility play mp3 file windows  steam vr   play fine sound like normal headphone  s playing  activate steam vr  sound turn tinfoil sounding crap  turn steam vr  sound goes back normal  order select hdmi output device  steam vr active  sound device becomes inaccessible unless headset active state  anyway  acceptable fix usb driver developed  hope helps  almost returned thing saturday  soooo pissed  m lot happier  contacted htc support friday told thought hit miss problem different computers  said nt know anything  guess needed hear complaints believed  thanks op bringing attention raising spirits hopefully short released fix 
aware pricing issue working fix 
least  everything right charging  800 
nt happen original 
s audio issue exactly besides fact audio sucks probably worse das right  bass sound thin small  raising volume makes shrill obnoxious instead filling  really driver thing something would pretty ridiculous imo 
audio working great installed revive  audio went shit played first oculus game  could coincidence went shit around time 
 deleted 
s htc  surprised 
happens hardware software vendors  stop acting like victim 
weird  wonder deleted 
s possible different depending machine  due ways different audio chipsets recognize treat audio inputoutputs attached system 
 like say  setups   anyone nt got issues  im afraid think describes  hear bass  s really meh  ll find soon enough is   polishing pitchfork anticipation 
review read earlier praised rich sounding audio  guess ’ everyone 🤷‍♂️
 hey txminer  figured fix issue  sound works correctly  turn steam vr  nvidia vive pro sound setting becomes active  switch      sometimes sound blanks altogether  keep resetting try get working  really dont know get working correctly 
 deleted 
makes say issue  fact dont want spend much  professionals tell price clearly think fine 
  2 ear plugs sounded fine  d
s want know  crackly oldcarradio sound plugged usb one older usb30 motherboard ports  wonder s issue  fixed moving add card ports instead cleared  old sandy bridge e board early usb 30 spec figured problem 
ll check  tried bass boost audio device settings  helped bit still fairly crappy  worried s software issue  headphones require lot force ears sound decent 
hopefully  software fix  htc nt applying equalizer boost low end  nt understand made mistake problems das 
fair 
 
nt pro get audio hdmi like standard  d think audio chipset system nt make difference case  could even work without sound hardware  since s passed vive  said  suppose amd nvidia hdmi drivers could affect  still sounds bit unlikely 
nothing like downvotes understanding capitalism  eh 
lol   pro  price adjusters price  pro  headset 
 m worried something ca nt fix 
look steamvr audio settings see two vive pro rlated devices  og vive  one via hdmi  called something like vive pro multimedia usb one select want able use hardware volume mute buttons  expect update actually improved driver usb device 
think standard vive uses usb audio since always disable nvidia hd audio devices device manger still get audio headset  edit  either hdmi audio usb audio  bad
like know s going   go spends  1000 two year old gpu  s
s capitalism also economics  competition implies another company needs offer supply htc lower price  another option lower demand  m certainly interested dropping £800 slight upgrade 
standard vive use either hdmi audio usb audio  depending s set 
 another option lower demand conclusion would probably get   demand better hardware  instead  price apparently high 
til  cheers
 another manufacturer brings exact product cheaper  many people would jump onto 
s high hopes pimax  deliver well new player market others react 
m excited pimax purpose showing actual hardware developers people interested high res high fov  nt suspect actually good product pimax  hope proven wrong  lot faith longterm manufacturers 
recent reduction vibration  slashing sound beat saber made devs  could steamvr  
recently logged beat saber noticed controller vibrations noticeabley reduced  also slashing sound lowered  changed mod ’ matter much personally   checked one game devs twitter   split82  told made changes vibrations  also sent old version beat saber still issue  ’ making btw  others beat saber discord subreddit also noticed reduction vibration  could steamvr ’ latest updates caused maybe  also  way increase controller vibrations manually   anyone else ’ noticed issue  please tell
exact problem  figure issue significantly reduces enjoyment game  happened last update 
ve noticed effect several updates ago  m playing oculus version ca nt relegated steamvr  testing stable branch oculus recently opted back beta 20 update ptr  issue persistent across versions  nt appear update viverift software far tell  think ve changed something unaware adverse impact vibration levels  would occasionally issues past vibration getting stuck certain hit stuck duration song  though nt happen frequently   since update reduced amount vibration  nt motor get stuck single song  believe recall talking potential fix vibration motors getting stuck  m wondering whatever changed fix nt caused vibration level drop  bottom line definitely feels less visceral  nt affected enjoyment level playing  wish could tweak stronger 
noticed thing 
found beat saber steam discussion forum   go c  users  username  appdatalocallowhyperbolic magnetismbeat saber settingscfg settingscfgbak file  delete files reset settings completly  update problem fixed issue 
s weird important vibration s always way windowsmr weak vibration slash suspect s game never seemed fun 
noticed surprisingly affects enjoyment quite significantly  thought vibration nt super important  would rattle decently loud slashing 3 blocks  basically nt vibrate  s really bad  m pretty sure s feedback slashing single block compared 3  steamvr beta noticed change 0112 update  whatever happened  really hope gets fixed 
arcade version beat saber  vibrations slash volume definitely lower regular version comparison
persists re gon na increase 
noticed well  
record  nt updated nt notice changes vibrations  doubt s steamvr related since updated 
 removed 
wmr headset vibrations worked fine  downloaded mods barely worked  uninstalled mods cleanly reinstalled game still extremely light vibrations
noticed updated beatsaver could coincidence
yeah ’ fun anymore  ’ stopped playing  hope fix comes soon
ahh s happening vive users  thanksss good know
recall exactly   stopped playing two weeks ago  fine  played update  34 days ago  noticed
ahhh thank youuuu try get back home 👌🏻👌🏻
maybe finally add option people increasedecrease much like  also people hate sound using mod remove 
  ’ even  bought new vibration coils controllers completely stopped vibrating 
 seems ask support one else acknowledges issue  hopefully gets fixed anyway 
s funny different people  hate vibrationslash would like option remove 
might coincidence noticed drop frame rate  reduced audio controller vibration right last beat saber update  forget day week exactly  ’ take note whether steamvr also happened updated 
could mistaken ’ pretty sure noticed update added “ hidden ” song  say “ hidden ” update song available immediately without unlocking bloody thing deleted saves  never modded beat sabre btw 
play beat saber every two days  believe happened last week  nt notice vibration  slashing sound obviously become weaker 
going sound vague day released patch completely broke custom music bit light panic things got sorted  think also patch added 1 new song easter egg  backlash caused release outright 
work 
yeah beat saber devs nt whole lot ve got one popular games time steam  serving massively important game vr industry  nt made changes since launch  essentially  except  one  new song  modders saved game  m starting think developers nt deserve 
 removed 
fixed  play lenovo explorer since two months ago haptic feedback feels weak  also miss lot nt feel saber 
message devs twitter  answer go twittercombeatsaber check description devs  official beat saber account also answers  people complain  ’ prioritize fixing
second  noticed change 112 update 
told ’ mess vibrations audio  weird
performance wise end s still good  even raised ss yesterday 18  gtx 1080  nt get single reprojected frame 20 minutes beat sabering  might widespread issue
happened within last week  think recent patch  maybe devs nt intend change s nonetheless bug s introduced 
nt notice difference  two settings file look relevant  volume   controllersrumbleenabled   deleting config resets volume 10 rumble true  mine originally anyways 
agree 100   already made post steam forum  point people play game modders custom songs  default songs nt enough keep game interessing  people waiting psvr version  support mods  also disappointed realize base game nt good without mods 
busy trying sell psvr
mine weak beat saber  games fine   weak games  
’ know enough technical side guess exact issue might  wonder best saver role play issue 
yeah shoulda noted 970 frame rate issue could related poor hardware
 removed 
reinstalled removed mods  change
yeah try pavlov  shoot guns see feel vibration  lab  go arrow shooting game see feel vibrations  space pirate trainer

best news ve heard year  ve critical developer abandoning development getting hired google full credit move 
https  githubcomgooglearchivesoundstagevr

might dumb question  delete files bin folder program still run 
aww  thanks  dude 
biggest complaint halting development  hoped program would turn full fledged daw  want vr daw  need one  could imagine virtual studio spaces mixers add tracks needed fly  eventually creating monster mixers  shit possibilities  hopefully someone steps adds functionality actual music producers 
looks like somebody done little bit  https  githubcommillenniummikesoundstagevrcommitsmaster
bought  nice app  kids really good time 
 development halted nearly year ago 
looks licensed apache 20 license  generally software license create derivative works  redistribute  profit  however  lawyer read license sure therefore vouch anyone tries

 played astrobot love much  watching bf play super hot awesome lol  makes feel like badass  pretty different experiences though  would personally say astrobot m biased  m super wave shooters 
astro bot rekindled raw emotion pure fun joy experienced gaming laid dormant last 20 years  give smiles per minute game psvr library  simply must play  superhot one  best move controller game also must  matter choose  going getting one greats  astro bot would recommendation even remotely enjoy platformers 
astrobot  s longer better
much depends type game prefer  astro bot universally acclaimed  good reason  much mario platformer vr  enhances lot   superhot takes advantage move controllers makes feel like re matrix  favourite astro bot  tldr  buy

samsung odyssey causing interference logitech g933 wireless  audio  headset
seem get audio interference g933 wireless headset usb cable vr headset plugged  first thought bluetooth dongle causing interference  unplugging disabling bluetooth windows  still gave interference  audio would cut seconds come back  noticed move head audio headset vr headset  faster cuts  soon unplug usb vr headset  problem goes away  suspect happening  hmd keeps sending signals looking controllers signals  even  bluetooth   would also weird  controllers work via bluetooth audio headset via wireless  way fix without unplug usb hmd disable device manager  like possible time without causing interference 
bot use harmon akg spatial sound comes odyssey 
sure maybe moving dongles  oddyssey well g933 nt experienced issues
wondering interfering void pro wireless  unplugged s crystal clear  luckily hmd usb easy enough access plug want use  use external antenna headset s bt wifi  wireless usb dongles side computers  wonder re close s causing issue  maybe help  otherwise  workaround would plug headset convenient place unplug s use  guess 
want keep headset plugged  even nt use  s sit behind desk wireless headphones  s  running wmr program  green light still blinking  still gives interference 
lenovo g933 nt issues either
s dongles though  leave bluetooth dongle disconnected still gives interferences  long usb hmd plugged pc 
put headset different usb bus
maybe power issue  tried different ports  maybe ones nt potentially powered bus 
ve trying different port hours  far seems like works  let s hope stays like  thanks 
beat saber feels laggy  audio stutters feels help

reinstall beat saber  make sure bluetooth sensors blocked one another run bluetooth device besides two controllers  looking wireless headphones   make sure area sufficient lighting less lighting leads poorer tracking  make sure reflective surfaces mirrors around play space  make sure cables properly connected pc  lenovo explorer issues playing beat saber 
using cable extensions often cause problems audio 
make sure re plugged  check power  nvidia settings  reboot  minor stuff threw loop couple times
get laptop try run nonvr display window high resolution reason  try disabling see goes away 
mean tracking lesser problem stuttering audio jitters usb headset main issue

lol non vr display windows like 320 x200

 audio jitters usb headset re using usb headset usb extension cables instead plugging standard 35mm headphones vr head mounted display  s case  try using normal pair headphones explorer see fixes issue  might usb extension cables messing soundcard usb headphones 
yes
headphones 35 mm jack
strange  sure issue  check see laptop switched integrated graphics reason running beat saber   nt know solve problem  hopefully  problem fixed soon

good audio headset fits dell visor well 
headphones slips slides falls ears alot dell visor  anyone good fitting headphones recommendation 
wear corsair void wireless headset  work well  slipping
lucidsound ls20 headset  dell fits headband nicely holds firmly  set ok mic built  comes really great boom mic inserted give excellent voice quality  sturdy well built set  available good price  manufacturer directly mind  go amazon something   two key considerations besides getting set suitable headband  firstly  get something larger 40mm drivers  lucidsound sets    large overtheear rather onear cans fit well dell  secondly  trick ls20 s pull amplified set  allows get excellent sound quality control volume easily without breaking mucking pc fiddling find slider cable s running back  get amped set  whichever brand decide buy 
koss portapros fit really well visor s band since re small  sound great  really headset though  since nt mic 
re comfortable  set inear headphones work  m using bose quietcomfort 20 s nearby  inear seat well stay 
thought bluetooth headsets affect tracking 
ok sold  use wired wireless wireless blutooth radio 
d recommend koss ksc75 op  re pair portable onear headphones highly regarded audiophile community 
issue ear cant share others demo 
nt think void bluetooth  pretty sure s 24ghz
ls20s lucidsound s wired set  every wireless set amped set   wired sets generally nt unless set buy  use 4 pole 35mm jack  ideal purposes  need charge every often amp  nt charge run use unamped fine  designed work way   ll want charged though  ll want amp  note take hours burn  oh  watch dell s cable clip nt clash ls20 s band mess fit  slide way  vr run desktop adjust windows volume headphones 100   ll control volume via headset s amp  ll want turn spatial sound well  also  turn mic  built mic fine cortana voice recognition  chat  plug excellent boom  make sure align well otherwise sound like darth vader  note cans feature hear mic well normal audio ears  great  per web site guidance need switch pc mode xbox mode get feature pc  works fine  nt choose ps4 mode though things go well wacky  instructions box nt tell  feature works nicely chat stops shouting mistake  also  since ca nt see boom mic mute light dell headset  tell mic s muted  nice big button  whole flat ear cup  mute   also note  cans one gaming sets also work well phone whilst  nt make look like oddball whilst  nt bright green  nt size coconuts leave boom home  re bling re pimp something come warm white gold  also come black aluminium need bling  white set would match dell well though 
hey   go  get

may sound stupid ’ someone make gloves vr
gloves would lights like ones rings controllers  lights allow tracking  sensors every knuckle allow gloves see fingers bent  sensors controller hand tilt  sounds really simple would allow us get even closer full vr experience  also would directly compete knuckles controllers 
leap motion good job tracking hands already  particularly taking account hardware nt initially targeted towards vr first foremost  gloves may help improve quality cases  eg  occlusion  tradeoff  wear gloves   gloves get hot sweaty  need cleaned  multiple skus made different hand sizes  slightly better finger tracking  s really worth 
kind tracking re describing would nt work great considering rings controllers reliability tracked whole controller definite rigid shape  hand bends contorts many places besides knuckles  d hard pressed find large enough area stick tracker  s even getting software support  vr games  climbey seems one taking fully physical control seriously  everyone else content using either buttons gestures  five six companies top head attempting make glove controllers  varying degrees success  want something works  works well  re dropping  3000 manus devkit   500 lighthouse sensors vive trackers  day getting synced wmr play area  s really going take time product consumer reasonably buy comes 
hard pill swallow postcontroversial opinion  m confident vr gloves described never take even tech  many people cling strongly thumb sticks  refusing adapt even touch pads  even though touch pads work well  source  steam controller enthusiast  
microsoft would support  would need standard  whos gon na manufacture complicated product small niche market  games would support  want gloves  lot work needs put something like happen noones ready yo take risks 
leap motion  camera tracking hands   cool  nt aaa games using  shame 
hands also come many sizes 
gloves supply resistance haptic feedback would ideal  feel objects  shooting games like weight controller hand trigger button  gloves need replicate feeling 
google leap motion  tracking hands problem cheaper one controller 
gloves would nt great many kinds gaming  lacking buttons  many creative applications simulators though would best possible input device  sticks provide continuous directional haptic feedback operator  self zeroing prevents unwanted input  extremely precise compared detecting fingertips track pad  sticks also avoid trackpad problem either needing pressed movement  pressed  methods registering input drawbacks sticks  outside gaming  sticks used operating vehicles drones  spacecraft  cameras equipment due reasons  trackpads really nt  gamers using free locomotion andor free rotation vr walking simulations  understandably benefits sticks may apparent  steam controller make awesome mouse emulator though  great vr assigning additional inputs control utilities like vorpx seated vr gaming  bad second stick nt included part design full compatibility mainstream games  could major hit 
steamvr s skeletal input api solves degree providing inputagnostic hand skeleton games implement  s yet another api  think vr apis providing user skeletal data  including ik processing  instead relying pergame implementations makes sense long run 
new azure kinect seems finger skeletal tracking planned used hololens v2 s probably possible ever next gen comes sensor since ll apis hl wmr hmds  big problem remains would actual game support since s new input probably wo nt much userbase justify yet small developer  s possible ever plan knuckles gets released somehow make compatible wmr api   steam api bindings 
would recommend get work windows mr headset  also checked game supports altspace vr
things  considering op mentioned competitor knuckles considering mentioned gloves described  point creative applications isnt relevant conversation  gaming context entire conversation  outside point  however still doubt gloves truly take off   far sc goes  play many games touch pads  many others  arent lot us  exist  arent disadvantage even games people swear require twin sticks play properly  fact  often find advantage given rest sc s features traditional controllers straight fail implement  m gon na argue point beyond  matter adaptation  brings back main point  gamers unwilling adapt touch pads value sticks much  never adapt anything  even touch pads provide way feedback twiddling thumb mid air hoping software correctly interpreting output value  exists virtually  thumb stick  gloves straight incompatible pretty much vr game valve compromising knuckles design vr game devs simply go  locomotion  toss stick  instead trying implement creative solutions  gloves never take vr gaming    creative stuff  vr glove beat feedback provided digital drawing tablet  flat surface people still use virtually sketch 3d anyway  music  theremin isnt popular instrument either  skilled players  like us sc power users far   simulators  yeah okay  flight sims without hotas rig  surely go well  driving sims without wheel  overall  believe firmly vr gloves mainly simple virtual menuinterface control la minority report tony stark looking hologram schematics latest invention  note doesnt manipulate stuff basic scale rotation  ai heavy lifting interpreting voice commands

lenovo explorer audio crackling
got lenovo explorer today s great  issue ve made borderline unusable  headphones plugged volume  audio low quality crackles terribly  ve tried multiple pairs earbuds headphones  ve tried swapping around usb ports  ve rebooted multiple times nothing works  d really like use  pc s desk speakers really nt immersive vr 
crackling audio typically due lack power usb  re using usb extensions  could  otherwise  may pc giving enough power  especially highpower devices plugged  powered usb hub probably best bet nt using extension 
maybe thread related  https  reddit9n6crx one person suggested changing sound format 16bit dvd quality another suggested using powered usb hub 
think 1809 messed things  used highimpedance headphones fine update  switched bluetooth  m using low impedance headphones plugged headset audio like  even set 16bit 
nt fix m getting extremely loud static  guess m stuck

confused  product looks good  fathom works kind scenario want return investment 
m surprised  previously said could least year would see product  pile titles releasing ml1 year s going generate lot conflicted reactions  s starting look like consumer product less strictly like dev kit  problem price  really  makes wonder tomorrow s  announcement going fast forward consumer availability much quicker anticipated 
think ml1 still devkit  companies collaborating ml may privy specs real consumer version ml may perform better priced reasonably compared ml1  going see new improved mobile gpuscpus next coming months aswell  tech demo though expect apps released around 2020  15 months 
kind  nt see convince sennheiser make accessory without convincing re going sell 200k units   mightttttttttt  possible re aggressive pricing    50 month something

ve heard eye projector tech real would made first release cost  50k  keep price devs offered hololens approach get tools platform  exist re coming  maybe ml2 ml3 tho  think re raising much money privately showing investors better hololens  would nt make much sense  
saying  waveguide lens looking image front eye transparent surface  focusing small image near eye  glass nt image  bounce image directly eye  nt focusing glass like truly ca nt photograph capture glass lens see seeing  unlike magic leap hololens
