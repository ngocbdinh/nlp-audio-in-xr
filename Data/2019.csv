please help  ambisonic sound working playing 360 video via skybox
using skybox organize number 360 videos  mp4  pc stream vive  many videos ambisonic sound design  view headset  play stereo sound  anyone know fix 
support ambisonic audio yet real problem advertised purchase
oculus audio spatialization sdk  free use platforms  adds geometrybased sound propagation

room dynamics updated realtime occlusion materialbased reflections  apparently performance still high enough use mobile  kind revolutionary   also still supports volumetric ambisonic sound sources   freely used steamvr even nonvr applications  though ’ somewhat less important without head tracking

nice work  guys given fixing leap motion 
best social vr app got way better  stoked 
looks amazing  cinema audio played speakers instead straight headphones  like 3d sound
wow  huge  addition lobby particular really seems like game changer  makes bigscreen feel less like tool screen sharing friends like fullblown public vr space  upcoming launch quest bringing bunch new players really see taking 
 youtube link   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v3onhkuuhmdw  ca nt play reddit video  people insist uploading vids directly reddit 
ll definitely checking  always loved program 
available psvr 
004 seconds – projections shoutout  hi jeremy norm 
impression need rt cores order utalize raytracing rt compatible vr  explain 
nt oculus go  use android tv apps though bigscreen like oculus tv app  m actually curious quest  nt think re able answer 
game reason want vr
might broken record regulars bigscreen  imagine lot new people well nt tried bigscreen awhile coming back  wanted plug vr anime society    x200b   knowledge  biggest bigscreen community  500 members  simple  provide best place people like anime come watch others bigscreen  working year community website  help us organise sessions streamers top notch  expect 1080p  smooth streaming    x200b  interested  check us  https  wwwvranimesocietycom   https  wwwvranimesocietycom 
best app vr period 
absolute legends 
rtx 
going see standard desktop support anyway
damn  really get vr headset soon 
music video s playing throughout  feels like ve heard ca nt find 
 deleted 
rtx 
thanks much working  enjoy using software  one go applications rift show people cool technology increase pixel density hmd s  seemless attaching screens theater walls campfire projection set ups fantastic technology become  keep great work look forward seeing bring technology next  cheers 
yo  seriously decent update  da real mvps 
yesssss  audio driver  yessssss movie nights back menu  great update shanks 
thanks lot    appreciate updateespecially soundbug keeps using friend  oculus go  got vive go  dell tickets  dont set price high   maybe „ grouptickets “ discountif next gen hmds arrive  could rival real theaters make sweet entry price   thx work  really nice app 
plans fix leapmotion support time  sadly
’ social app ’ people standing around 
compare vrchat  ve never tried  looks like vr chat movie screen  come close 
virtual 3d sound coming virtual positionalized speakers something re considering future update 
probably ps5  allow 
raytracing computer graphics technique around decades rtx gpus required raytracing 
m thinking screen room nt moving sort baked raytracing path rays already calculated 
s use case  usually would want watch anything vr quality tv lot better  guess social aspects nice 
nonvr  hope get experiment 2019
would nt agree  nt watch almost anymore  almost 300 hours bigscreen  quality 180360 quite  get volumetric capture  different story   find lot fun immersive
want take second appreciate straightforward answer  much better   satisfaction community top priority every effort taken assure   etc
s nothing like vr chat  less kids   p
imo biggest edge vrchat custom models  lot people anything spend time favorite characters animemovies stuff    x200b  nt like seeing kinds crazy avatars floating around messy  would better guess
yeah  s basically like  though s optimized sitting room watching screen either friends 
s got ta come  nt app  seems like one basic requirements app designed movie viewing 
would amazing could play 51 surround audio local file properly play virtual speakers 
would look horrid though using hardware cores though right  remember comparsion ray tracing done without cores quake 2 quite  blotchy    link 1   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vrlmn97x33k   link 2   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v0yyjwwsrwtg 
raytracing specifically screen light big screen  realtime 
claim realtime raytracing 
buddy watched couple movies together bigscreen  s nowhere near sharp either 4k tvs  since live hour change apart  crack open beer watch something together 
social aspect samsung odyssey image quality comfort make bigscreen 10x better oculus  vive looks fantastic headset
guess download find  p
agree vrchat custom environments avatars still top bigscreen would love see one day  bigscreen much optimised better looking vrc cinemas  nt come close  especially look things like real reflections movie  also planning adding real 3d sound cinema environments  huge  want best experience watching anything vr  bigscreen sure
hardware nt requirement  blotchiness processor nt fast enough trace enough rays frame needs displayed  m assuming far less computationally expensive quake claim works mobile  also believe rtx cards still blotchiness use ai smooth 
nope  claimed raytraced realtime reflections  rays baked probably portion canvas screen  realtime reflections would reflecting based content pixels screen  source 
maybe meant light calculated realtime  kind redundant  lol
movie thing work  one streaming see buy movies  whats business model  annoying 
fyi watch2gether website also works pretty well  may depend want watch  pretty simple use  signups required  either person pause video 
may silly question  feel substantial difference using watchtogether service  outside vr  discord together  feel vr adds experience  genuinely curious 
open beer cant drink  
m tempted get samsung odyssey worth someone og vive 
whoever room put  something  big screen  admin lock showing  something online local video file  music  like  think use big screen play pancake games  vive setup away computer keyboard  nt tried  ve watched akira latest avengers solo  fight club buddy  personally enjoy putting movie talking quiet parts  think one intentions big screen  social aspect watching movies friends  popped people s rooms  see re watching  big screen support 3d movies  one rooms popped 3d movie going  cool  hosts bandwidth could nt cope  nt know business model  know update mentioned something selling movie tickets  get money nt know 
ve tried using  issue parties file  rabbit nice since find stream things  lately s janky 
tried social vr  think would nt ask question  vr makes really feel like together people  honestly hard go back normal voice chat playing games together example  even without face tracking full body tracking  still much better see people react body language  makes lot immersive fun
try pancake vr chat ll see  nonverbal communication gestures head movement adds authenticity nt really get pure audio chat  unless maybe ve got webcams second screen discord nt
ve used rabbit big screen  use rabbit  m computer  use big screen  m couch living room  one quality big screen better  especially host  mostly immersion factor  re watching movie  friends  giant screen  interact people re watching something  really wave around  point stuff  pluses minuses  one  bit challenge drink anything else vr  m least sitting comfortable couch instead office chair 
maybe straw  haha
lol nah  long use regular glass bottle straw  re fine 
display much better well comfort  comfort subjective know many think otherwise  tracking ok compared vive  would say 35 vive 5 however play sitting pretty much better every way imo 
yup  exactly  people come vr sessions come back social aspect  watching things 10 people enjoy much 10x better alone
clarify  means  admin  adminhost room  admin bigscreen anything like 
marc andreessen  audio “ titanically important ” vr “ 1000 ” times bigger ar
""
ar vr merge imo  device kill race 
ar glasses fullscreen functionality  long battery life good throughput change world  long way go  years away anybody getting functionality ar without fanny pack ridiculous looking goggles  walk street get information everything view wo nt remember lived without  proof remember nt many years ago look public payphones call anybody outside house every car stack maps glovebox 
makes really good points  vr get form factor smaller  incorporate things like handtracking obviously standalone use insideout tracking  keep within cost console ll able market hundreds millions consumers  cheap  look sleek sexy  work box work seamlessly tons content casual consumers adopt 
ar vr basically two concepts would merge end  user preference enjoy  without vr  ar implementation worth  people call ar gimmick worth implemented right lightweight  high res vr goggle 
time equally big kind vr helmets nowadays forward facing cameras view world without taking device head combine ar elements choose whether want play ar vr games 
ar vr converge  eventually  need say one going bigger

imo hardware design limitations keep ar vr seperate long time  think s likely ar go light possible glasses  nt need occlude light high fov nt add extra weight headset  ar likely wo nt use controllers kind headset hardware inside tracking nt necessary  ar stay light possible prediction  eventually ll see first mr headset nt think ll good standalone ar vr hmd

people literally living different realities sometimes  ll different filters themes  might try someone else s lenses watch everything turn steampunk
 couple cameras real time image world headset  s software mixes needs written 
 ar sounds like clutter already overstimulated life  nt technology s fault misuse  life overstimulated exercising good judgment 
’ thinking ar top smartphones  smartwatches  laptops  etc  reality  ar replace separate devices single coherent  continuous digital experience  ’ ready  ar dominate pretty much aspects modern life 
ar seems likely become popular vr consumer uses gaming  ar glasses could replace smart phones properly minaturized keeping motion controls  imagine able read texts ar hud  able summon virtual tablet gesture  vr seems limited currently s mostly gaming platform consumet market  gaming become pretty mainstream s still hobby  smartphone arguably necessity majority people developed nations 
honestly  way see ar trumping vr foveated rendering eye becomes mainstream  might see ar professional applications like design  public ar  afforadable  comfortable  easy using watch per say   give us piece tech carry everywhere like phone  awhile 
think immersive ar plugging stereoscopic cameras vr headset long way  time  nt think technology ready anything gimmick mount pair cameras come close matching responsiveness human eye   nobody s going want wear one fairly short time  meanwhile  ar overlays top real world valuable improvement existing ui technology  people probably want day  like carrying smartphone  expect ar vr develop separately long time merge ll designed different usecases ar technology gets point s really useful 
 lot people keep making claim ar bigger vr   fundamental reason actual reality always interestingimportantvaluable virtual reality  augmented reality helps interact world around  virtual reality removes real world

re using oculusspatializer  assign material properties influence propagation audio  presets different materials  s pretty cool stuff  also audio occlusion set  seems based raycasting something  expert  feels little onoff 
build googleblocks  materials substance painter 
aureal  s name ve heard long time  long time   star wars theme 
oh wow  good 
yes  might 
ll probably use itchio  direct download  m working larger project would like release platforms like oculus store  nt done far 
upvote 
yes  osp great  m glad hear re still working away improve  confirm ve fixed diffraction issue sound occluded  raycasting nt perfect audio sound behaves like liquid light  reflections generated ray system nt quite accurate  good dynamic geometry though  ve playing microsoft s project acoustics  system uses full wave solution calculate correct physics detailed geometry  however  uses bake scene nt work well dynamic geometry 
blame creative labs us things like standard today  sued aureal ground kill a3d  ve lamenting s loss long time  hurt even vista killed hardware 3d audio outside openal  m glad vr finally giving us reason make audio priority 
 diffraction sure diffraction issue  occlusion seems work well feels bit binary  think indirect audio comes reflections reverberations used reflections  reverberations cause kind smearing heavy chorus effect times  still figuring  better options spatial audio unity d love know 
yeah  miss    took long time threw old a3d card  cursed creative every morning woke  recall  part made aureal amazing founders previously worked nasa positional audio simulations 
based huygens–fresnel principle  simply  hear sound partially obstructed sort bends around object hits ear  different frequencies diffract differently around objects corners

since announced  builtin audio like many reasons  definitely personal opinion love able choose headphones use vr  like active games throw earbuds fine sitting experiencesskyrim stuff wear nice headphones give surround sound   plus ever want integrated setup  vive deluxe audio strap musthave hear   edit  probably nt used phrase  surround sound   meant overear even onear headphones much larger soundstage  making games like skyrim pavlov feel  open  realistic   m really tryna say s anything inherently wrong rift s audio solution  nt like personal reasons 
bought defective rift units affected customers buy new ones

headphones cover ears give surround sound  gaming cans say box give 71 surround marketing worked

fair  rift headphones give surround sound 
wow mighty nice 
ah explains first part 
yeah  man  community guy ever since discovered hard way ca nt keep public loop details big consumer projects  s even worse since got politics briefly 
article definitely points lot hypocrisy within media towards luckey  also reaffirms iswas trump supporter willing donate thousands inflammatory  troll  groups support campaign  luckey still lied customers former fans pricing  dates  personal philosophy  oculus still anticonsumer vr platform

mean  yeah  literally comparing inear vs overear comment  thank implying m lazy consumer providing opinion  besides  one  gaming headset  supports atmosdsx pretty amazing cs  go similar games  daily driver pair sennheiser hd558s 
 headphones removable cord  buy long enough cord reach computer  tether cord oculus one  vive  plug headset  plug headphones whatever want excess cords  usually run small amount excess back shirt use little clip attach back headset 
fair  stereo headphones give  surround sound  
inear budspods though 
pretty upset found launch price considerably higher  around 250  number shipped xbox controller instead actual touch controllers  upset enough couple weeks owning rift  sold bought vive instead  say least fb seems working hard keep dropping price rift s getting close original number includes oculus touch    x200b  m still pretty hesitant buy anything company though 
think hands tied lot decisions facebook oculus sold  yea s still douche supporting groups 
 oculus still anticonsumer vr platform  explain little  oculus go allows sideloading nt locked  oculus rift works steam viveport fine 
nt say thought funny 
took joke  original person making america great 
insinuating  many people fall shit  ca nt help people talk  surround sound  headphones  nt help m audio nut  either  sennheiser makes nice headphones  ve eyeballing massdrop hd6xx s awhile  daily s either akg k7xx s dt770 s  depending m open closed back mood  regardless totally board integrated solutions hmd s  love nice headphones  really nt like weight nice cans head m already wearing vr headset 
ayy hd 599s love death  got amp eventually well worth money
buy 1  aux cord amazon  s used use got das  worked great viveheadphones 
 headphones removable cord  buy long enough cord reach computer  tether cord oculus one  curiosity  removable cord   familiar minijack extension cables 
technically get surround stereo headphones  depends software generates sound tuned  hrtf tuned  say overtheear headphones use earbuds  ll still hear surround  wo nt well separated hrtf tuned  since rifts come one type headphone  rift devs tune hrtf give best bang buck essentially  ll still work ok headphones  opposite also true  get namebrand surround headphones 2 speakers  use rift headphones instead  though surround headphone manufacturers specifically make software check s outputting specifically headphones disable hrtf otherwise 
yes
 feel lucky waited long jump  got vive pretty soon price dropped  500  felt fair  especially early adopters spend way worse product  early days though  oculus hype  price announcements  controller stuff  camera setup  seemed lackluster competitors started show alternatives 
350  said price 350  ballpark 1500  ballpark true  worded badly  would nt say lied 
yeah imagine spoke soon lot things  s large enough mistake eyes d hold accountable  price making thing clearly ballooned went small niche market new global industry  original tech used get original prices likely way worse eventually got cv  selling facebook great personal financial move boy sure ensure competitors would receive limelight praise 
sold company company knew would  nt buy second nt realize exactly way would go  facebook notorious anticonsumer practices 
steam viveport allow rift platforms  oculus natively allow vive wmr  luckily incredible developers come ways trick oculus software thinking using rift 
yooo s wassup  wanted 598ses think really wan na stick open backs  amp get 
tbh slipped mind  yeah 35mm extension cord would work  buying one  tethering oculus cord snugly  losing audio port computer  would prefer simpler  compact solution like vive  nt even compromise anything  s convenient 
sorry  clarified another comment nt asking surround comment  nt used term surround sound anyway  meant talk soundstage difference closed  tight sound earbuds vs open kinda reverby sound say  558s  like option without spend go great lengths get secondary cord solution going 
talking  s literally place plug earbuds rift  official rift ones 50 bucks speakers arguably worse ones come headset 
sorry  yeah  said 350  launched 599 without touch  touch going 199 came  early adopters would pay 800 dollars whole thing   would nt go far say lied  completely missed mark pricing opinion 
facebook time also known hands companies acquired 
oculus nt block  nt go way support third parties compare iphone game console
 oculus natively allow vive wmr  luckily incredible developers come ways trick oculus software thinking using rift  microsoft nt allow vr devices use wmr software  s workaround far know  google s daydream nt work platform either  ps vr locked currently released oculus product  oculus briefly tried stop revive working right rift came  since nt intentionally broken software like revive  even tried stop people using software created people bought oculus  fact  would nt surprised revive helped kill oculus studios   contention vr platform work equally well vr headsets  nt think s possible  steam caters headsets business model aligns selling software many people possible  s steam closest thing monopoly pc digital downloads   oculus home caters people purchased oculus hardware  difference might seem like much  s obvious use platforms one built specific device one nt  hotel nt anticonsumer nt offer room service people staying hotel  walmart across street hotel proconsumer allow hotel guests shop

ll surround sound  thought question
except oculus literally block  back 
sorry  see caused confusion  main point nt really needing surround sound feature  m trying say s huge plus vive s side able switch headphones fly reason necessary instead locked two subpar solutions 
oculus accidentally broke revive uses super naive injection method also used cheat games  nt clear cut maliciously blocking fuck  man  need quit posting damn site  keep getting blown away downvotes dumb shits like think s  disagree  button

m shocked discontinued arguably best model 
sent dm   
re sold  350 new box right though  everyone price gouging hard 
readily available butt  ca nt find anywhere
nt really know high demand  re inside reddit bubble  maybe s thousand people das mod  maybe even less   certainly worth keep producing months 
 stop selling something s high demand  htc probably position cant life depended make good business decision

week m  probably  going buy vive deluxe audio headstrap new  making right decision 
want vr headset outsidein tracking ca nt afford index vive seems like right call ve heard stories easily vives defects break m uncomfortable buying used  new vive das costs  sweden  around 800     x200b  worth buying new security  return store  worth going used  withoutbuying new das   m scared anything breaks m luck save 3 months buy another one used try 
could recommended purchase ve already tried many headsets decided need pinpoint accuracy  rift great tracking updates  simply fault  even comparison cv1  ca nt imagine buying vive cv1 much clearer displays offer 
buying new vive hands worst value money right  one thing well  tracking   everything else  price  optics  screen clarity  controllers  customer support  among worst market  save index reconsider insideout tracking  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v2ax2q6zpevo
definitely worst value money vr right dude  outdated hardware simultaneously overpriced  headsets worth looking odyssey  250 re cockpit games  rift  400  index  1000 rift index give  far  better experience vive every manner  think vive would worth snag one  250 
clarify  lighthouse tracking also inside 
 want vr headset outsidein tracking  suspect ve heard horror stories comes insideout tracking  inb4 somebody tells us lighthouse tracking fact insideout yaddayadda   especially rift really good  first hand experience  vive significantly worse many ways      expensive  hard time recommending anyone 
u good pc possible set aa higher vive thanks oled everything looks great  og vive index  usable  good luck choice 
sounds like ve done research  someone vive  das  think re making right choice 
 buy index  say vivedas owner 
 want vr headset outsidein tracking ca nt afford index  yup  makes vivedas great choice  vive pro would ok overpriced  ’ getting better value vive  ’ speak newused thing expect lower price secondhand headset make missing warranty

odyssey  299   250  think original odyssey sale  250  m sure hmd even available anymore  thought samsung stopped making

bad  referring external tracking sensors instead cameras headset 
first hand experiance rift  ve seen videos though demonstrating tracking  biggest issue nt want shitty tracking things like able put hand behind back offputting  ve also read people problems running rift steam vr    x200b  ve experianced shitty tracking vr bunch hassle psmoveserviceriftcat s biggest reason want vive  tracking much better s hassle steam vr concider

people always say oculus mic sounds better yeti 
realized rift s microphone probably defective  sounds really muffled  like talking plastic cup  despite whatever settingsprograms use  thought normal whole time  headset launch s probably waaay late replace

use voicemeeter output audio  change settings least latency  plus equalize channels separately 
notice playing beat sabre  timing everything  listened mirror audio s  slightly sync  block listen headphones  constant  low rumbling bass m sure ll fine mirrored  
even better  look subpac 
m sure exactly would work pc set amps high passover filter  hpf  low passover filter  lpf   filter basically stops signals coming  ie   lpf allow low tones like bass  hpf allow mid high tones  think way would digitally output pc stereo receiveramp multiple channels  put lpf one channels hook sub one  put hpf separate channel hook headphones one  someone else suggested subpac  bought one couple years back wanting one many years prior  bought s2 model  basically flatish panel strap chair something hard back  works great limited sessions let tell  repeated use hurt back  panel 12in thick ca nt sit comfortably without small lower back shoulders little know support  ca nt use super cushiony chair either needs hard backing drive  transducers unit drive back need foundation  push  give proper bump   despite said  probably best bet multichannel aspects discussed built subpac simple way  connect audio unit  via 35mm wire bluetooth   unit automatically splits signal  nt use lpf hpf  instead  gives full spectrum sound headphones also picking low tones unit 
experience  using mirror introduces noticeable audio delay mirrored output 
would real proper way  get rid timing issues urustygb said  wo nt unplug speakers sub outputting  make eq filter 
s even  slightly   delay notable  especially rhythm game like beat saber
may depend sub using  use sub beatsaber works like charm
cheap butt kickers amazon 15 bucks
true  games like audica adjust delay make audio sync  nt think games option unless would impact actual gameplay like rhythm based games 
yeah lower higher frequencies subwoofer works speakers  using butt kickers want use headphones
s always little behind unfortunately  matter setup  e  lol thanks downvotes instead actually discussing guys

nah nt  tried mirroring several different usb dacs ranging £20 crappy ones £300 high end ones play  frame perfect   2 frame timing windows perfect score  rhythm games outside vr  onboard audio across 3 different motherboards  s likely issue steam vr handles audio processing nothing hardware use  d quite hard measure latency exactly since ca nt really think many vr games require precision timing  audica comes mind strict  could also place vr headset next speakersheadphones re mirroring lowish volume  fire rounds h3vr something similar likely notice 50150ms delay audio compared vr headset audio  personally consider pretty ball comes inputaudiovisual delays  know nt go far internet 
mirror analog output mobo  connect buttkicker subwoofer jack  sure would latency difference usb  course use nt really matter 
ll try test  thanks  though maybe nt  could live ignorance current setup  ignorance bliss say  😂
sure latency nt introduced windows audio subsystem going dac  seems likely  compared latency analog output 
mirror creative xfi uses analog 35mm delay either  people delay using shitty digital audio 
ehhh spectators really makes difference  envision really irritated things matching exactly s happening vr m relying extra immmmmmmersssionnnn  would interesting know goes though 
yeah  turn audio enhancements always opt direct audio settings enhancement fluff m huge rhythm game player  onboard yields results audio mirroring good usb dac across x299 aorus gaming 9  aorus z370  sabertooth something  whatever platform 3930k   bothered enough check setup software quirk

 steamvr select appropriate input output audio devices active headset startup  upon exit  steamvr restore audio devices previous state  radical concept  took three half fucking years  bet s still halffixed 
mean index audio actually turn headset  dream come true

mirrored audio without almost secondlong lag 
nt already thing 
hope fixed issue audio mirror using volume level headset instead using full volume game  issue beta 
update broken used work mostly fine  ie  switched audio default device vive steamvr running vice versa   manually select vive audio output sound control panel 
hell manage keep many different announcements  less 5 minutes posted steam posted 
since update 1819 using gamepad navigate thru vr overlaycompositor  like switching settings virtual desktop overlay  sitting experience  also vr controllers use  using vr simracing   convenient turn vr overlay  compositor   mapped button  switch focus  main window lower part  power settings  volume bar also various overlays switch  settings  desktop  virtual desktop  steam     toggle overlay  button works   switch focus  nt  basically renders whole overlay completely unusable  used mainly control desktop without need put hmd  also button vive pro hmd work  volume updown  mute microphone  system button   mention release notes remapping  simply work action  hint  spend like 3 hours messing controller mapping  steam vr   devices   controller settings  progress 
update broke “ steam vr ” desktop window shows headset controllers  window nowhere found  without access display mirror  settings  setup playspace awful  actual vr working  desktop window

developer please see thread regarding huge aliasing issue many people version 18  game breaking issue ruining games  https  wwwredditcomrwindowsmrcommentse10gurpreviousblurinessissuehasreturnedsteam
sorry update untested total crap actually breaks onboard audio vive pro hmd  replacing digital glitching  ve done extensive testing two different laptops  asus alienware  using vive pro  one  asus  even older steamvr version  16  running perfectly fine  install vivepro drivers  included updating steamvr latest 18 got digital glitching  s sample rate bit depth based  happens obviously audio transients  ll noticeable something like dialogue audio attacks releases lot  theres digital whine sounds bit like buffer feedback rises pitch attack lowers pitch decay  threshold reached sound stable  almost sounds like s feeding enough power usb port power headset audio properly  m certain  done driver switching setting different sample rates  setting sample rates changes timbre glitching somewhat still nt eliminate  nt tried vive original since update  ll update thread affects older vives well  meanwhile would really love way roll back 16 version previously  advice links appreciated 
yay  instead open sound settings   change defaults  open sound settings time vr 
steam audio issues reason stopped playing vr games month got vr  maybe get back 
ll believe see 
took three half years someone steamvr s team finally address problem  s almost nobody writes issues goals people actually tackle problems mentioned instead left whether someone cleaning desk finds postit note somewhere dawns hey maybe fix 
confused  steamvr settings always  nt always work perfectly  course  s 
 deleted 
open vr advanced settings installed easily able fix audio nt needed long time  ymmv
oculus runtime even better  rather mess system settings  maintains completely separate setting controls audio devices vr apps use  one person playing vr another person watches youtube video computer neither audio stream interferes unless turn mirroring

using speakers monitor

 oculus runtime even better  well yeah  s really important facebook get right listening devices 
used steamvr shocked first used oculus software  works much better steam  instead drag scroll use thumb sticks  desktop view opens instantly works well  invr keyboard great use  interface smooth fast  quest similar 
almost certainly  yeah  expect wmr replaced whatever vr kit make next xbox  similar xinput replaced directinput  meanwhile re still  200  sale  fully functional vr systems far better screen clarity rift vive

thank 😊
seems update s yet steam 
im soooo hyped    
ahhh  excited try  thanks devs 
vr nonvr friends hang together way vrchat 
great  srsly  let s get google play support use gear vr google daydream 
many people room 
name still  beta  
3rd person camera function recording purposes 
way rotate displays  third monitor s rotated 90deg  portrait  shows unrotated game  know used work expected ago least 
instant crashing joining someone joins room  emailed outputlog txts 
chance option keep desktop window popping view everytime join channel update  really annoying close window every time 
remembered time bigscreen required windows 8 minimum  according steam page  s case anymore  wonder changed  win7 owner  thank  m gon na get  hope communities language  english  
plan adding desktop mode  like vrchat  would nice could use stream videos friends  even nt vr 
nt require rtx cards  raytracing old graphics rendering technique many use cases   latest implementation uses raytracing techniques stochastic sampling blue noise dithering  casts rays light big screen realistically environment  performance good enabling mobile vr headsets    x200b 
like shanks said  nt use rtx  raytracing around long time s invention nvidia  amount raytracing need seems low even phones devices like oculus go  probably would nt worth development hours make utilize rtx  performance gains losses rtx card
ho boy app staple vr  ’ required basically 
nope  s unrelated rtx gpus
like shanks said  nt use rtx  raytracing around long time s invention nvidia  amount raytracing need seems low even phones devices like oculus go  probably would nt worth development hours make utilize rtx  performance gains losses rtx card
daydream support planned right  maybe future 
got released one two afters posted comment  check 
nt support nonvr usage yet  maybe future 
already use bigscreen gearvr actually  galaxy s7 higher   performance increased well  help well  also daydream headset m afraid re loud minority   personally also htc vive use time never touch daydream cause find uncomfortable locked enough faceeyes  even released bigscreen daydream  would still small userbase  d continue use vive 
115 people based room type
explained blogpost  s still 100  stable   probably summer  ll release 10
position selfie stick frame shot videos
yes  click camera tool try different buttons allow different perspectives  including moving cameras 
fixed  let know still happening 
could clarify issue  think might still issue today
nt say rtx  said direct rt  microsoft s direct x interface hardware accelerated ray tracing cards 
staples 
agree might give people reason use daydream enabled phones  🤔
long non vr players ’ made look like vr ones  non vr players like screen avatar something  flat pc players awkward stand around vr sometimes lol  weird husk like entities lol

m ya  also vive  d like play bigscreen pixel wife sit  actually 2 vives  one computer capable running unfortunately 
thanks info  definetly look forward 10
know desktop screen popup turn big screen  also pops ever enter new room user close every time  maybe option tablet turn ever need desktop view 
sorry yeah  copy pasted without editing  nt utilize hardware accelerated raytracing s limited usage probably

pavlov vr   update 20  steam audio  attachments  amp  new workshop api
""
watch new gameplay video game  pavlov looks good  hold buying long time  seems lot got improved 
amd fx processor sad news  
needs gunstock calibration
s really great update   x200b  sound awesome office hq datacenter  locate sound accurately 
die battle royal  able play gun game death match dead people  actual low user base make battle royal sustainable  nt want watch  prefer leave session 
played bit  beta week  definitely worth checking nt played game awhile  steam audio integration new effects great  better feeling guns vr ve played changes 
played longest ever  awesome update 
anyone know wo nt work fx processors specifically anymore  ca nt think single reason would nt 
much easier line headshots quickly red dot sight  got accused hacking someone within first 20 minutes playing haha
tried  great update 
specifically looks better 
s one best vr game easily s counter strike everybody loves
game perfect onward better   shit  game fun  fast paced bloody amazing price 
dude feels bad
give try turning sound settings  probably get audio glitches stuttering work 
money vr headset new cpu
piece shit
yeah ’ thing contractors miss pav since ’ used pav orientation ’ problem  really used contractors gunstock settings make feel exactly like pav 
weird downvote  valid request mind
steam audio stuff uses quite lot cpu power etc testing worked poorly fx processors  game still playable sound stutter cut  many people still works fine turn soundquality etc options 
well  update big one changed way weapons handled  way inventory worked  way sprinting done greatly improved game  one seems like upgrades sound quality  adds new weapon models  adds attachments  adds modding support including support 10 players server 
idk  better besides personal preference 
’ know anyone enjoy onward  ’ slow  ui helpful maps ’ changed forever 
 deleted 
exactly easy switch  ’ need whole new motherboard use presumably 
money went headset maybe 
dick 
trying contractors  s going back 
tried first time yesterday  right update  changes made nt  everything felt super natural m curious earleir lol
joking course personal preference  onward feels “ better ” gunplay game style much intentional  game also paced way social aspects course real good vr  hmd become onward device 
major update every month  changed  respawn game mode  like game doubt changes change  another big update weeks give another try  course ’ ok like  everyone
nt need pirated copy win10  use unlicensed 
well new ram  s upgrade ve wanted since ryzen released m waiting cash
siding point  get headset hardware nt ready 
eat 😋
inventory used clunkier  smaller targets inconsistent rules interaction  overhaul changed simpler two shoulder two sides model also made grip button always going grab something drop something  changed sprint model way onward  max speed determined angle gun towards ground  sprint lowering gun  feels natural  put away gun awkwardly tiny spot chest  way release sling  sprinting kind pain ass  recoil used random spray patterns  changed system get predictable kickback weapons learn adjust s consistent 
’ always trying new update  find updates ’ substantial  like large battlefield  think ’ lack proper game ui 5v5 huge maps get  much time  could see realism attracts people 
watermark dude  nobody likes watermarks 
fx processors  considered vrready   https  wwwforbescomsitesjasonevangelho20160210thesearethecpusamdsuggestsforbuildingvrreadypcsincluding2unreleasedones  6243384d3d3f  3 years ago  nt know current state processors well  op  bought  s totally inaccurate assume bought headset without vr ready processor  also  sound upgrade appears incompatible fx processors  nt even prevent playing update  thread silly 
nt call dirty asshole 
nt september update last year 
right  updates huge  feel considering size team impressive  make sure try new respawn game mode called uplink assault  bit downtime bigger maps  sometimes second monitor floating playing giantbomb dead  ’ bluejello see  ’ weekends 
s make go key settings   tries sell license  opened menu  rebooted  watermark gone 
well ’ good  cuz suck dick

windows reinstalls nvidia hd audio drivers last step  ll tinker bit see s  stream vr  tinkering mandatory step keep working  fix looks decent time saver 
nt using hdmi audio hmd  find sound quality much better hdmi  usb sound problems bandwidth compression  also never problem hdmi showing default audio source  happens installing new nvidia driver  system restart show stay unless new driver installed  works since 2016  vive  2018  vive pro  
thank
edit  clearly misunderstood issue  sorry confusion    x200b  here even easier work around install  openvr advanced settings   https  githubcommatzman666openvradvancedsettings  and change audio output inside vr straight steam vr overlay thing it s super convenient  longer need struggle desktop view  go vr mess around output devices  switch menu vr
hell video card installing audio drivers  nt get 
 thing wait 
disabling prevents using vive s hdmi output since s  well  disabled  also device disabled nt going stop new drivers installed  either windows user 
found day nt always work anymore either windows 10 onboard bluetooth motherboard shit bed replaced new adapter  old one still recognized windows causing occasional issues  recognized going  disabled onboard adapter device manager  everything works great  days ago pc took big windows update  reboots none bluetooth devices work anymore  go device manager sure enough update reenabled onboard adapter  finally went bios disabled  s still annoying ca nt trust windows right anymore 
ve using rainmeter skin already using switch headphones speakers 
interesting  wish d seen week ago  instead  wrote couple powershell scripts switch audio usb dacamp speakers usb wireless headphones  used powershelltoexe tool convert exe s s couple lightweight programs 
vive install advanced settings  set change automatically preferred audio output 
 windows reinstalls nvidia hd audio drivers last step  check box says delete driver software device   instead install generic drivers work properly steamvr 
nt thing  issue nvidia s driver  hdmi output nt show unless use device manager refresh devices launching steamvr 
please link current version adv settings    https  githubcomopenvradvancedsettingsopenvradvancedsettingsreleases 
hdmi ports gpus send audio 
hdmi displayport carry audio signals  design  hdmi made replace older analog transmission standards  coax  rca  component   displayport made supplement hdmi  higher bandwidth  s also royalty free 
huh  ’ know  ’ always used usb audio device kept nvidia device disabled   yeah  makes sense  thought vive link box carried vive ’ hdmi audio device separate nvidia device  ’ make sense say 
windows regularly uninstalls nvidia graphics drivers updates  infuriating  top two machines started throwing memory management bsod bad update  reinstall windows machine using windows media usb disk 
came across changed setup around  away older analog speakers ran everything tv unit  love people make simple little tools useful like 
thanks  yeah  followed instructions  however  close window reopen  scan hardware changes get generic high definition audio device installed  might help someone else
ok  also use vive output well  right  difference two 
shows open playback devices sound well  appreciate permanent fix  thanks op 
hdmi output generally better quality

wait   like  ambitious living continuation application  got wholly confused one point multiple forks nt sure one go  ll definitely check though  thanks posting 👍
 add basic media player controls truly living golden age vr  way could make desktop overlay width stick nt change every time

music  like built radiomusic player  need girlfriend constantly proposes make app like turnsignal fallout radionormal radiomusic anyone wants go project together    x200b  remember trying listen music xbox 360 gaming back day  great think got ruined time maybe  would lot better though 
  winblows defender stopping installing  virustotal 2 pingsflags installer  anyone else getting anything well 
managed get running  originally wouldnt start steamvr every time whatever reason exactly well  wondering however  push talk button mapping work  first glance impression would activate button combinations  picked grip buttondpad  however seems activate either one individually rather together  intentional  seem particularly useful current form 
short answer yes longer answer always complicated  matzman666  original creator  currently nt time projects  afaik active developers together one roof   developing missed please send dm 
assume per time restart  yea ll make issue easy fix 
roadmap provide linux support  although gurantees supported nearly like windows version 
possible  application like probably better separate app 
utilities send windows media keys  100  perfect  use pretty much app want
yea  far tell something nsis packaging  tell malicious  appears false flag  go look source choose 
well less  fixed  upcoming version  300  13 weeks probably   need push bit code  testing  switch us steamvr s 20 input system  set bindings via valve s ui  still limitations  much control give currently  watch rsteamvr rvive rvivevr post 3 ready  watch github new release  really want always test current development builds though need handle compilation things 
sounds like good time  matzman sure needs break considering making many useful tools time  maybe  surviving  awesome thing open source people pick mantle continue riding  installed look forward getting center marker back  m new system 😉 s still weird many things could steamvr nt 
whoa  thanks 
yeah  probably safe  cant help careful check  stop installing packages dont show safe read stories projects code indeed safe packaged executables werent safe source  plus mentioned nsis installers hijacked ransomware late virus companys probably bit twitchey  like run side caution bordering paranoia  seen similar issues obs plugins site regards ndi  also installer issue totally fine via archive give archive version try instead  cheers reply 
nice  long button combinations eventually possible feature totally useable  present far easy push talk dont want apps use pretty much buttons 
ironic part api steamvr like center marker literally api call  many features accessed conveniently inside vr 
standalone would rather installation steps  nt think ransomware hijacking much  used package ransomware  people running  said  nt think move away nsis packaging needs short term least  releases github  loweffort fix alleviate concerns hit us  outside think would considered fairly low priority  especially since relatively rapid releases might render many methods moot  tl  dr 1 standalone would rather install  7z  2 continue use nsis forseeable future packaging 3 fix reasonably loweffort hit us  get asap  4 otherwise honestly lowpriority issue  bit addressed 
yea button combinations possible  rather  chords  steam calls  super curious limitations etc   check binding system  http  1270018998dashboardcontrollerbindinghtml  steamvr running  controller binding interface 
indeed  making  suggestion   https  githubcommatzman666openvradvancedsettingsissues88  application one point  get custom floor markers  matzman mentioned s actually toggle switch built feature  valve could so many more things steamvr  alas  knows s going  recently submitted another feature request steamvr forums  asking features available companion applications  use floor fix regularly year tracking settled  valve refusedignored add feature steamvr even repeatedly asked forums  pshaw 
way separate audio work pc wife plays vr games 
work pc play games  sometimes wife gets urge try vr games  also need use pc work work involves audio listening websites   download audio run vlc  know separate sound  ca nt case     x200b  way 2 us use pc share sounds 
time  start vr vr sound selected   change sounds different output open window  also youtube  game headphones
 audio router   https  githubcomaudiorouterdevaudiorouter  especially helpful programsgames  follow  windows default audio device nt offer way change output device 
windows 10  click speaker bottom right click  change
use voicemeeter potato split audio different destinations  s especially handy streams without physical mixer 
windows 10 sound settings control panel select output want use source audio 
along usynkndown said  especially want separate resources  make sure s lagging   look virtual desktop allocate resources directly  including different sound hardware 
got years back  s invaluable   aster v7   https  wwwibikru  essentially s workplace tool pc  use time s one pc gf  wants watch tv  game  two monitors tv hooked  something completely separated audio inputs  interface dead simple  ll work one graphics cards  handy two dedicate one per workstation  d suggest minimum 16gig ram 4core cpu workable gamingvr 
depending websites need use  could use something like https  chromegooglecomwebstoredetailaudiopickgfhcppdamigjkficnjnhmnljljhagaha  hlen use chrome  find software forces programs change speakers use make vr lag spikes 
wait  clarify  able vr game running person using vr hears game  also watch youtube videos pc hear youtube video 
 change sounds different output   x200b  control panel   sound   playback youtube  steamvr   sound   htc vive vr    x200b  saying  two settings one pc 
ll try default windows 10 changer glitches  thanks 
got  thanks 
yep  worked
use motherboard sound  nt 2 separate sound boards 
yes  use diffrent default sound devices per application  steam vr defaults usb sound vive  chrome set default home theater via hdmi  system default set headphones regular gaming  technically could 3
believe s specifically asking one application output speakers one application output entirely different set speakers 
yeah windows audio changer great  added years ago 
re using vr console  video card handle audio output  via hdmi example 
try  thank 
yes  seems  whoa date   learned video cards since years ago also audio via hdmi  ll try  thanks 
worries  m happy help  keep mind solution would probably warranted difficulty use computer impacting performance vr experience  pc strong enough use light enough  changing audio also suggested would much easier 
lose sound 
everytime m playing sound either bugs lose completely  suggestions would greatly appreciated  vive pro well  wireless  edit  also mid game one controller loses tracking  great  help would nice thank 
use hdmi audio instead usb audio driver
make sure sound settings windows set htcvive  make changes used advanced settings mirror sound headset
check relevant connections tight 
sound fixed thank three help  get one controller fixed  put frustration 
regarding tracking  lighting room outside  glossy reflective surfaces  firmware uptodate 
sounds like re using usb audio  strain bandwidth available  particularly board usb ports  use hdmi audio  solve issues expect 
vr needs standalone vr console like roots see post like nearly everyday 
play next windows blinds fine  nt issue first 6 months pro next windows entire time m trying see anyone similar issue  dont worry keep everything sunlight especially lighthouses  everything worked fine probably 2 3 months ago yes firmware date  like really seems randomly lose tracking wont identify either  also indoor lighting near anything basestations point carpet walls 
using hdmi audio  still losing tracking controller  dont know 
yeah s sad  s one fun things ve ever done controller lose tracking every 10 minutes disappointing 
experience complicated standalone vr setup correctly  ops issues likely precisely  ops issues  vr issues  using vive one button operation 2 years 
ahhh  s frustrating  sure would related  experience thing ever caused tracking go nuts either mirror reflective surface  oddly kinect xbox one 
well everyone different experiences  m one s problems 
like saying pc gaming straight forward consoles  bs
absolutely  things go wrong  nature beast tech  guy suggesting needs standalone workable reach  perfectly straightforward  wager nt  either something wrong end  far less likely  fault somewhere  s certainly super fickle fiddly inconsistent setup  s arranged properly  ll work  simple 
realistically  intrinsically complicated  use mouse start battlefield rather controller  s simple make  yes potential pitfalls along way  know re s trivial  vive steamvr different  s setup properly  certainly wrinkles pancake gaming  say  s one button  hit button headset  go  nt really require anything beyond 
oh work  10 minutes controller loses tracking  like said  worked perfectly  one day nt work  changes end  nothing  s simple think things suggested would worked  sorry 
stated  setup properly  everyone good even knows setup properly  people want turn  accept odd update play without setup deal issue op  may easy  major reason consoles exist people want brainer way get game  love pc vr senior person  even want tune play without setup etc  sometimes  quest going deliver bring masses pc vr done despite technically better 
bought vive today  used entire day  unplugging sound channels longer provide sound 
unplugging way get sound laptop connecting vive  headset wired vive gives pc sound https  mediadiscordappnetattachments439873289825812483611267167622791179unknownpng  width480  height375 http  prntscrcomospwn1 known issue fucked  edit  got another screen sound menu http  prntscrcomosqnv6
sound dumb tried restarting pc  ’ fixed sound day  similar problem
constant issue  usually restarting pc helps  also making sure sound menu set htc vive  try completely disconnecting give plugging back make sure nt headphones pc  sometimes suddenly works nt make sense 
check steam vr settings audio  sounds like switches default audio device headset replicates speakers  setting steam vr exits probably set nothing instead switching default audio speakers  currently default audio headset nt plugged nt steam replicating audio anymore 
clicked little speaker icon selected correct audio output    x200b  right clicked little speaker icon bring mixer check see channel nt muted 
ever fix audio issues pc  know ve issues using vive  issues fixed changing default audio devices  try messing around devices defaults sound settings 
tried installing motherboard s sound drivers  may issue valve audio drivers interfering  sound menu seems pretty sparce  setting show  unplugged disabled sound devices  menu  make sure s enabled  may need right click enable device 
jup many many times
ive restarted pc nothin  everything idk  think im fucked
ive switched around plugged unplugged  headset changed steam streaming  lost original realtek audio edit  also fyi current moment screen vive unplugged settings whats supposed headset steam streaming

nope never  changing default audio absolutly nothing  restarting pc nothing  steam said vive running monitor yesterday maybe something todo  honestly sound works vive plugged  fine

way run steamvr without audio hijacked 
turn steamvr  audio set headset instead default speakers headphonesmicrophone  mirror audio  mirroring audio takes volume vr account  m 50  volume within vr  speakers hit 50  lower volume  additionally mirroring audio causes noticeable delay audio  s always lagging behind ever slightly    x200b  way isolate audio headset speakers things  oculus fine  vr games play audio headset always  always prioritise microphone headset  using steamvr games default speakers headset microphone unless set window s default headset  let steamvr    x200b  ideally d like able steamvr running without audio takenmanipulated  go settings swap audio devices every time want put headset 
yep  open settings steamvr active  alter change audio source  setting do nt change source   next time start nt repeat process 
windows normally one audio device  free 3rd party software allow route one source speakers another headset   https  wwwitechticscomrouteaudiopc   https  wwwitechticscomrouteaudiopc 
try https  wwwhowtogeekcom352787howtosetperappsoundoutputsinwindows10
nt change source makes many games vr sending audio speakers though vr headset  microphone incorrect one used  asking whether way vr applications sound isolated headset pc audio settings changed everytime vr headset  example  oculus  brother vr playing ca nt hear pc background sounds tasks  like youtube whatever   ca nt hear vr game  unless choose mirror oculus  app 
think s old build  new build nt give option  gives  vr headset     latter dropdown menu choose  s two  one audio input one audio output  bottom s one piece  mirroring  onoff toggle  dropdown menu select mirror  option steamvr fuck around shit 
basically 2 people using computer totally different things time  typical use scenario would surprised thing would get support time soon  technically switch things around using windows 10 latest editions s manually done 
sorry  trying help  guess nt really understand use case 
vr troubleshootingdevelopment requires steamvr running  even though m wearing headset  d like windows  default audio unmanipulated  also wanting steamvr s audio run vr apps exclusively  nt want either 1  turn steamvr actively using headset 2  manually swap audio devices  solutions conflict one another

fx ryzen different generations amd processors  issue appears limited fx series 
fx different line ryzen  nt tested reason nt work newer ryzen platform
ryzen works completely fine pavlov  worries dude  avoid ancient fx line cpus golden 
sounds like whatever new feature re implemented requires sse 42 extension fx line lacks  unique situation  many new games especially japanese ones problem 
set hmd mic default ur windows desktop lol
nt think ve ever performance issues workshop map  thing ever bothers janky spawning homebrew uis

mean “ pop onto pavlov  ”
huh 
loool fucking npcs  original thoughts  repeating bullshit ive dumpsteres pro players onward camping corner one occasion  shit hard son  pavlov requires much skill  cause snap aim head control recoil keep aiming head 
’ definitely everyone thats exactly love much  guy 200m might pop round corner unexpectedly means ’ always tension requires move act carefully  vr heightens everything  ’ good ol regular fun

 s wrong onward  m played seemed pretty polished last time played  heck  everyone praising onward best vr shooter last time checked  onward developed one guy think  advantages weapon attachements  maybe better weapon sounds models  updtate pavlov awesome  feels like vr 20  knuckles missing 
hahaha yes  thank  fixed

ve seen countless people rage quit onward  ca nt even see m shot   onward  positioning  reflexes means s strategy effective communication  pavlov like cs reflexes fast thinking everything  different games  different subgenres  played pros onward d slaughtered amount twitch skills would save   npc s grade 8 working ya 
complaining ttt  problem 
amd nt like intel  s new sockets every 5 years  am4 support planned another two generations cpus iirc  2020 least

first switched onward thought people must cheating could imagine people could fast accurate close quarters iron sights seemed crazy especially way recoil pavlov  new update adding attachments become lot inviting newer players help shorten learning curve 
need precise howto skipped steps
hmm  s strange ve never heard trolls jumps games screamtype spoiler shows  seems like evil troll  forexample  insert characters names say dies game thrones forexample  guess s good thing dose nt happen  surprised ve seen anybody something like 
thats quicker way muting mic windows  want talk discord playing pavlov
 example onward playerbase  bunch braindead npcs
well  ’ want amazing game mechanics option fast paced  arcade game mode felt like
’ never played onward ’ one “ sweaty ’ ” pavlov  ’ heard onward ’ pace game  pavlov fast paced  like said think ’ enemy going time  bomb  positioning still important tho  much like reflexes still relevance onward  strategy going make break teams everyone ’ damn good shot   smokes go  flash  etc  guess point games use strats  positioning  reflexes  thinking  etc  ’ timing game changes play style 
 onward  positioning  reflexes means s strategy effective communication even remotely hard  literally go find corner camp  crouch low  wait  even go water 2 maps  completely hidden  attacking  rng whether enemy looking direction  see small movement  spray area 810 times die  run aim well  likely mutual kill  ive played poopachu  pros   honestly sad easy take camp  ignoring game still runs like shit  pavlov requires positioning  watching corner always gives advantage   well aim skill  cause aim accurately head   play pros good people  start shooting  high chance get one headshoted snap aim head without even adsing  please stop pretending like onward super tactical game requires lots tactical skill play 
listed browser death match hence makes searches true dmtdm games annoying  people enjoy ttt good  find s idiotic piss usually shouting kids resist urge swear 
yeah  s exactly want hold new socket  two generations nt enough upgrade  start beginning five year cycle  ll probably buy one beginning end  way cpu development slowing  s crazy throw mother board ram small increase 
hey thanks ton  fixed went snarky asshole  3

uplink assault nt fast enough 
quite hours games find skill ceiling higher onward  maps onward  like subway  jungle  suburbia camper friendly  least favourite maps  open maps like quarantine downfall spots first   rng   coupled communicatesworks together better  better position  reflexes help nt decide firefights  might able pick pros every wo nt win match team knows re unless team well  even agreed points  communities completely different  would nt surprised average onward player ten years older average pavlov player every time play pavlov  s full kids s full kids  s hard get semiserious  game everyone wants play gun game sandbox shit  nt know pavlov onward proper competitive scene  would need high level players definitively assess highest skill ceiling  nt consider good either game always top scoreboard pavlov many damn kids rush weapons pointed 
much  server list seemed much smaller found ttt servers basically 
start match 
re still bulldozer based cpu  favour seriously consider important next socket  performance increase huge already 2000 series likely significantly better new 3000 parts launching computex  decent b450 board cheap 80   value enough use years feel bad selling years later  d understand holding eventual 5000 series  d first gen ryzen something like 2700k3770k  bulldozer chips really nt age well 
oh  ok  nt know d make choice understand logic  wanted make sure aware

 skill ceiling higher onward wrong   spots first  rng  might able pick pros every wo nt win match team s actually communicating  false  matches  nt involve new players  matter waiting someone shoot get drop  get alternating kills  pick players  basically get huge advantage   would nt surprised average onward player ten years older average pavlov player every time play pavlov true  ironically onward players bigger assholes votekick new people time   nt know pavlov onward proper competitive scene  thats cause downpour pushed hard  riding wave game popularity  instead actually fixing game  pavlov televised league play  would dwarf onward much exciting faster paced 
 s community servers made dev  workshop one s nt official one m talking

ah yeah  mostly saying option exists  think also disable mic via game settings joining match  pavlov nt good implementation muting mic game afaik

guys make steamvr 300  better experience
amazing  thank much  one suggestion  possible choose controller binding  like hittingholding left grip button example  ll make rotate 90 degrees left example  way easier constantly going play space manually rotating playspace 90 degrees  would amazing games nt support snap turning    also  s paypal let buy drink work  edit  saw  play space rotation via hotkey  lol nvm  glad s coming
good work 
experiencing bug ’ hide chaperone old version  update fix 
awesome  nt expect wake today  ever somehow get access steam keyboard api  could please allow us use  cutiekeys   https  githubcomnormalvrcutiekeys  place regular steam keyboard steam chat possible 
advanced settings mess vive wireless sometimes  coincidence wireless drops sometimes advanced settings disappeared 
awesome 
realtime controller based playspace adjustment  another repo added found invaluable development general use 
ve watching updates guys throwing excellent  didnt catch eye  today    x200b  okay time hop back advanced train lol  good job  
suggestion  allow keyboard mouse controls steamvr ui  use case  play elite il2 mostly  almost never use controllers unless tweak redraw room
motion smoothing thread title see mention 
great news  question  chaperone profiles stored  uninstall advanced settings install new version loose chaperone profiles nt back first  wondering lot playspaces saved switch depending crowded floor furniture need move vrpartys 
considerable qol features  thank much 
thank hard work 
yea  looking updated ovr advanced settings couple days ago  thanks 
dope 
see  alttab  feature m planning hijacking trigger shadowplay captures  would nice could send configurable keybinding nt overwrite existing keybinding 
chance add motion smoothing controllers  would nice steadier aim rifles certain shooters without buying stock attachment 
feature would love steamvr ability take pictures timer  like 5 3 seconds pressing button settings  dreaded combo vive wands likes working whole lot  timer general would super helpful awesome
good job  thank  possible place marker one chaperone bounderies  like  table one corners chaperone would like know know reach drink 
able call friends inside vr  voice communication vital vr  group chat would great well  vox machinea style would pretty cool
please add  asynchronous reprojection option   https  githubcommatzman666openvradvancedsettingsrawmasterdocsscreenshotssteamvrpagepng 
audio profile somewhat solves problem since  think would great improvement audio recording bar  shows audio level mic  audio section people figure audio input vive since alot stuff shows usb audio 3  usb audio 4  usb audio 5  etc 
excellent  thanks 
thanks  work makes vr much better  push talk absolutely godsend streaming beat saber  much noise bullshit microphone vive otherwise nt ordered stuff need hook mod mic yet
wireless occasionally crash sometimes power cycle unit get back  crashesrestarts advanced settings needs restarted manually  disappears menu  unless close steam vr reopen pc   known issue fix 
 add f1f12 buttons   add possibility use two keys simultaneously  example games feature reset camera  need press ctrlt something like     x200b 
 removal reprojection options favor motion smoothing mean amd users  impression steam s motion smoothing thing nt work amd cards yet 
way mic toggle  reason ca nt use button touchpad pushtotalk since dont talk much d rather toggle onoff  ve tried setting pushtotalk using right controller griptouchpad  direction   soon press grip mic unmutes  works fine grip setting  cant life figure use touchpad  would also possible control volume level directly advanced settings 
demos explanations  way get 3d overlay third controllerpuck  d make easier use third controller point buttons controller  areas game  thanks 
thank working  chance could see overrides controller angle  axis  driving insane trying deal  nt even think people aware wmr controllers flipped 180 around radial axis beat saber  throwing also broken many games due horrible base orientation totally separate visual indicator  accounting perfect example  
really could use motion cancellation feature openvrinputemulator soon  well m shocked  still seems working   https  githubcommatzman666openvrinputemulatorissues143   would nice updated part openvr advanced settings also 
want say advanced setting playspace mover used crash compositor used  oculus  longer  however still might bug since feels less smooth standalone playspace mover  less reason input emulator around  still need space calibrator using vive trackers oculus 
install home loader longer working  tried uninstall reinstall still broken  fix anyone knows   update  got load uninstalled reverified steamvr  tried  file must corrupted unpacking something 
formatting tips  use asterisks instead dashes make lists  put empty lines lists  want add line break without paragraph break put two spaces end 
since steamvr still unable handle 4k desktop correctly  displaying quarter screen   would nice could option switch resolution 1080p  either startup clicking button  
great suggestions  s clever idea work around trouble disabling chaperone  thanks 
 send altenter even better  ’ eventually hoping basically  full  keyboard vr  ’ always somehow finding need enter weird key combo ’ thought ’ need  access keys would solve issue  stickykeys option alongside “ submit ” button similar enter simultaneous keypresses would facilitate  prevent clutter  could lesser used keys like function keys even numeric keypad slideaway panels accessble clicking wellmarked arrow symbol sort  would fair amount work get frustrating able enter needed keystroke combo vr due needed keys available  “ sticky keys ” option would avoid need implementing endless new buttons represent knows many key combos  since really ’ limit  final icing cake would option controller gazebased key entry  facillitate folks accessibility needs  thank op others keeping essential utility alive  keep hoping someone might step revive point 
 send altenter  would love way automate certain fullscreen games  next best option  honestly use keys alttab multitask vr
would super useful  certain  type vr gamesapps  
method  far know   might possible using openvr input emulator force change hmd orientation  rotational change applied tracking universe  handle  yaw seems work 
best knowledge  though nt done chaperone page yet nt really looked api calls yet     x200b  know little adjust roof chaperone  might possible  nt get hopes   probably super hackish way sure worth headaches 
could setup profile thats seated orientation setup laid 
wow  nt know lazy dude also vr gamer 
ll need reinstall latest release 
pitch 
fade distance   0 hide currently 27 release 28 release logic changes chaperone bounds  next feature release 
possible yes  definitely long ways ever 
100  sure wireless works  nt  couple devs  steamvr keeps running best knowledge nt stop  steamvr stops steamvr started might autolaunch advanced settings  best guess 
yes 
ever hop  app invaluable steamvr
s misc  essentially valve release motion smoothing  removed interleaved repro  related items  understand  either 1 motion smoothing 2 asynch repro  obviously affects steamvr headsets rift etc   removed old functions  replaced motion smoothing checkbox  essentially 
appdataroamingmatzman666openvradvancedsettingsini 300 change path  nt exact path yet 30 ways away 
motion smoothing question reprojection setting  could api smooth motion tracking probably outside scope project  would far future 
room setup  advanced mode set points  make sharp little triangle points along edge table  re tracing space  d make point corner table touches playspace  reach playspace along edge table make another point come back normal boundry make another point next first one corner  continue setup usual 
 deleted 
motion smoothing asynch reprojection far tell  wrong please tell  removed keys 109 openvr 
stands asynch repro motionsmoothing  behavior think valve wants  need look bit  apparently way force repro need look  reality api calls used program nothing since 109 openvr  much really changing 
toggle mic onoff audio tab already click mic icon next volume  yes possible control volume directly  though since already dashboard  audio tab particular essentially space likely get added  side note really need adjust main volume put main speaker  mirror  set volume  switch back keep volume level 
possible api perspective yes  certainly would much longer term goal  possibly outside scope 
yea  intending  rewriting input system get legacy binds  cleanup keybinds operate  preparing knuckles 
reduced  eliminated   crashing  caused least part overzealous logging  yes currently performance playspace mover leaves lot desired  changes implemented rotation branch already  specifically  increase tick rate adv settings  50 hz  going increase 90 hz least  probably like 100120ish  possibly expose user  attempt synchronize updates  least playspace ones  compositor  spreading error detectionlogging evenly allow consistent frametimings 
home loader  mean steamvr home  click gohome button  let load  exit vr pretty much always load steamvr home 
nt seen problems displaying 4k screen  scaling  like fonts everything scaled 150  shows whole screen cursor movements nt match system says re pointing  yeah  able switch desktop resolutions fly might nice 
also alttab since altenter nt allways work  would usefull 
currently issues regarding getting rid chaperone  know valve blocked low alpha update  m fairly sure m currently running invisible chaperone  edit  scrolled saw mentioned fade distance thing  disregard 
m situation wanting get rid  barely visible  play room scale space bit  s space   playing skyrim fallout fine setup chaperone active adjusting fade distance opacity make come early  fairly dim   completely immersion breaking  also playspace always floor center showing  look make sure m drifting far center  s little awkward  works  however  brightness  particularly night game  plain annoying  able full control chaperone opacity point soon  step away vr 10 weeks ago  able get back  chaperone brightness killing  thanks
windows 10 built screen keyboard often use desktop mode  course doesnt work youre stuck full screen app cant send altenter ha
ca nt beat meat standing  nt deserve tech
would cool play rpgs laying sure 
hi say roof mean  high  ’ old app lets raise way high like low 
nt rotate game  want look game look forward  example play beatsaber lying bed 
nt underestimate laziness  many great inventions come  fuck going x get  easier way   vertically pitching chaperone would great vr movies bigscreen laying bed facing 
cheers 
yaw controlled hand  mostly manual redirected walking 
hoping includes missing hapticsound feedback features  miss 
oddest chaperone requirements  play sitting games outside play space  generally bounds vanish everything good  except persistent bounds persistent centre marker  d love way turning inside space  fade outside space  said  odd  think way could implemented would nt confusing shit  contribute code 
patient man  m happy hear 
thought something audio settings changing wireless dropped  default audio device switching one things fixed great news 
period time presented issues steam vr setup corresponded fpsvr features needed 
sweet  thanks ’ know ’ see lol since responded quickly  download install new version current one 
great thanks    
damn  guess ll buy stock 
ok  makes sense  definitely rerun setup try  thanks 
voice chat already steam  s easy way vr  need add button drop menu vr  s brainier
know someone wants disable reprojection open headset mirror type shifta  s default otherwise 
hmm  thanks reply  far know  async reprojection also nt work older amd cards like r9 390 card  option interleaved reprojection  unless m mistaken 
 toggle mic onoff audio tab already click mic icon next volume  meant game without opening menu 
nt hold back  want know truly excited hearing  among occasional clean installs  ve reevaluated need every ovr plugin except advanced settings  hear best one improved exciting  oh  axislocking great  would feel little complete able reset playspace binding  standalone playspace mover popularly function  press move buttons   
 home loader  would know  allows programs steamvr home load default 
yeah  depends  sometimes displays full screen cursor moves top left quarter  times displays part  annoys want search something playing  remove hmd go menus switch resolution 
 m fairly sure m currently running invisible chaperone  atm  differently usual  alpa chaperone didnt anymore  minimum trigger distance additional seemed make pop anymore 
hmm  never thought trying use windows keyboard  assuming could easily invoke vr  regardless whatever else screen  wonder well using vive wand laser pointers work desktop mode conjuction keyboard  might play around  generally like idea dedicated invr overlay better though think  ’ thinking someone actually built something like one point ’ going questionable memory 
s ca nt beat meat standing  matter logistics  re already wearing headset  ca nt see anything  means got ta plan ahead  got ta something  well   catch  end result  men   also spot put controller perfectly place video  something like pocket  swim mentions back pocket works well    able lay would make much easier  since remove  need pockets  variable equation  s enjoyable  self serve  situation  s matter preference 
adjust height chaperone walls  ca nt put roof  least afaik  chaperone height built currently  little buggy though one things looking 
movies bed  well bigscreen place additional screen ceiling 
asked dev bigscreen  said s vr design nono user pitch real world  used example lying saying ca nt see causing issue  would nice possible via thirdparty method 
 see potential  thought dude vr
kung fixed audio device dropping uses wireless  issue fixed 
hmm look api  particular reason would want turn asynch repro 
ca nt speak support different gpu s sorry  guess work  valve removed keys   kpchsteamvrallowasyncreprojectionbool  kpchsteamvrallowreprojectionbool  kpchsteamvrforcereprojectionbool added   kpchsteamvrmotionsmoothingbool  kpchsteamvrmotionsmoothingoverrideint32 might still workaround bring back  whole unsupported valve 
getting added  middle switching new input bindings atm  bind  actions  say playspace move  next song buttonscombinations   chords   customize liking  next release 300 primarily going improvements play space mover performancefeatures  proper steaminput support  well misc things like getting chaperone warnings updated working 
arr got yeah wonder ’ difficult  ’ clue
s right think want really dont  video players vr put screen ceiling  environment  virtual floor  stays properly aligned use  void  environment floor  tilting whole virtual movie theater back terrible solution 
personally  heard people complain interfering games  maybe s revive thing 
okay  thanks lot info 
possible  steamopenvr nt apply repro headsets sooo could related  ll look 
three valve developers host gdc sessions spatial vr audio  storytelling  interactive musicvr audio

 spatial audio budget cuts   vr stealth game lakulish antani  interactive story without challenge mechanics  design firewatch  chris remo  audio bootcamp xviii  interactive musicvr audio implementation emily ridgway
probably wouldnt announce  hey re gon na announcing new games hardware  still  nt optimistic  good chances ll gdc 
clickbait  3  valve  vr 
pretty obvious half life 3 going vr game  want release another groundbreaking game better way release first true masterclass vr gaming  game makes everyone rush buy vr capable pc  like gamers back day able play half life 1 
op  sure got attention starting post “ three valve  ” still hoping gdc brings us interesting news 
valve discussing storytelling lol  last time storytold game 
s almost becoming  ironic  valve give sort speech making video games  developer  d written years ago 
first game use horror survivalimmersion well finally see “ may cause death waiver ”
s nt understand  valve like 500 employees right  slow releasing things  wish could take half long deadline driven job finish projects  
 something something 3 sessions  right moment disappointed yet  re gon na announce special announcement  anything  
  hrtfbased binaural rendering locating enemies  think  mexican   d  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  veiitdivnvgy  featureyoutube  t1m5s   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  veiitdivnvgy  featureyoutube  t1m5s 
weird topics valve discussing 
3 sessions    hl3 confirmed 
 deleted 
good audio budget cuts  ve never seen anyone mention 
valveinduced delusion come rvive 
agree premise extent halflife halflife 2 seeing expert refinement redefinition things already done  would delighted right think logic right money  think vr wild west moment little consensus among developers things like control locomotion makes people feel sick  even less among vr users  would seem trying make something ground breaking going appeal pretty much everyone incredibly tall order  even valve 
upcoming singleplayer firstperson adventure game  valley gods  
’ release artifact  also ’ constantly developing dota 2  ’ bug fixes  content  3 vr games rumored  right forgot  games ’ count ’ like 
s left game years ago  nt need make games  games expensive risky compared maintaining ve got 
reports interviews  seems like flat management structure means s often lot difficulty finding enough people viable team interested making game time  s always danger lose interest causing project fall apart  example  robin walker said glados conceived mostly disembodied voice could nt get enough artists help portal  orange box worked companywide  hack  force people help needed dev s pet game could nt released unless games also completed  incentive help teams needed art whatever  multiplayer games seem largely avoid problem  guess playing game office keeps people interested 
 spatial audio sdk   https  valvesoftwaregithubiosteamaudio   storytelling session former campo santo dev involving firewatch 
valve hire people valve nt actually make games  give talks  although  firewatch bunch nt make games either suppose logical decision 
going keep using current hardware  long reasonable wait generations decent improvement one generation next  starvr dying  many years wide field view  eye tracking etc 
thought turn spatialisation performance hit much game already pretty poorly performing 
onward also uses steam audio played beforeafter added  pretty significant difference  always decent positional audio sound feels accurate type room 
remember lazy  one particular section window noises outside playing  source outside noises actually point hovering coffee table middle room 
fact re using steam audio makes relevant  suppose 
s probably wrong though  assuming valve actually release hl3   ever  
oh make sense 
plus half life vr game s prequel
 deleted 
valve make games  ’ release  tell us  advertise 
making games  valve develops games  oddly purposely ’ tease anything game done freedom make whatever changes feel make products best  suck ’ heard anything games development years 
making games  nt know nt mean anything 
well  get pimax month wide field view higher res  eye tracking long ways imo
vrengineer xtal
1 years  2 pimax sitting front  sure talking probably soon since know pimax s partner  starvr one  s matter afford 
pimax ramping steadily 
yeah audio music game  hello   cohosting talk mentioned op together lakulish  cut good stuff sadly performance reasons  working get reimplemented talk  much audio issues due unity bug since resolved steam audio improved end well hopeful  essentially two weeks release forced remove months detailed tweaking polish quick rework entire mix  finest hour   
wo nt already confirmed multiple times 
plus cs  go danger zone  practically new game 
prequels count negative points  means cancels artifact left dota 2   old  game 
sure might appeal every casual player dota still huge millions monthly players even years ’ release  besides main point ’ silly say things stopped developing games ’ called game developer 
already lasted long one console generations  still one profitable played game pc regular esports event held  thats mass appeal  ’ need lie blatantly
’ probably hl3 decided convert vr
one changes could canceling game  feeling canceled  put hold 1 2 major projects seems much 
consider long  pimax going produce eye tracking module using existing tech  suspect see sale around summer 2019 also sounds like producing version work vive well 
m confident valve hmd wireless eye tracking  foveated rendering   possible right 
would order one put devkit orders pause figure going anything ip sell
someone bought budget cuts nt played yet  suggest waiting bit longer audio 
thank detailed insightful comment  imagine stressed heartbroken must felt time  hope work much fun ’ wait able play much improved sound 
wow  thanks info  glad s going changed soon  thanks hard work  rest teams  game 
ouch    good luck remaster — actually ’ got around playing full game yet works fine least 
awesome  ca nt wait talk  ve recently started reimplementing steam vr audio new update  excited see brings project  m hoping unity big speak performance issue well spatial audio 
reflections 
great  tell yall also cut second half game unexpectedly s also coming free update weeks 
hey  gdc  talked happened  ll check becomes available online point   nt think see audio update anywhere  news 
s barely mod  people made similar things gmod 
thing counting negative points around karma
moba card game  company made games like portal 2 left 4 dead  valve nothing selfsustaining system profiting steam framework 
 deleted 
course  anyone thinks would nt want use opportunity move huge amount hardware  fine  gives platform killer aaa game s win everyone  even people nt play  ever release standard pc title vr afterthought would really surprised  nt make business sense 
probably hl3 moment   leaks  pointing towards bunch regarding hlvr  wo nt hl3 
’ think ’ right  could true  ’ think confirmation three games hlvr 
leaked photos hmd guide hmd cord  also making wireless would increase cost entry would steer away potential customers  people vr means vr media  nt want wireless headset base model  yet 
freaking sucks  know month make profitable  m guessing s going well  sucks hear pretty much good gets right  thing better pimax  least s ve heard  bad could never afford one haha 
really  mean  ideally would play workstation 8 months ago sounded neato  life short fancy audiogizmo wo nt make break experience  never postpone fun 
d consider waiting  personally  mean   still get experience game  later  apparently  better sound  s exact enjoyment  slightly different time 
likely  found  made repro case convince unity support team  regardless spatialiser using  play   playoneshot   could case frame time hitch anything 2 10ms depending many sounds playing  apparently whenever sound played  internal audio system  older fmod version  would flush whole dsp graph reconstruct  even sound source already instanced playing  instance case  robot bleeds oil decals hit floor  super short splat sound  thought since oneshots audio source  would free less  dspwise   since like 30 splats seconds bug would absolutely tank performance  sounds like actually nt use spatialisation anymore   happening spatialiser steam audio 
’ idea yeah  turn use ambisonics reverb room feel  kind like using screen space effects instead rtx 
ha  quite almost  arcade mode coming free update  bunch levels vein demo 
wow  people really nt get sarcasm   get feelings hurt really easily 
 right forgot  games ’ count ’ like  see  nt like nt qualify nongames 
maybe  comment replying  many comments every time valve mentioned  nt really  even  person actually giving talk chris remo story designer firewatch hear game pretty much story 
hlvr confirmed valve either   leaks   hidden stuff  nothing official 
jeep confirmed  three months ago   https  wwwredditcomrvalvecomments9c5bgmgoodnewse58ta3m  context3  — admittedly recent  hearing nothing months expected valve 
need give time  month seems like want die  bother research development product  people damn fickle get anything major done  stuff like  people think elon musk idiot  gets stuff done  ca nt buy one going make profit  like held water till damn bubbles stop 
word  thanks 
s good know going forward  thanks information  would insane hit performance  bet frustrating 
’ assume rtx could used directly audio possibly efficiently ai dithering 
much difference make according  impressed audio playthrough wonder d able notice difference 
came bad joke 
man ’ even know one  yeah agree  hearing nothing months expected 
exactly
reverb  works  bug audio completely dry  sound pretty sweet gives great sense size space  reflections give pretty good gameplay cues  could hear robot patrolling halls coming vent  yet still able pinpoint s location distance based materials sound bounced etc  whereas steps leak walls  d say bit immersive  fair bit better gameplay  especially stealth one 
m willing bet little difference allot comes affecting senses experiencing fresh developing like  also bet make encounter  mr  even terrifying 
3dsenvr  previously known 3dnesvr  manually approved steam review team  latest demo returned back steam ready tried  feedback welcome appreciated  ps  sorry audio quality  pc good enough vr recording

next time put less important text belongs  text box
well wishlisted  looks amazing 
wow  nice work  says light gun support  mean tracked controllers working light guns 
need asap  ll buy sure s priced ridiculously  chance get virtual room tv playing  would icing cake 
people bought already given steam codes 
nice  load rom  guess takes manual effort decide elements become 3d different ways 
name change 
way rebind keyboard controls  qwertz keyboard fan yz binding  cfg files nt look like easy manual edit  way change rom ve previously chosen one game  nt know demo vr version  thanks offering 
testing steam vr via windows mixed reality  dell visor   fun  s running emulator area low  like looks like floor  ve adjusted floor height mr portal s ok games  make playable rotating zooming play area  static stuff  scoretimer  stays put  anyway adjust rest world position 
features identical demo supports 10 games 
sincerely idea  principle works headsets supporting steamvr oculus runtime  always could give demo try though 
re keeping wmr mind building well cv1 vive  m guessing pretty universal  steamvr  usually  okay job making shit  work   ymmv 
m crack shot 
calm frodo  valve working got ta give little time 
thank advice  honestly seems equally important however  sincerely 
yes end video play wild gunman touch controller 
s nes 3d vr wo nt tv screen contain  
steam key  thank  bottom heart 
technically loads rom demo ten games polish optimized 3d profiles   manual effort  interpretation 
s request steam review team reviewing process avoid potential future trademark conflict 
use keyboard  nt anticipated yet  motion controller gamepad  fyi gamepad motion controller lag free gamepad still small lag  rebind rom  point game slot press left trigger select button  s stated help tab 
think best solution adjust height   stand long press menu button reset hmd position  sit enjoy game make sure seating mode 
well  practice many steamvr games work  work lame pimax demo good thing  ca nt wait try  playing donkey kong vr  omg

s talking model tv inside vr environment
awesome  thank making awesome app 
makes sense  happens load rom without 3d profile 
keyboard vastly superior trying use vive wand touchpads dpad  probably better rift   gamepad  dpad thing nt best either  prefer keyboard nt need analog input  left trigger rebind rom  huh  alright thanks  staring help tab  seems like went past somehow  oh keyboard controlling menu nt work right  arrow keys work moving around main entries  s 
thanks  tried  letting go menu button long press  ui flashes correct position right front face  whether standing sitting  millisecond  goes back being floor   ve tried positional tweaks steam vr nt seem work  game   believe gets data wmr subsystem passthrough  ve tried motion controllers  dualshock4 bluetooth  combination controller types  controllers work fine ui elements work  change settings load game save snapshot  behavior regards ui on floor   maybe wmr related bug  interested supporting platform provide debug data setup wish 
donkey kong 3d  25d  vr sir  
""
s implicit way inform s software audio quality  think s important 
m aware nes emulator supporting vr 2d 3d
understand 3d scene normal 2d  could put tv 
ui nt allow  still trick link profile different rom  case rendering would quite flat like original 2d screen nt want break experience wrong 3d objects 
control ui controller keyboard  change control method gaze  laser beam nt make sense case  keyboard default binding  select  space bar  start  enter  menu  backspace hold backspace sec releasing quickly change view

nt see would nt necessary  matters s
well done  ve played emulators support vr however nothing supports lights guns  amazing 
plenty  one emuvr 
already done  emuvr s awesome  lightgun support looks fantastic though  well whole thing  emuvr supports many many consoles free  main competitor guess 
understandable  thanks info 
looks like wmr issue specific 3dsenvr regards headset position vr space  steamvr games work fine wmr headset controllers 
m sure whooshed whooshed  
people find things complain  nothing really wrong title
emuvr also converts game 3d 
ahh s clear  s obviously 3dnesvr issue  willing help test builds solve  nt one test  beta testers rifter viver 
definitely got wooshed
 talking putting game tv vr environment  s  snes  nes  playstation  megadrive  etc etc  customize bedroom posters stuff  nt lightgun support yet either  3d games  something unique 
sure  d happy beta tester wmr help  inbox prefer  ve enjoying emulator projects since mid 90s  really cool effort going 
frodoelijah woodkid scene gets wild gun man game working bttf 2  also valve working brain control interface tech made joke joke real thing 
excellent  pm  thank 
ya broke quote train
great  also since rifters vivers get handle  us wmr brigade known mixers  😉

movie nights going international  restricted north america 
bigscreen development funded 
nt able try yet m assuming menu behaves like normal vr menu instead unreliable tablet
option old cinema back  new one gorgeous  really like look feel old one  felt much like going movies irl 
snagged bigscreen awhile back mess around ended fun probably  really enjoy app suggest people check 
grand theatre coming back  one felt really relaxing secure  really bummed saw missing  new lighting everything insane nt get wrong  feels like overkill watch tv show really massive screen living room bright austere 
video  rvive  blasphemy 
work linux yet   either native via steamplay  
ba abke watch 3d blu ray s 
bigscreen offer movement options still teleporting 
use vr headset 90hz screen 
huge update  good job guys 
excited movie nights  wanting since saw 2017 top gun event post 
seeing ray tracing work mobile devices  m assuming works gpu rtx cards  sweet 
ray tracing take use dx12 s dxr implementation ray tracing thus using rt cores rtx 2080ti increased performance 
new app disappointing thing ve ever seen  crashes constantly even high performance computer 8700k 2080ti 2700x 1080ti  freezes take hmd long  ca nt host rooms randomly crash  use virtual keyboard outputs ever feels like spitting  got rid everyone s favorite big room theater one asked  use tab alt navigate desktop  never seen app get worse worse way one
congrats great update  ’ wait test weekend 
question  accounts going required general nongroup use 
shweeet
adjust bigger screen ’ distance size void  
wait take advantage nvidia rtx cards 
available 1015 international countries  countries world due licensing restrictions  complexities 
got lot investment startup  made blog post  https  blogbigscreenvrcombigscreenraises11millioninseriesafinancingledbytrueventuresa2d49da40e plan making money selling virtual movie tickets go virtual cinema friends  definitely case live around world  watch movie together  maybe also selling cosmetics  s announced far
people bigger wallets ideas us
yeah  s similar recroom climbey d say  big ol buttons press either laser pointer touching like touchscreen
tablet instead touch screen
linux support planned time due limited time resources
m pretty sure ve   able 
yes  depends bluray video player though  work bigscreen
like ud2shanks said  watch right player  people reported  leawo   http  wwwleawocomblurayplayer  works nt output drm video signal  s reason bluray players nt work   tend completely rip blurays using tool like makemkv s normal video file output works perfectly
’ bit  free movement  bigscreen still meant seated experience
today  already working like 90fps desktop resolution
d great joined vr anime society sessions  aj xd
event great  watching movie big screen  also 3d well  without 3d glasses   pretty mindbending 
yeah  nt use rtx  raytracing around long time s invention nvidia  amount raytracing need seems low even phones devices like oculus go  probably would nt worth development hours make utilize rtx  performance gains losses rtx card
 attach rtx phone usb cable   kidding 
nope  ’ use dxr
like shanks said  nt use rtx dxr  amount raytracing need seems low even phones devices like oculus go  probably would nt worth development hours make utilize rtx
released bugfix today changelog  fixed crash app start   pc  maybe s fixed  try
pc crashes program  must program pc 
create account want use bigscreen solooffline   skip  button  
using joystick rift  think  swiping touchpad vive grabbing  monitor  alternatively use buttons right side monitor make adjustments
raytracing bigscreen nt use rtx  raytracing around long time s invention nvidia  amount raytracing need seems low even phones devices like oculus go  probably would nt worth development hours make utilize rtx  performance gains losses rtx card
vpn time   
list available countries please 
re available country  c
sounds like good fair business model 
least test steamplay 
watch 3d  need 2 images side side  one eye  rip makemkv  get 
playspace mover
mean without monitor  would need 90hz vitual screen already real 144hz monitor 
thanks  appreciate guys 
yeha read thread posting saw  thanks response though  wish would implement real rtx though  would neat see 
bigscreen currently available worldwide  movie nights vary permovie
nt actually tried yet  m afraid s going rely lowdeep windows api s s going pretty much impossible stream  sure  maaaaaaaaaaaaybe ll able join people s rooms though
tried  unfortunately crashes start 
ripped 3d bluray  would assume  yeah
socializing vr better pancake 144hz monitor size imax 
yeah sure  although would prefer platformneutral raytracing solution nt limit people nvidia cards     x200b  right priorities making stable useful feature  course getting virtual movie tickets system running
let s hope belgium list  fingerscrossed 
afaik re using desktop duplication api grabbing screen  super deep windows api  ca nt find references implemented wine yet  implementation nt impossible future  perhaps bit latency though  likely also low priority wine maintainers 
cool  know people dont like proprietary stuff  hardware exists  use know 
proton 
takes lot work implement  s plug play xd
audio trip looks pretty good s like non amateur hour version synth riders
""
forum give much hate synthriders  absolute blast 
hey 👋 thank much sharing video  definitely great workout game much fun cardio gym  regarding comment believe games mentioned offer something different  positive vr  variety important cater different audiences  synth riders quest embargo till 31st looking forward sharing soon  much love 👊
d rather play synthriders
video plays  bet play game vr trolling  play rythem games vr audio trip starts synth riders stand year ago  looks promising ways go  map synth riders 150 custom songs  know facts stay better silent little wanky world thx 
curious  sr devs 
certainly prefer visuals synth riders far  see promise game shows little bland visually  stick synth riders thank sharing video 
way better synthriders  someone nt played looks like exact thing different skin
dude re killing  game looks hard  need try  might need hefty sweatband first  nt usually move like lol
liv support 
like rythim games buy  compared money spent hardware nothing good games multiple differences
moves awesome    1 shame failing  20 songs full release  twice opportunity bust move  bust ass lol
want know vr dead people like see thread prop bad games try bury good ones  nothing mad 
actually prefer synthriders beat saber  rocky start even refunded first gave second chance saw updates quickly became one time favorite vr games 
s highly mediocre compared rhythm games spam gets annoying 
prefer synth beats popular music  s cool  d give try  amazing 
synth riders toilet paper year ago  s toilet paper beat saber written  want 150 custom songs ll play beat saber 
didnt anything make bad game pay shills tell s good 
difference see different skin  nt know tell bro https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vno3mugaf6nq  featureyoutube  t84
yes listed steam page
game looks like absolutely destroys synth riders  watch video 
nt understand hate  anything  give optimistic criticism allows developers update game fix bugs  synth riders great game  audiotrip also looking like could nice game  audiences  like synth riders like audiotrip  nt call game like mediocre  cause could also call say audiotrip looks mediocre  nt  people wo nt either  cause respect choice  smart 
synthriders ton popular music custom song community custom song site like beatsaver beat saber  https  synthriderzcom
age 10 lower btw fact answer lack proof give really answer 
assumption rough time difficult settings dont get truly experience synthriderz offer  btw audio trip game looks exactly like synthriderz clone far less appealing aesthetics 
 pay shills lol
differentiated rude audio trip players  re giving 
use  video would look 10x better liv 
absolutely destroy  synth riders  m genuinely curious  dude spends entire songs awkward forward bend  fun  audio trip lot potential mapping feels like s dragging around instead leading 
m saying s mediocre based fact ve played every vr rhythm game  except taikovr s next    nt call game like mediocre see nt get  opinion games play 
probably long since royalties paid 
synth riders much less polished  d play know  audio trip made one guys worked job simulator  synth riders made  guy mom s basement  
ok laughed  omfg wish sr paying shill though  games lit 
yeah got ta admit  gave chuckle  
guys  chill  need comparisons puts another game vr space fronts  vr space still small replacement model content  vr still long way go get people space kinder one another 
choose one based quality rude players  better buy blade sorcery either like game  hear s pretty good one called  sorcery blade vr  people seem like  hear nice people 
s video found internet 
opinion nt mean say aloud  unless critism includes tips help make game generally better  inclines helping developers find flaws  find opinion exists hurt  mentioned spam  tried higher difficulties unique patterns  find opinion lacks base argument  nt immediately jump conclusions  rather  give feedback developers make game better  
indie devs spreading shill bills like billion dollar company
 kinder one another kinder   internet forum   preposterous  joking aside  much vr need new games  encouraging shovelware directly copying something else maybe nt best move  s wasted talent imo
m giving best kind feedback play different game s better  play video games  really help synth riders devs make money  lack experience shows  advice would hire better experienced people 
want cash  
dude  beat saber  audio trip  synth riders began development knew  please realize long takes make game  end day  ’ significantly different games serve different styles play content  thankful diversity vr choices  oh  even people taking personal risk make games first place 
 please gim dat cash 
 make games nt open source project  money  
long think could work 20hour days something without paid  working project two years huge risk indie  without people willing take risks games  vr particular  many games think ’ available play  many  exist would huge studios took risks made something bland 
saying project done threat failure humanitarian project  think want world gifted unique opportunity buying game already exists  re trying get piece pie like everyone else  even nt case  asking money ca nt expect judged lightly   free pass  something cost money 
’ saying without would games play except big studio shovelware  also pointed  three games listed begun announced  meaning ’ copies  ever occur people similar ideas independently  even  actually bothered play  ’ find quite different  specifically designed without knowing unique area focus 
 actually bothered play  ’ find quite different well m spending actual money  find   nt grow trees mate  far  despite asking  one willing tell difference  suspect s mostly different skin  given s recent nature  without interesting mods custom map 
difference sr dance focused involves wider range physical movement  also invr editor soon adding custom songs really easy 
well thank  still think difference little light  especially one nt  yet  know  know  dance focused involves wider range  sr smaller play area map design choice 
’ combination level design fact couple additional gameplay elements sr facilitate certain moves

s good  price bullshit  s blatant  shameless cashgrab taking advantage fact shipped notverycomfortable product begin  completely resent
strap expensive never regretted moment  pushes headset gently head rather hanging original strap single dial turn tighten loosen strap rather clumsy trio velcro straps original 
headphones  would biggest seller point ’ look great  anyone give personal thoughts

im thrifty 4 must accessories make vive drastically comfier  1st get pu leather replacement face foam  really get fov  foam gets soooo gross  2nd deluxe strap makes sit head way way better 3rd replace deluxe foam back ofyout head cushy pleather one  desingers miss cheap material 4th hygenic cover new face puleather insert  super duper hmd comfort  ragrets 
 able pop headset audio seems nice  rest strap also make comfortable  yes  put onoff separate headset audio great  weighs less large wireless overear headphones ve using  good neck  audio quality deluxe headstrap also superb ask  also changes weight distribution hmd  much weight resided two pressure points cheekbones das wandered forehead  rigid sides back make stable head also easier quicker adjiust people  someone wants try  fairly expensive d buy

thanks  3in1 cable thing  seems like 40 lot  twist much 
recommend one get  see lot misc results coming searching  thanks 
nah twists even ask  internally  older broad 3in1 could least see pretty quick direction twisting goes untwist fairly easy  new cable different  try untwist much want  still wants curl  said  cable twists inside outer layer  positive side  seems less prone breaking old one  really take care step cable since day 1  old broke year  new still holding 2 years playing  new cable also less heavy pull strong old one 
tbh  important thing come 6mm 11mm nt wear glasses recommend 6mm  makes closer lenses  glasses 11mm better

switched das vive pro das og vive  vive pro pretty much update og das 
ve happy vive pro stock htc vive wireless top  das retired 2016 vive needed sure  m saving das rift franken mod future  get sick horrible sound rift  ps  vr sim racing feels better oculus vr much vive index 
lens swap mod  get 6mm facepad  pull screen lashes  knuckles controllers  think s pretty much best headset setup could possibly get atm 
das pretty much attach vive pro without issue  require lot modding  remember finding og vive das  tpcast battery quite comfortable  although ca nt decide s better vive pro  pros cons   said  without battery counterweight  front heavy  least opinion   switching das result happening pro  well 
could link bought strap adapters ebay   
yep pretty much  although find actualoriginal das fits better  prefer sound  found strap vive pro bit mushy wobbly  great vr re moving around lot  maybe s head shape  guess depends individual 
 ps  vr sim racing feels better oculus vr much vive index  yeah  sometimes wonder wouldnt better rift  trade vive pro  d missing oled display  runs 80hz  might worth still  know oculus  asw much better valve s crappy motion smoothing 
lens mod scares  figure d get dust hair somehow  plus ve heard people complain barrel distortion  would nice improve lenses though 6mm facepad actually d removed pro strap putting weight forehead  foam comfortable  maybe give another try
 require lot modding  nope  two screws inside pro release strap  pop headphone connectors  coil wires inside hmd  adapters go resulting holes hmd pop right das  pretty secure   x200b   said  without battery counterweight  front heavy  least opinion   switching das result happening pro  well  nope  noticed problems balance  batterytpcast mounted rear would probably improve

irrational annoyed friend nt play psvr headphones  rather surround sound audio 
feel like cheating better experience
annoyed irrational definition 
since asked  would never play without 3d positional sound headphones provide  would nt annoyed someone else  yeah  little irrational worry someone else s preference 
explained s getting 3d audio 
beat saber blast surround set  headset needed 
s irrational  s clearly tosser would nt anything
depends game  encourage friends use headphones think matters  games nt add much prefer able talk friends play
getting annoyed normal  remember s friend likes  nt likely convince otherwise  reasons
headphones give 3d audio
echo caused people using tv sound firewall annoying hinders teammates ability listen footsteps signal jammer  etc  s playing s irrational  re playing together dealing echo  s totally rational 
hi yamaha surround sound amp rx a2070  looking getting ps4 pro vr headset  yea know late party     sorry crashing thread  surround sound  sound field  10 existing speaker system  move move vr world  eg  move head left sound scape moves etc  ditch suround sound plug headphones port headset kit  thanks john
ca nt wear either  ever since kid sneaked scared shit 
would nt say irrational maybe s comfortable friend wear headphones  much gear head   said  recently discovered better motion sickness certain games wearing headphones opposed playing game surround sound setup  maybe bring friend case heshe even issues motion sickness 
rarely use headphones  want able hear ’ happening room someone talking room  turn feature passes sound mic picks  mostly let hear breathing  ’ work well
prefer tv sound  headphones make ears hot itchy
thank mr data  
 s perfectly rational one annoyed someone wronged one 
even know definition word definition  mate
songs really really benefit 12 ” subwoofer 
mean 30 year friendship  see point s dead
thats thinking
fantastic  ’ also ignorant called friend  ignorant knowing actually sounds better headphones  ignorant making listen gameplay mic 
feel like makes pussy playing scary games like  jk
wont get 3d audio
earbuds 
spock   great reference 
annoyed emotion  opposite ratio  observer could say s  logical  situation evokes emotion  still nt make  rational  reaction person

good man  s dead rest us 
could always play scary sound effects phone different parts room mess  
use headphones plugged headset get 3d audio  headset recommend please  thanks way 
im cheeky clear
yeah arent plugged dont get 3d audio  use hyperx cloud 2 https  wwwamazoncadpb00saycvtqrefcmswrotherapairqkkcbch4s865 used use sony golds material ear pads flaked  personally id suggest ones like ear muffs cover whole ears noise cancelling instead ear buds  immersive way

open psvr headset sort audio issue
""
wait  s hollow world        
losing audio right hand side slid visor  opened headset look cause  issue connector right large grey ribbon cable  wire cable come clip putting strain connector  reseating cable  giving wires bit room flex  seems sorted issue 👍 edit  nt expect post quite popular  nt soundcloud  could check youtube channel  jimster71  would lovely  thank 
thank even thinking taking photo share  always insanely curious god s name contraption gives much joy really looks like inside 
nsfw dude   
johnny five alive 
quite bit technology 😳
s simple compared modern day electronics hardons integrated flex boards
m always worried dust get behind lenses open
s pretty
pictures 
nt know look  s naked psvr 
idk cool
glad got working 
never seen inside psvr googled  usually technology teardown video  phone  otherwise  youtube feed  m even surprised s taken long ve seen inside 
easy would say would replace main wire  2 headsets  one cable knackered  one seems slightly scuffed lenses want combine bit bit scared ruin useable one 
void stickers  m thinking opening mine  nt want sony deny repair ca nt fix anything
damn looks really cool  wish could something like see processing unit screaming 
https  mimgurcomgalleryy4yfthe
warranty void
appears run sort electricity
god luck 
yup  lotta stuff 
huh   amazing  fairies  surely nt expect believe see comes gizmos 
damn  water cooling tho
would look super cool clear shell 
yup  technology parts 
think problem  plug audio head set vr headset getting sound one side  m currently problem  thought ear buds problem different headphones  unplug headphones little get left instead right  fully plugged hear right  thought headset jack needed new vr headset  saying could cable coming unplugged vr headset 
much blurry  ca nt see enough details 
v2 psvr   opened back headband  posted fix sound constantly working one side  never mind  read comment 
kinda crazy much wasted space compared consumer electronics  looks like could reduce weight 23rds wanted 
ok
apologies  used spoiler tags 
yeah  expected sandbox paper cutout characters strings move around  maybe blue painted part skies 
happens  use double sided tape hold ribbon place  use glue gun thin ribbons warping cheap cables car 
problem  hard open 
yeah dude cool  thanks sharing  would never seen inside one otherwise  s like reverse nes cartridges  expected see air 
cable talking picture  could anyone circle please 
assume    https  iimgurcomfrvh4kupng   red circle  hmd cable  think mine getting dodgy might replace soon  much hassle  would open done 
ll love   https  wwwifixitcomteardownplaystationvrteardown69341   https  wwwifixitcomteardownplaystationvrteardown69341 
tempted tag 😁
 lewd 
nt casings  see bare circuits 
s rubber seal screen lenses prevent dust ingress 
 took quick snap phone  complete teardown linked comments thread though 
""
think would tricky  would also dismantle headband cable comes headset 
practice deemed illegal  free open product purchased repaired third party without voiding warranty  unless damaged device opening attempting repair 
stickers  expect sony would try refuse warranty repair suspected opened though  warranty  expect nt fussy 
full sound visor extended  slid visor  lost sound right  tried different headphones  knew nt earbuds  good search turned old redditforum post suggested could cableconnector problem  connector nt come unplugged  cable come normally routed flexing visor moved  putting strain connector  could well loose connection  nt investigate seemed working ok rerouted cable 
yeah air extra plastic weighs much 
m guessing empty space temperature control  s also looks like s relying heavily ribbons connectors  nt shout long durability 
yeah  least d expect found something like  https  monsterlegacyfileswordpresscom201708mibrosenbergjpg   https  monsterlegacyfileswordpresscom201708mibrosenbergjpg 
s cable going connector  ribbon  good advice anyway 
teardown videos youtube  s worth watching couple see seems 
may worth  100 sony charges fix headsets usually instead taking apart  s though usually send new one back 
common problem v2
 https  wwwifixitcomteardownplaystationvrteardown69341   https  wwwifixitcomteardownplaystationvrteardown69341 
s connector several thin wires going  third way top third way right 
s video part hmd cable  connector join circle audiomic hmd cable one messing  thinner cable  goes along wider cable  back headset 
bender quote 
s good 
s warranty  since release
excellent  issue  finally discovered courage attempt post  good share

let know discover issue please  really curious cause since using headsets 
adjusted nothing timing seriously perfect  playing expert timing even important issues  maybe something camsetup  cam eyelevel sit playing 
im going try  also feel like guns sometimes dont shot im aiming 
ll  going test settings tonight  know game unplayable anything like default settings  probably 95  players even notice m seeing  s fact m avid beat saber player m sensitive audio video perfectly sync  post findings afterwards 
ve updated op results calibration test last night 
interesting  play ps4 pro psvr v2 headset use playstation gold headphones wired connection directly psvr headset  also camera eyelevel play standing  know developer explained regular ps4 uses native 60hz refresh rate   gets   reprojected 120 hz   ps4 pro uses native 90 hz refresh rate  maybe something  also found post top ten pro drums player rock band 4 raudica noticed thing psvr version  recommended calibration settings  20 video  20 input  still need try  info   https  wwwredditcomraudicacommentsdtlg8pgameplaysettingspsvrcalibration   https  wwwredditcomraudicacommentsdtlg8pgameplaysettingspsvrcalibration 
would also suggest turning score popup whenever hit target options menu  made feel like could see better s happening field view  made able concentrate better beat song 
interesting   afaik calib spot try  see spot difference  cheers 
hi  m also using ps4 pro  using default earplugs came psvr  maybe calib due using different earphones 
hey  ’ planning making calibration guide video  quickly  audio changed  need sync video input audio  start input  timing window  invisible   shoot targets beat  ideally without looking  see far game says  adjust input much  tells way move calibration settings   adjust video whatever feels right  moves visual rings soonerlater  hopefully made sense  video much clearer  ’ got numbers mentioned  beat advanced campaign  5ms  often 
also use pro v2 headset included earbuds  ve noticed issues  suspect sony golds processing  even wired  adds delay 
thanks feedback  explains lot  going try next session  m looking forward calibration guide video 
m entirly sure  since default settings 20 video  40 input  new settings use 20 video  20 input   video calibration set 40 ms    earlier     less delay  default video calibration settings  would nt surprised default settings psvr specific numbers ported pcvr platforms  since use hardware screen psvr settings theoretically exact effect psvr players  would still like advise try new setting song 2  testing range  compare new settings feel gameplay check score average timing offset  shown end song  improves decreases new settings  results worse easily revert back default calibration settings click button 
oh  since said game thinks ’ shooting right beat  able simply adjust video fix visual lag mentioned 
fiddling around lot different calibration settings must agree     20 video  20 input     seems golden standard audica s psvr version calibration settings  least case re using wired headphoneearbuds connection psvr headset  everything seems sync nicely average timing offset far lowest compared settings tried  less  5ms   increased previous best scores 1 attempt  without even trying  soon started playing new calibration settings    aim target   also seems lot closer bullseye song scoreboard visualisation  would suggest anyone enter settings manually play songs confirm feel good  even game gives completely values using automatic calibration  tool 
settings timing bit  manual calibrate input got 39 result  default setting 40  20 would way  anyway  weird need use different settings least fixed setup  
weird indeed  still curious cause effect  first thing m thinking different refresh rate ps4   60 hz reprojected 120 hz   ps4 pro use   native 90 hz   audica  maybe cause difference video calibration  well  long enjoy game optimally s good either way  
pro  last song career mode damn  last 30 seconds  hypnotizing 
someone else tried numbers ’ right either  despite hardware  pro  v2 headset   ’ really confused causing difference 
m using default earplugs  using different headphones original ones 
m using official playstation gold headset   tommythegun   https  wwwredditcomusertommythegun  pointed  wired connection introduce lag  matter headphones re using  strangely  must admit settings perfect yesterday nt seem correct anymore last playthrough  almost looked every 15 minutes playing  offset late additional 10 ms corrected calibration menu seemed late another additional 10 ms minutes play  sure s getting fatigued otherwise  finish songs expert  think got pretty good feel game moment  last playthrough ended playing 20 video  10 input  take note  final settings yet  ran time testing plan use weekend fine tune setting  also noticed took headphones could hear wife talking  audio coming tv exactly sync audio coming headphone speakers  know yet mean  know beat saber audio comes slightly later tv headphones result echo effect listening time  since audica audio sync tv headphones plan use headphones laying around house wired connection  see holds true headphones  confirm using another headphone wired connection affect audio delay  also found method get exact video calibration settings  fill later process  go work right  
updated op tutorial calibrate properly  seems point sharing calibration settings end different results using settings 
’ using apple earpods  since ’ still wired ’ imagine introducing much lag  ’ thing messing settings  would still “ gap ” numbers  audio would change  possibilities   different move controller hardware  changes headsets  like v2 v21 ’ thing
yeah  could anything point  maybe even game buffering up downloading leaderboard info  forgot mention also use 2tb sshd   solidstate hybrid drive   ps4 pro  ve updated op method calibrate game  seems give best results point  still need furhter fine tune calibration settings   ran time test    going testing weekend  m planning recalibrate everything disconnected internet  make sure less interference possible 
 also use 2tb sshd  solidstate hybrid drive  ps4 pro  use stock hdd  said numbers worked  makes sense storage effect  s good confirm everything  record  move controllers newer ones  model cechzcm 2u micro usb port  uwarrie2 
mine older ones bigger port  maybe s difference
use older move wands mini usb ports  bought ps4 twin pack  identical ps3 move controllers  came ps4 vr branded package  last night spent 2 hours trying find optimal calibration settings noticed weird things happening  eg  general input seemed registered 10 ms early  added 10 ms input offset calibration menu counter  played song suddenly said input 40 late something  nt think actually much late  yet s game told  seems kind weird correlation   bug    makes looks like timing offset shown end song  displayed ms   milliseconds   seem correspond 11 videoinput numbers shown calibration menu  also supposed shown ms   milliseconds    could well link input video offset  changing one also result changing timing   without changing values    earlier assumption input offset set correctly beat hearing  input offset would stay exactly   relative beat music   change video settings afterwards  m sure anymore  basically meant adding subtracting general offset numbers shown end song gave results expecting  guess values enter calibration menu whenever noticed offset play  use lot trial error see results getting better worse whenever changed input andor video offset  moment m using   20 video  25 input    seem give best results far  still going tinker little bit tonight end gameplay session getting late  felt finished calibrating  might nitpicky  game well playable settings  annoys able get perfect want calibration settings make sense  actually understand happens under hood  change either input video get best settings possible xd 
wow  ’ try test 
m thinking increasing target speed maximum calibration session tonight  make easier spot video earlylate  hope finally find definitive settings suit  finally concentrate playing game ranking highscores  way  feel free add friends list challenge s leaderboard scores  nobody friends list moment plays audica  would nice competition  even though m getting started game   psn name  thabennl
  ’ tommyguncrg  ’ play vr really long periods time  scores probably ’ great  plus   finally   bought beat saber vr time split 
added  ’ currently  14 overall leaderboard  despite really bad scores due modifiers songs  literally score ’ trying get expert campaign right now—but ’ probably true lot people  second  ’ right  calibration wonky  adjusted video lot  shot targets eyes closed  timing changed  makes sense  ’ even know  today played 10  10  basically fine  like said  game pretty generous ’  really  matter much  ’ frustrating  maybe ’ ask discord see answer 
new game patch went live final calibration testing tonight   patch notes audica version 101   https  iibbco8x65gkfpatchnotesjpg  explained earlier post input calibration tests close 20 times  interesting  times results came fairly close  every seems unexplained big deviation  ignored results big deviations used remaining numbers calculate average input offset  ended   20 video  5 input    https  iibbcoddnyv4saudicacalibrationjpg  sure increased decreased numbers manually couple time also played default settings see results might get better  ended getting early  late  registrations whenever used different values  feel input timing window perfect   20 video  5 input   especially playing higher difficulties  new settings managed clear  everyday  expert 98  rating   https  iibbcoyfl5yf6everydayexpertjpg   m currently  number 17 world   https  iibbcotwtsfw317thjpg  song  confirmed new calibration settings perfect stick  ps  noticed another thing think noteworthy regards read offset data  cases still average offset  let s say example 20ms  look size tallest blue orange bars  indicate timing offset hit targets  bars actually end close 0 ms indicator  even though average offset number displayed 20  confirmed d example 2 terrible timed late shots  average offset immediately lean towards late section  looking length placement colored bars might reveal shots actually perfectly timed  nt make mistake looking offset number using feedback make adjustments calibration settings  ll need take account length placement tallest colored bars timeline well understand whole picture  one time noticed fairly late offset number shown end song  looking tallest colored bars revealed hit targets actually slighty early  aware  s finally time play enjoy game  see leaderboards  
yeah  seems real rhyme reason nt see numbers re expecting see change either video input offset certain amount ms trial error method seem get pretty good results moment   24 video  13 input     real science behind  ended picking random numbers found something felt good enough    ve decided try one method evening least sciene behind  least hope   call quits start playing campaign enjoy game  already spend much time testing range  lol  said  game pretty generous hit window offset nt impact score  need nt worry much  s ocd kicking seeing offset numbers appear end song  would nice developers could clarify calculate average offset  missed targets affect end result   calibration process general psvr version    x200b  final test tonight following   let move controllers charge re 100   set video input offset back games default settings   adjust video target s bullseye overlaps telegaph bullseye hear beat   ll start input calibration test  shoot 10 targets eyes closed moment hear beat   test ends game tell results input offset test  ll write number   ll reset input offset back game s default setting restart input test eyes closed write new input offset number appears   ll repeat last steps 10 times  calculate average input offset based 10 numbers manually enter number input offset  ca nt think way get  least theory  accurate results moment  hope translates better offset results scoring screen end song well  ll update results soon 
nice work  ’ still using 1010  fc ’  2 score  recording time post video soon   maybe better calibration would scored points  though   ’  ’ try numbers see work system 
tried numbers  ’ work  getting 25ms testing range  eyes closed  testing  ended 105  ’ really sick calibrating 
m going make another long post wanted share following  fine tuning seem get better  maybe  best    results    20 video  6 input     got  full combo 5 gold stars everyday  expert   https  iibbco568rvx1goldstarsjpg   curently m    5 position world leaderboards   https  iibbconncq08q5jpg  song seem get pretty consistent results  case picture nt clear  score chart said following    timing     avg offset  3 ms  spread  25 ms  avg score  692  750 pts
        update        making post  noticed actually ended exact input offset number  interesting  must confess playing harder difficulties much going basically aim shoot beat audio without time see targets align perfectly telegraph notes  maybe video lagging bit since nt change default video offset numbers  m going try video offset numbers see work  might finally onto something     x200b          original post        s weird indeed  way  reset video input offset game s default settings time performing new calibration eyes closed  noticed reset input offset default calibration run  results would kinda number time   exceptions    nt revert back game s default video input offset calibration test run   forgot reset new calibration test run   new calibration numbers way charts compared previous runs  almost seems nt revert back default settings performing new test tun game actually show offset number relative last custom calibration numbers games zeropoint    40 input assume     means use 20 video  5 input starting calibration test run eyes closed  end weird offset number  however playing game numbers  offset shown scoring page end song seems perfectly fine  hope makes sense  kinda hard explain text  s also decided change game s default video offset end  seems complicate things  input offset multiple times manually calculate average offset described earlier post  resetting back default settings time new test run  ended 5 average input offset still using games default video offset seem perfectly sync numbers setup  long feel game responds best numbers could well case numbers work perfect setup  m going continue playing game take screenshots scoring page song coming days  compare see results seem consistent calibration might need use adjustments 
nice job 
yep  know exactly re saying  made post discord  asked testing range needs exited reset fully  etc  hopefully someone answer insight   noticed actually ended exact input offset number  noticed  nt know numbers perfect even great  sick testing seemed okay  reinforce weird system  since numbers totally wrong  changed   video  became much better  ideally would test actual songs  changing one number time  playing eyes closed  recording play back check visual timing well  slow motion   really want play actual game point 
 ideally would test actual songs  true  even think count offset data shown song playthroughs complete full combo  way know sure average offset shown artificially tilted one direction misfiresmissed targets  probably use system excludes example 10 earliest 10 latest registered input offsets song use remainder calculate average input offset data   nt already something like place    would show meaningful number us use manual calibration  also  stated earlier post timing offset luckily impact scoring system  wrong  timing actually makes large portion scores     750 total possible 2000 points per target based timing     see guide detailed explanation scoring system   https  steamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetails  id1725944274   https  steamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetails  id1725944274    x200b    really want play actual game point  feel ya xd

miss rjdj dimensions app  cant find anything  take  😢
rjdj apps made  dimension intrusion 5 6 created specific movies  honestly blew mind  interesting amazing  sudden stopped working  still apps phone nt compatible current os  ve hoping updated pop somewhere  luck  actually nt hear app  check one 
gaming though  seems  actual sound involved demo 
cool  quite looking though  proprietary  couple proprietary app  ve seen one bose devices  none actually filter sound ambient noisemusic however like inception hear apps  technology really apply pair headphones mic  one drawback nt work bluetooth  m guessing lag  could compare anything  like acid trip sorts 
specific examples  would thought app store would full 
interesting  nt think lack demand problem though  apple s ecosystem seem specialize taking things one asked turning musthaves 
multiple times  email  twitter  name  one day two years neglect new update appeared  turns new  filter  could purchase buck extra   noticed favorite audio filter  relax  nt working like used  still nt  felt like socalled update dev going fishing loose change  hitting atm old account see money left 
still get hear  used last week  going coffee shops place want block noise  s still useful  replaced buds inear buds pretty much block noise  m thinking s redundant  tell think 
forgot mention one useful freestyles super hearing allows turn mic enhance hearing  even listening music re aware surroundings  quality depends mic though 
use iphone occasionally ipad  like said  using apple earbuds nt adequately block noise godsend use relax mode  worked  reading  m going complain anymore relax mode ca nt begin describe musical used  beats urbeats completely inear  negating need retune noise around  good blocking noise superhearing become necessary  remember jogging using zombiesrun  app definitely super hearing  office mode easily second favorite mode  loved trippy stuff   although ca nt imagine anyone using sleep mode would undoubtedly cause nightmares  lol   
never even got try one  last one used “ hear ” app  made post  still using wired earbuds  apps ’ work bluetooth devices  lag  suppose   honest  airpods made unnecessary  use combination ambient sound apps  music  noise canceling  happy cake day 
wow  list movie ones  know inception  phone running  ejdj different hear

second question  say  even works mobile  mobile would run different kind platform right  rtx cards real time raytracing thing  still legacy lighting older cards

rtx cards cards capable raytracing  raytracing techniques around decades 
reason feeling s simplified implementation  use  realtime raytracing lighting effects  buzz word days wanted clarity  lol  would also first vr game use rtx feel like would make bigger deal rtx feature 
ualbinobluesheep uwman37 like shanks said  nt use rtx  raytracing around long time s invention nvidia  amount raytracing need seems low even phones devices like oculus go  probably would nt worth development hours make utilize rtx  performance gains losses rtx card
yeah  tried last night  pretty good  bugs  steaming audio work  people could playing  also mic work crashed times 
http  lmgtfycom  qheadlessghostdongle
m technologically proficient people  nt know  thanks clarification 
yeah try running raytraced version quake 2 nonrtx cards  runs 1080ti 14  2080ti 
nt require rtx cards  raytracing old graphics rendering technique many use cases   latest implementation uses raytracing techniques stochastic sampling blue noise dithering  casts rays light big screen realistically environment  performance good enabling mobile vr headsets    x200b 
yeah  try join discord want get one one support  say multiple people audio issues right team already working fixing
use nvidia s apis  emulate missing functionality much slower  raytracing techniques nt use nvidia s new hardware features existed long time 
translation folks  ’ get stochasitic sampling blue noise dithering anyway  simply call raytracing ya  edit  reminds gdc talk youtube talked stuff like mega boost light fidelity game inside  go ’ interested 
ok cool  also posted steam page
yeah understand  may possible  s usable 
mean  much work use raytracing without rtx comparable performance  yes  s possible  rtx required raytracing  s disingenuous use rtx demo example cards able raytracing efficiently 
psa  steamvr nt changing audio automatically  uninstall nvidia s hd audio driver
changed something recently keeps windows seeing vive s hdmi audio appearing headset starts   open device manager  go sound  video  game controllers  rightclick anything says nvidia high definition audio choose uninstall   also sure check box says delete driver software device    click scan hardware changes  top  monitor magnifying glass   windows install generic drivers work perfectly fine  remember always  custom install  updating video card drivers uncheck hd audio option 
big thanks sharing driving crazy
uncheck 3d vision
thank  saw happening sometimes nt know exactly caused 
tech hero day    stopped using vive hdmi audio  thank fix 
well  issue ve got das  typically audio switches  wrong device  das two  usb audio hdmi audio  hdmi audio much much clearer usb audio  prefers switch usb instead  s pretty random  pick one 
use  voicemeeter   https  wwwvbaudiocomvoicemeeter 
work vive pro？ since vive pro multimedia really sucks  used prefer nvidia high definition audio 
nice one dood  really starting wind 
🎵 goes herooo 🎵 seriously though thankyou  driving crazy
thank  going crazy trying figure worked days others 
major problem  since exclusively use nvhda hdmi receiver  perhaps s problem since use 
thanks   also driving nuts last weeks  crazy workaround every time started play get audio work 
thanks
stop ever changing audio  set change still
thisthx   
thankfully nvidia finally dropping 3d vision next major branch  presumably 419 
disable one nt want use device manager 
good disciple  share gospel  voicemeeter 
really enjoy 3d vision  great lot games  movies  photos  know replacement  trying ditch completely 
nvidia s missing huge opportunity delaying one release
ll give shot  sometimes hdmi nt show  seems pretty random  restarting steamvr service tends make see hdmi audio  good lookin 
locate version tridef 3d ’ prior stupid subscriptionmodel version  continue work regardless ’ use 3dtv  despite salty 3d haters  looks phenomenal continue enjoy lot  watched ant man wasp fact lot fun   nvidia ’ persistence holding 3d support hostage display makers unless paid nvidia ’ exorbitant licensingwhitelist  cough  extortion  cough  fee  though sort tv manufacturerspecific support code provide  ’  standards frame packing  interlaced  sbs  ou  simply buffered alternating vsync ’ frames  ruined opinion nvidia ’ 3d vision  said  ’ still sorry see go  ’ aware many still use 3d gaming  let ’ forget nvidia ’ mtbs  meant seen  forums supported stereoscopic gameplay early stomping grounds catalyst many early discussion collaborations regarding development consumer vr  particularly ceratain someone  like ’ em hate ’    catalyst getting consumer vr ground  saying ’ gotten vr without mtbs forums anything like  play host many earliest discussions  anyhow  back particular topic  ’ also considered picking vorpx remains unclear whether supports adding sterescopic vr support titles strictly use within vr hmd ’ also used add support titles use stereo displays well  knew could use nonvr stereoscopy well ’ likely pick  edit  apologies op miniranting topic lol  kudos audio tip well  might solve related issues ’ certain games streaming audio steam link even 
think re trying ditch  quote    seen industry user base move newer forms immersive experiences virtual reality  focusing driver support newer technologies  proud supported 3d vision 10 years  launched ces way back 2009   418 branch continue get security updates april next year  looks like s 
ditching  might relevant  https  forumsgeforcecomdefaulttopic11017753dvisionfutureof3dvisionsupportofficialannouncementfromnvidia couple websites  follow one mostly 3d game fixes  https  helixmodblogspotcom
rant appreciated  3d stereoscopy still preferably vr number ways  eventually vr replace  mostly   may day pay tridef solution  ll probably roll back old drivers m ready play trine 4 3d 4 friends surround sound 3d projector 
screwed made deal trimon  dropped support emagin vr hmd  really cool headset time  abandoned nvidia could steer people new partner 
imo nvidia  tv makers  hollywood went way make money 3d gimmickry rather quality content  giving almost everyone bad impression 3d  gaming watching 3d pictures projector  hack get around nvidia s constantly updated lockdowns  great  never watched 3d blurays nvidia  mpeg restrictions  screen quality still better vive pro  couch multiplayer great 
welp add list features nvidia abandoned
def sounds like something ’  use gfx cards vr support primarily  wish competition stronger well supported due things nvidia 
audio shield dead    youtube 
random lame songs  huge bummer 
make playlist youtube songs like  get  youtubedl   https  ytdlorggithubioyoutubedlindexhtml  run command command prompt  changing folder youtubedl   youtubedl  extractaudio  audioformat mp3 o “   title  s   ext  ”  youtube playlist url  i replacing  youtube playlist url  playlist url navigate folder saved youtubedl ran command ’ find songs ’ perfect solution  works well enough
way restore youtube music streaming   s instructions   https  pcgamingwikicomwikiaudioshield  restoreyoutubestreaming   issue s youtube search way  basically top manually copy paste youtube s urls app  edit  noticed file suggests use   s download link downloaded    https  drivegooglecomopen  id11ghimzffs0rb7yfqyqemam6f5bfq2i7f 
wait  
nt blame audioshield nt music  youtube pulled plug audioshield 
use mp3 s instead
game support local files like audio surf 
yes
audioshield dead second vr rhythm games started using handcrafted beatmaps  autogenerated ones hot garbage  beat saber  airtone  audica  scatter  synth riders  etc infinitely better simply handmade beatmaps 
screw youtube 
play beat saber custom songs mods 
try  soundboxing https  storesteampoweredcomapp517130soundboxing  audica https  storesteampoweredcomapp1020340audica soundboxing ingame search option audica handcrafted songs like beatsaber
s necessarily legal   
’ way download previous version  ’ able fallout 4 vr  using steam console need like app id something 
removed year ago following legal threats iirc  edit  also reason ’ better beat saber developers ’ seen working supporting things like beat saver  reason still exists ’ relatively lowprofile 
idea  totally sucks though 
blame bullshit ip  rights  laws created corporate shills corrupt politicians
’ make sense  esp would ad revenue
zero songs pc 
people seem either deleted old mp3 s age music streaming never begin  still around 30000 songs hard drive fortunately 
lot vision trouble colors  beat saber stops song mess 
neither implemented  little work around  morals prefer buy music outright  ’ nothing stop  justify service free ’ access normally  already pay listen music another service 
guess case went court would considered spaceshifting  like dvrvhs  obviously nothing set stone  honestly copyright super date  noone consumers big companies actually want take things court set precedent 
oh yeah  remember thing   found guide   https  steamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetails  id1086279994   might give try tomorrow  ll let knowupdate find anything
aw s goddamn shame  rest peace audio shield   
soundboxing runs entirely youtube  nt trouble 
long nt actively try block promote beatsaver everyone wins
dude commented  legalthreat reasons  
never saw single ad audioshield youtube big fan embedding service applications way totally replace site apps 
well  rely forprofit entities entertainment  nt surprised cut back ways use services without paying  s million reasons manage music library  main one nt want beholden people  music labels  audio shield devs   lot people already given great technical advice  using youtubedl  etc  d give shot 
 deleted 
could use site like convert video mp3 https  wwwonlinevideoconvertercom
prefer audio shield beatsaber despite quirks 
turn “ fail ” mode  ’ litterally right click “ start ”
install customcolors mod set colors whatever want  turn  fail  option play without possibility failure 
oh awesome  ty 
 removed 
maybe umauionabreakaway said  maybe ’ popular enough yet attract attention relevant lawyers  audioshield problems either  fair 
 
rip game  s redeeming quality  wonder happen beatsaber 
ip  rights  bullshit strikes  maybe ll pirate old version
fun finding random songs know playing  works great friends round try  s  lost appeal somewhat 
maybe s whole point  liked game could jump  play random youtube song forget instead commit hard drive whatever 
s lot work tbh  decent amount songs  removes spontinaeity
beat saber support youtube 
try ty  turn directional slice 
nt audioshield  though 
doesnt audioshield add video feed 
wo nt  beatsaber s custom songs made modding community  legally responsible 
guess ll wait vr dance game thats probably cancelled  game company makes dancebeat ll limited library pay new songs  dance one subsription streaming service 
beatsaber maps hand crafted  installing mod  go bsabercom  search scroll custom music  kaiser youtube tutorial beat saber mods beyond simple  follow tutorial https  bsabercom
 arrows  modifier allows cut notes direction 
hope  guess re right allowing youtube meant direct liability feel beat saber knowingly allowing even actively supporting way use copywriten ip profit seems like something could become issue ay point 
modifiers come base game 
rocksmith diddoes thing much high profile product pockets worth sueing  long made attempt secure things  matter feeble  nt officially support modding music nt broken laws made reasonable effort  avoid issue 
yes  re options toggle start song

whats good bag travel case htc vive audio strap 
""
 original box stand das   https  iimgurcomkkzclv2jpg   costs nothing still boxes  lots padding  spaces small bits everything fits snug 
use  one   https  wwwamazoncomamazonbasicsdslrlaptopbackpackinteriordpb00cd778lc  carry laptop vr equipment s awesome  even carry light stands lighthouses  always careful lighthouses though  make sure nt receive hits front scratched 
pelican case  might bit overkill nt need move often 
amazon get really expensive  would recommend getting hard case customizablepluckable foam make fit gear snugly  use travel  https  wwwamazoncomdpb00ssfapvirefcmswrcpapiioaivcb69kmejh general home storage  got 40 dollar dslr camera backpack thick foam layer removeable padding  keep mind ’ travel flinging around  keep dust free  https  wwwamazoncomdpb002vpe1wkrefcmswrcpapiie5hvcbbkh59z0
unfortunately newer box older one
fit vive das  pictures 
ya far pluckable foam seems best bet bag pictures dac 
   https  iimgurcom1tsubc6jpg  new box 
yes  one rearrange soft separators attach walls velcro  pictures moment use mostly samsung odyssey  seen vive das backpack problem 
sure  ca nt see das strap photo padding strips going around basestations    x200b  black strip see going along gray part actually flips das hmd nt move around  also took padding strip wands better see laid    x200b  linkbox cables plugs bigger zippered pocket  various cables smaller zip pocket    x200b  https  imgurcomazzta6ah
correct
remember found chance 
looks even better old box  already divided  doesnt fit close das way 
found backpack  amazones  model one linked 
doesnt new box actually lot smaller original
seen vive dac inside
thats bummer  looks like could fit take das slide arms alongside headset  room stand 
friend s house  backpack  except different interior color   remembered das fits rotate headset kind inside das 
one  nt pic dac  s pic 3 trackers bunch mounts taking extra space  dac  controllers right less mounts fit  https  photosgooglecomshareaf1qipoounqywthdblqt9xd3ysarfjjtofsk3ogjo7rmmgcybt1ng8su3jpluwmxzqwphotoaf1qippswk8vqf1huactlcujbqxhdnf006wha6nj5w  keyohzba0dfcks2vxrwbvpovkjhvhfxwxnzvnzntjb3

audio strap save index controllers 
hey  hundred bucks  spend audio strap save index controllers  currently everything came vive box  enhance vr experience  help 
real games   index controllers   use  getting das best accessory got vive makes world difference velcro strapsuntil get great aaa games see need new hmd controls index pre order going bother 
deluxe audio strap  ll make hmd feel better wo nt mess headphones  making better experience  index controllers  cool new feature ca nt get vive controllers early tell developers support    x200b  since replacing hmd index  controllers right supported games many games issues  index controllers still using vive controllers many games  games like fallout 4 vr skyrim vr designed vive controllers touch pad far easier use vive controllers index controllers  awesome games support also map perfectly oculus games using revive  would save money games  keep mind well  type person likes new things  experience new things index controllers  think may save index hmd  probably index controllers    x200b  deluxe audio strap give anything new make headset comfortable little easier put  upgraded  best upgrade upgraded wireless  lot easier put adjust longer fiddle headphones  standard vive instead upgrade  going vive hmd foreseeable future  really must opinion    x200b  hard decision actually  really feel would better  neither bad decision  opinion  vastly different things one another  nt worry better 
audio strap   controllers expensive flawed  re spending mood suggest  audio strap wireless adapter  s game changer
word street hype  index controllers meh 
dac awesome  especially paired cotton vr cover face cushion  happily going wait next gen  price drop index 
index controllers amazing  ’ got work development  become bit widely available strongly believe new standard vr controllers  ’ got basically seamless integration existing software development  full finger tracking future  still gives buttons  plus ’ tactile feedback grab things  new controller hardware ’ follow basic design going making major error    good  opinion comes testing good 10 different various types hand trackers  index one would ever consider developing 
deluxe audio strap  definitely 
s toss  d say index controllers  especially play plan play games support finger tracking  s unbelievable difference makes  audiostrap also good bet though  massive improvement  think finger tracking worry droppingthrowing controllers trumps right 
someone neither  would go controllers  big part would nt want spend vive rather save upgrading index
index controllers shitstorm 
pavlov  blade sorcery  jobvacation simulator  onward  tiltbrush  climby  nope  totally games supporting  s also totally literal game changer 
thank feedback  actually blew mind mentioning revive  idea existed 
ok   300 bucks
ok let give peeps bird real function get 
disagree  ’ much better  300 ok 
ca nt drop wear properly  wo nt throw wall  re comfortable  physical thumbsticks  grip capacitive  need awkward toggle button  means weapons  weapons easier hold  put  throw  etc  s natural make fist shape  grip pressure sensitive  want properly wield spear polearm letting slide front hand thrust   s difference always hold fake pair clumsy hands forgetting nt using real hands  dynamic climbing game supports night day  talking going literally grabbing index finger  trigger  opening hand gripping like would irl  could go days  index controllers exciting part index live  taking yet another barrier full immersion 
lol  nt know ok end 
fair comment probably pick year going upgrade pc unless say hlvr coming fully supported boom got money lol
said ’ ok   300 bucks ok anyways  used  controllers fantastic  tried several recent controllers promise full hand tracking  index one ’ tried far consider realistic use  companies doubt iterate design  controller going forward use index starting point design controller 
yes already mod  like  nt think re worth  300
disagree value  anyways  help op  ’ think audio strap worth much  ’ like index controllers would still suggest saving controllers  ’ sure plenty index inspired controllers coming months 
definitely

vive pro wireless audio question
plug vive pro linkbox  audio drive nvidia high definition audio shows plugged available steamvr  works fine  switch wireless  shows unplugged  choices speaker vive multimedia  speaker htc vive  neither gives good sound quality  anyone know  s even possible  get nvidia sound option vive pro wireless working 
 ca nt  vive pro longer directly connected nvidia card  htc s wireless solution  really  intel usb 30 wigig wireless docking solution  usb 30 video card displaylink using displaylinkxr compression algorithm  frames  rendered  gpu  frame copied gpu s memory system memory  compressed displaylink via cpu tossed wireless usb  s decoded half displaylinkxr chipset  htc s wireless  using vive pro s onboard usb sound card  cmedia chip  iirc  wired using nvidia s audio displayport  using cmedia chip sound  displayport decoder ic  m really sure audio gets compressed wireless  would nt surprise either way 
would first ve heard saying difference sound quality options  noticed anything iirc get options wireless 
thank  ’ helpful understand  usbc port ’ pro  plug headset still using vive pro onboard sound card  wireless usb passed computer  meaning would driven system sound card 
welcome  usbc port vive pro using htc s wireless solution shares bandwidth everything else wigig wireless usb link   surmise  plugging headset simple treats headset usb headset  steamvr s audio menu allow select audio sink place vive pro s cmedia chip  s way usbc audio device route audio back vive pro s headphones  relying upon whatever usbc audio device outputs 
 theory  want improve audio quality software standpoint  usb c headphone high quality built soundchip answer  improving hardware standpoint pro would getting earphones actually seal ear ’ read  particular headphones would recommend 
particular  vive pro s work fine  ve still got umbilical  people luck 3d printed clippy thing adds bit tension vive pro s headphones hold tighter  regards headphones  d definitely recommend anything uses bluetooth vr  latency nt match screen  re going set cans  ll remove vive pro s headphones find pair fit comfortably hmd head  far headphones go  m fan sony  sennheiser  grado want open back  spend around  100 set  anything much bullshit fluff  anything much would nt able hear anything better blind test  general  avoid beats bose  overpriced quality  paying name cans

s lot goes good sound source  least headphone amplifier  stay away ” 51 ” ” 71 ” gimmicky headphones  nt actually anything built surround effect  comes headphones  two ears  need two drivers  fancy bs processing  put decent set cans  listen 3d spatial holophonic barber shop   https  youtubeiudtlvagjja   requires nothing good quality regular headphones hear pretty wild 3d  trick recording rendering    ” surround ” headphones  anything headphone says ” gaming “  something like sony mdr7506 m talking  give whirl  grado sr80e  also need way hook    need usbc headphone thingy  give shot first  using something like recommend  thing linked cheap usbc thingy linked  would definitely call upgrade  ca nt personally recommend one  would recommend asking recommendations  rvive  one audio subs  iirc  s headphone sub s pretty active

really bad buzzing sound mod mic vive  could use help 
hey  title says  m getting pretty terrible buzzing noise mod mic 5 bought use vive  ve learned get buzz turn controllers   mic pretty quite  soon turn controllers  buzzing starts  m plugging mic extra usb port top headset  m wondering anyone solutions experienced  thanks 
modmic 5 uses 35 mm jack usb header  must different mic  https  antlionaudiocomproductsmodmic5 interference audio devices normally caused voltage fluctuations power  perhaps wireless communication causing turn vive remotes  solution would use filter smooth power  plug different usb ports see separate 5v rail
s definitely modmic 5 use usb adapter  see m talking scroll page little bit  kind filter talking smooth power 
 audioquest jitterbug   https  wwwaudioquestcomjitterbugjitterbugusbdatapowernoisefilterusbdatapowernoisefilter   features  usb power filter
audio longer works one ear  og vive 
sometimes get come back based wiggling cable  must loose connection somewhere idea fix  nt headphones  work fine plugged directly computer  regular htc vive addons  anyone got experience issue 
happen twice  35mm audio adapter inside headset likely needs replaced  use thumbs slide front compartment cables attach ll see  recommend getting deluxe audio strap using wireless headphones instead
short audio adapter may loose inside headset faulty  slide cover  push towards front  check 
nt deluxe audio strap connect faulty adapter  thank 
deluxe audio strap plugs directly vices audio jack  right lenses
checked outside  m pretty sure bypasses adapter deluxe strap headphones plugs directly hmd port  also probably get replacement adapter htc ask kindly  deluxe strap definitely worth money comfort opinion 
even need buy strap  may well plug headphones directly hdm port 
try  adapter specialize plug recall may unable fully close face plate  s loose damage headset

audio setup
’ planning getting xlr microphone preamp compressor replace crappy laptop microphone  ’ curious setup could also hooked vive  anyone tried connecting vive preampcompressor 
s need replace vive mic  stick wind guard top 
nt think possible  vives microphone usb come asio drivers  plan get xlr mic also need audio interface good vst host  alternatively hardware compressor  sure use ingame since lot games use audio drivers mic making impossible change routing mic signal thru vst host first 
’ unfortunate  might get modmic replace vive microphone case 
yea mod mic certainly easiest option  hate mod mic s sound stage xd
’ issues vive microphone recently ’ welcome decent replacement

audio microphone solutions wmr headsets 
curious know kind headphones mic guys using  athm50xs ’ fit asus forced use earbuds 
use ear buds inline mic  cheapest  easiest solution  s true sound quality nt good ear headphones lower weight make longer vr sessions comfortable
bought odyssey  amazing spatial audio great noise reducing dual mic
use pair shitty earbuds snowball mic 
almost model  athm50x  use lenovo explorer  may add weight nt fit well  still comfortable sound quality great  feel way first  play 23 hours without problem 
pair sennheiser hd6xx mod mic fits headset s pain put take  debating pair decent earbuds lapel mic instead 
need mic logitech headset works  need sound use trusty sennheiser hd 202 s 
use skullcandy crushers  built mic

could use mod mic ear buds  ve considering ve debating ordering vive delux audio strap 3d printing mounts attach explorer  mic issue s holding back though 
difference mod mic lavalier lapel  3 times cost 
yeah still picks voice even im far   x200b 
hmm  put mounting point onto vr headset mic mic could definitely work earbuds  though mod mic cable rather pesky problem moving games 
mod mic magnetic attachment stick headphones lapel mic usually clips shirt  mod mic sort mimics mic headset  m sure s expensive  probably gamers love  hyped lot reviews  s really alternative market  s convenient m sure s 3x cost convenient  especially since mic cable separate headphones cable two pairs cables dangling headphones  sound quality  sound good  ve heard  5 lapel mics sound great nearly good mod mic 
solution static sound
problem  sometimes static sound  loud  acours  2m extention cable  didnt want use powered usb hub  sound could appears  sound games  im playing spotify background minimal volume  since static sound doesnt appears  hope helps 
might unicorn effect  always playing spotify background get loud noise regardless  make noise stop stopping spotify  sound  get start anything makes sound  setting playback another device back get rid noise  seconds minutes  solution use usb extension  order 31 extension ’ 08m see works  using ’ reach behind computer time connect headset 
solved plugging headset usb port controlled cpu  b450 gaming pro carbon  s two red type usb s say vr ready 
could buy usb 30 pcie card pc far know  problem happens bc insufficient power extension cable 
msi b450 pro motherboard  two usb ports controlled cpu still blue  two cpu  two chipset  ve got 4port pcie expansion card  nt issue initially hmd plugged  vr ready  ports  tried using 164  extension cable  bought  active  usb 31 cable  one repeater end  nt really help  oddly enough  plug pc powered usb hub  plug hmd hub works fine

thanks fot suggestion  headphones m using combo speakersmic  try audio got nothing   luck
yes  said  plugged  refering plugging headphones acer wmr 35mm jack  nt aware potential problem  look  thank 
even though s similar problem  seems s still unsolved  couldt find help  thanks help 
good thinking  try  yes  problem either using tv speakers  problem example  want use mic game like vrchat s garbage use pc one
ve tried   even  audio input nt even recognised connected  would even make difference 
yep  ve seen thing  nt want waste money something might even work  try going store ask test product
hello  thank suggestion  finished triyng said  1  uninstaling audio drivers  input output  2  turning computer keyboard  mouse vr headset without headphones  3  connect headphones  also 1  uninstaling audio drivers  input output  2  turning computer keyboard  mouse vr headset headphones  reinstalled necessary drivers  expected  audio never came headphones  though pc  s woth mentioning m using laptop  built speakers 
record  turning pc  headset already connected  headphones already connected vr headset made difference  though good thinking  thank sugestion 
ve tried powered usb 30 hub   one   https  wwwtplinkcomushomenetworkingusbhubuh700   audio issues gone  everything works normal   ve wasted money cheap split usb 30 cable  ones power usb male head  nt worked  ve read somewhere fixed problem somebody  ymmv   guess comes quality power delivered usb 30 motherboard ports  comes wmr headsets working correctly 
hmm  m taking shots dark tried going sound settings  right clicking laptops speakers  clicking  disable   m wondering hardware issue  know said ve tried different headphones ones physically plug 35mm port   recommend attempting use bluetooth headset rule whether hardware issue  using bluetooth headset nt ideal longterm usage acer headset wmr headsets require separate bluetooth adapter  often times bandwidth limitations result tracking issues 
tried  audio came anywhere  every audio option disabled except realtek usb 20 audio  apears vr headset connected   bluetooth headsets  ones would recomend  nt want tracking issues  preferable s dongle 
 every audio option disabled except realtek usb 20 audio  apears vr headset connected   wait  headset plugged usb 20 port   almost certainly problem nt hardware related  would nt go buy bluetooth headset  know anyone borrow one test whether s related wmr portal  driver issues  hardware issues 
nt anyone one  3 ports laptop 30 laptop hp omen 17an  install  realtek usb audio 20  drivers  even though 30 ports
audio headset 35mm jack
ca nt get audio hmd work  hp wmr headset  ve set  mixed reality portal running  options  sound device seems one hmd   realtek usb 20 audio  always says s plugged  case helps  headphones m trying plug hyperx cloud ii usually plugged usb sound card 
quick question  using usb extension cable  alot times headset work perfectly fine buy lose audio using extension cables  thats recommended use active cable  boosts usb signal  even 2 non active cables supplier work differently  like bought usb extension headset audio worked fine  bought son exact cable  amazon cables nonactive  wouldnt let audio work  tried cable computer thing  headset worked  audio  ended keeping cable let working cable  use wireless headphones anyways didnt matter 
ever worked  almost sounds like bad headset jack wo nt even detect anything plugged 
another pair headphones  preferably cheap ones  try  think cloud ii may issue 
mine nt work got powered usb 30 hub
get solving  m issue  acer wmr headset   could tell everyone 
 deleted 
nope  extension cable  s plugged straight motherboard io  gives idea give usb ports try  might pull strange miracle hahahah  edit  nope nada 
hey  zakic  quick headsup    alot   actually spelled   lot    remember   one lot   lot     nice day  the parent commenter can reply with delete  to delete this comment 
well got vr headset couple days ago nt worked yet anything ve tried 
borrowed pair earbuds s detecting plugged 
way seeing power problem without buying stuff  m bit hesitant buy stuff spending whole bunch vr headset already  especially nt guaranteed fix 
sorry  never found solution issue  sucked used headphones straight usb soundcard 
nope

3m usb extension amazon use lenovo explorer  funny enough december 2017mid 2018 worked fine  took break vr awhile  started playing summer  audio issues  play games fine every often audio explodes nothing loud static  others said  likely due lack power extension  powered hub fix tried yet 
tried active cable odyssey plus work  tried 10 foot cable work  got six foot cable work one usb ports  others 
hi  ut 2m  non active usb work fine  make sure last usb drivers install  also try different usb 30 ports motherboards one supply enough power  amps  vr
alright  people recommending powered cable hub  stated original post  using powered hub  powered cables could find far  silly long absolutely practical  also pretty expensive  ordered usbtester least know power delivery issue here gon na keep posted ve time testing
active cable trick  said  think easiest fix use different audio device
use active cable powered usb hub
h0i  would mind specifying cpu mainboard  wonder maybe bandwidth limitation  tho dont think run ryzen chip b350 board since ve done extensive reading topic tho  maybe im missing something
hey  admittedly mainboard nt exactly highend im running b350pcmate msi however 4 usb31 ports  one usbc  really nt issue  even  buy  using  powered usbhub stated linked original post  sadly nt solve issue  let know s anything think im overlooking tho  meantime  usbtested coming  check various ports extensions potential issues 
neevermind  tester  already high end  thing could find  meet requirements headset testing like goes window  love technology
hey  since im extending cable much using powered hub  trouble seeing powered cable would possibly better  however  mind explaining mean use different audio device  like  play back speakers instead  directional audio really nt something wan na compromise
 like said thanks ya input
sure  using gigabyte gaax370gaming 5 motherboard ryzen 5 1600 cpu  got six foot usb cable work red usb port  would work others  even tried increasing power output usb ports something figured would help motherboard supports luck  yet tried powered hub  active cable tried  cablecreation  long 164 ft   https  wwwamazoncomdpb0179mxku8  refppxpopmobapshare six foot cable worked  cable matters usb usb  https  wwwamazoncomdpb0082179qw  refppxpopmobapshare ten foot nt work brand six foot 
meant headphone port something
headset one headphone port  s obviously im using o cant really run headphone cord way pc well headset cables 
hp vr1000  headphones jack missing audio channels
recently picked hp vr1000  original wmr hedaset hp   noticed m missing audio played jack headset  m hearing music beat saber  example audio channels missing playback  hedaset connected running simple video chrome  audio redirected  realtek usb20 audio  device  turns headset   m exact issue  audio channel video missing  ve tried several things troubleshoot  without luck   redirect audio regular speakers  connected desktop   sound plays perfectly  connect regular speakers hp headset  sound plays perfectly  connect headphones regular speakers  sound plays perfectly  connect headphones hp headset  voice channel   experiments  concluded none equipement use malfunctioning  everything expect headphones  headset combination yielded correct results   must kind setting somewhere  ve already tried set default sampling mode   stereo  16 bit  48k  dvd    higher lower  disableenable windows sonic headphones  including excluding 71 virtual surround sound   yet  nothing    x200b  ideas resolve troubleshoot welcome
forgive silly question  sure jack pressed way  effects happen jack flush 
suspect bad contact headphone jack  ve strange issues 35mm jacks  playing one side  issues additional adapter headphones  filtering frequencies cable seated improperly   case speaker cable detachable  could try headphones 
yes  already tried reconnecting different headphones multiple times  also tried   putting fully  similar thing distant past headphones gameboy   connecting regular speakers  using 35mm jack    get right audio channels  pretty sure s 
initial thought well  seeing speaker work started rule  trigger try something else though  headset speaker  worked   speaker headphones  works  m going give current connection buygather shitload extension cables headphones try   edit  nope  daisychaining headset  speakers headbuds nt give sound 
another silly question  headphone extension plugged way connects headset 
unless completely miss point  headphones used   simple wired  jack  apple earpods  although ve also tried brands  extensions  earpods ending 35mm jack ve put  fully  jackconnector headset  far m aware  connector internally routed cable going hmdiusb30 ports desktop  additional connectors anywhere canshould able access 
brands applecompatible  vr1000 4pole ahj port apple earbuds going ctia  35mm adapter  ground mic rings switched  plug ctia headset ahj port vice versa  quieter may sound like channels missing  nt really know ground ring switched  plug headset regular speakers works fine likely nt mic input s always touching ground correctly happened similar situation  found helpful  https  helplongtailproductscomhcenusarticles207970396smartphoneheadsetstandardsappleiphoneahjctiaomtp might  let know
something today continue testing  sure find standard jack follows  anyone happens apple earbuds  could give try  m starting doubt whether ve got faulty jack port  regular speakers stopped yesterday well

m using extension cable  s new pc  maybe s motherboard issues though since new b450 boards bioscpu compatibility issues recently  yeah  strange  oh  noise horrible  blasts full whiteish static noise anytime sound playing  thought headphones busted 
yeah  s annoying  use usb hubs front pc plus extension cable hdmi back  gives couple extra feet  enough  ll probably invest hub near future

wmr  steamvr  sound cards  soundblaster ae7 
reverb owner  bought soundblaster ae7 yesterday seem trouble  motherboard onboard sound  realtek   ve disabled bios  ve removed drivers software related realtek  everything fine plug hmd  displayed  realtek usb 20 headphones  sound passes headphone jack hmd  removed builtin headphones  currently using pair headphones plugged soundcard  hoping soundcard would pass hmds jack 
 everything fine plug hmd  displayed  realtek usb 20 headphones  sound passes headphone jack hmd  normal hmd s usb sound device  pretty sure  realtek usb 20 headphones  refer mobo s realtek audio chipset hmd s audio system  100  sure though  sound getting hmd  check main windows 10 settings  mixed reality  audio speech   mixed reality portal running  switch headset audio   turning temporarily disable soundblaster output route audio hmd unless also  mixed reality portal running  mirror headset audio desktop  enabled   route audio hmd soundblaster  said   bit finicky times nominally works described  said  afaik pretty much usb headphone device like hmd s headphone  35mm port builtin  sound output device windows want use soundblaster output m pretty sure d need plug headphones directly like ve already done  nt know way redirect audio soundblaster usb audio subsystem  words  think way use soundblaster s audio vr connect speakers headphones directly disable aforementioned  mixed reality portal running  switch headset audio  make sure  mirror headset audio dekstop  
hmd s soundcard  since uninstalled realtek drivers probably took away ones well 
ok  thanks  idea s audio device  ve trying something impossible seems  headphones soundblaster 
wonder mirroring soundblaster output hmd would work  apologies already said  soundblaster audio far superior onboard d nice  reason using jack less wires  probably main reason feel agitated nt know something behaving expected  case though  expectation problem  
someone else indicated think s ve uninstalled realtek drivers drive usb sound  output reverb windows needs onboard realtek chip activated drive usb sound output  soundblaster card ca nt output  back  southbridge usb ports  s works 
note mirrored audio suffer minor delays compared seeing  experience 
think correct 
would high end motherboard fix audio static jumpscare 
asus rog strix x470f sale right bundled ryzen 2600x  currently 2600 cpu would nt much upgrade motherboard give power usb hub  d really like avoid external one  honestly m thinking getting eye candy fixing extremely annoying audio issue would seal deal 
lot gambling  general two meter non active usb extensions give problems regarding motherboard  get active one instead changing motherboard 
considered powered usb expansion card  already one  getting static issues changed hmd usb card nt happened since 
get wireless headset instead  would useful outside vr use well get rid problem 
d lot cheaper get pcie usb card  look amazon  lot reviews vr hmd owners saying workdo nt work  appear work fine   buying one helped lot wmr tracking issues case completely solved static jumpscare issue completely  even using unpowered extension cables 
happens powered card two powered extension solutions  really gamble 
find fix 
nope  gave four five attempts solutions worked others  guess ’ stuck short default cable  blurriness bug myriad problems probably sell o get rift index 
audio crackling max volume lenovo explorer 
hey everyone  ve troubleshooting issue past couple weeks popped got back vr month ago  ll playing game beat saber randomly audio turns loud crackling static loud enough cause ears ring  m using extension cables ve tried using different usb ports motherboard  issue seems keep randomly popping  help would greatly appreciated    x200b    testing possible solution   things appears working fine  1 reinstalledinstalled available latest drivers motherboard  2 swapped usb cable different port  far appears working nt audio issue past hour  ll sure update post anything changes 
sounds like kinda thing happened started using extension cables  know   solution use powered usb 30 hub  borrow one try see solves problem  m thinking mb nt outputting enough power usb 30 port  powered hubs expensive  payed  30 mine  d borrow one try rather buying one find solution nt work  allthough m pretty sure 
curious  recently  annoying  issue o  seems random  happens  closing steamvr  windowsmr apps restarting fixed temporary problem  seems software issue hardware one 
temporary solution  tried turning everything except headset max volume 
sadly nt one available try  m going try reinstalling drivers swapping devices around usb ports see help  thanks idea though  end another option ll definitely give try 
exactly thinking  wonder issue introduced update  reason would think worked fine updated 18091803  sure long ago last played regularly though could nt say sure update would ve indeed case 
sure quite understand  audio coming headset s audio jack  nt audio coming speakers adjusting volume nt affect hmd audio 
try also unplugging nonessential usb devices  stuff nt need playing vr like instance web cam  etc  try dedicate system wmr want play vr 
’ talking applications ’ running rather speakers  lots applications audio settings  turn sound application turn headphone volume way  ’ usually hear crackling depending headphones use  stronger signal start turning application volume turning headset volume might make gameapp volume higher volume noise 
things appears working fine  1 reinstalledinstalled available latest drivers motherboard  2 swapped usb cable different port  far appears working nt audio issue past hour  ll sure update post anything changes 
ah okay  see re talking  sadly adjust volume way makes crackling audio louder softer  entirely distorts sound effects software currently running provides  example  teleporting place place steamvr home creates loud distorted version sound effect  tell  apphardware audio balance nt affect issue ve experiencing 
issue m wondering logitech g710 keyboard hogging usb juice 
oh  well  ’ noise electrical interference  clue  happen different headphones plugged 
wondering  razer keyboard  mouse  mousepad use rgb removing playing steamvr games nt fix issue tested  m inclined think default usb drivers got installed windows 10 may able properly manage usb ports much power deliver 
yeah  able go reinstall available drivers motherboard included driver usb 30 controller since installed nt audio issue pop past hour half  ready call fixed yet though  working theory included windows 10 drivers nt able manage usb 30 controller mainboard well enough nt sending enough power ports caused audio distortion experiencing 
hmm figure changeupdate usb drivers 
hey started happening last night  previously working fine  everything connected used  suddenly hmd woke could hear crackling across room  restarted everything worked fine thought fluke  happened middle beatsaber tonight   fun  restarted played another hour without issues  searched case  continued updatesswitching usb ports 
went motherboard manufacturer s website found motherboard s support page  m sure go re talking laptop pc company like dell hp since may handle drivers differently  computermotherboard manufacturer 
believe issue caused usb port supplying enough power  make sure nt sharing usb controller devices plugged  actually knowing  depends motherboard  2 usb controllers motherboard look exactly re connected could keep hmd s usb controller devices plugged 
 s okay sort stuff  m surprised actual usb driver update available even surprised worked fix audio issue

recent update makes wmr crash try enable windows sonic headphones  without  reintroduces bug audio sometimes gets extremely loud nearly blows eardrums 
anyone else boat  ve tried powered usb hub never worked  always windows sonic fixed issue  m sol seems 
screeching audio problem trying extend cables went away never came back went device manager disabled usb port plugged enabling

keep vr sound headset desktop sounds desktop 
way vr sound directed headset  someone using computer time send output normal speaker 
look using voicemeter banana  change vr sound output separate mix
windows 10 choose device audio sent specific app  nt general  vr headset  choose send audio particular app running headet    x200b   https  wwwintowindowscomsetdifferentaudiooutputdevicesfordifferentprogramsinwindows10   https  wwwintowindowscomsetdifferentaudiooutputdevicesfordifferentprogramsinwindows10

hey thanks  found yesterday  mixed reality portal nt showing select

titles spatial audio 
love great spatial audio  remember vividly using rift   quest nt found title utilising  pinballfx rift cool effect made pinball table music appear coming top part table  nothing like quest version  red matter sound effects nt even stereo  try throwing object see localise using ears   surprising  double check nt anything wrong setup  virtual barber youtube works perfectly s binaural encoding    x200b  guess question  good titles spatial audio quest 
notes blindness spacial audio  definitely recommend 
racket nx
superhot s audio fantastic  spatial audio works surprisingly well even using headphones 
spatial audio utilized well elven assassin  duck orc s axe  connects w wall behind  sound convincing 
noticed spacial audio first contact shaking maraca  shook around head hear 
skybox  really lends whole theater  experience turn head away screen audio concentrated ear facing screen 
shadow point pretty great audio  moss

interesting  thanks tip 
 go back tomorrow listen closely  
yup  got ta use spatial audio ball goes portal tiles tell ball coming 
thanks  try  probably played since replacing faulty  mono  oculus earphones 
cool  still undecided kind game though  p
good tip  makes sense oculus would get right   think using “ mono ” earphones last time tried 
think oculus pretty clear developers importance “ good ” audio vr  guess would take effort implement  perhaps even trying keep audio streams sync multi user environment 
somewhat reluctant buyer well glad  enjoying hell coop  pvp

 ayuda  tengo audio después de instalar mi tarjeta de video nueva
gente  buenas  tengo un problema que está volviendo loco encuentro como solucionarlo  básicamente  compré una tarjeta de video  una rx 580 phantom gaming de asus  la instalé en la máquina  bajé los últimos drivers los juegos andan joya  el tema es que tengo audio  tengo el cable hdmi conectado un monitor sino una tele de 32  la cuál también conecto mi ps4  antes de meter la placa el cable estaba conectado la mother estaba usando la integrada para correr los juegos  el audio salía bien  cosas que intenté  instalar desinstalar los drivers de amd reinstalarlos por completo  usar una versión anterior  instalarlos sin el driver de audio de amd  instalar todo después encima instalar los drivers de audio del mother otra vez  hay caso  algo que noté es que pesar de que tengo instalado el driver de audio  aparece el mismo como dispositivo en ningún lado  adjunto imagen para que vean  https  iimgurcom5apyedojpg alguna idea de que más puedo hacer  será un problema de hardware  dios libre   por ahora tengo audio si conecto los auriculares los jacks de la cpu así que es de vida muerte  pero es lo mismo  graciasssss
la phantom gaming es de asrock  de asus 
pregunta amd suppory porque funciona  tambien al support de los que hicieron la mother 
tenés tildada la opción de ver todas las opciones de salida  tanto la de dispositivos desactivados como los deshabilitado  una vez sucedió algo parecido  era que la salida de sonido digital través de una r9 250 estaba desactivada  creo que sea ese el motivo  la solución  por las dudas pregunto
aparece tampoco si activás la opción de  mostrar dispositivos ocultos  en el administrador de tareas dispositivos  la reinstalada de drivers fue una instalación común una instalación limpia  sea  si hiciste algo extra aparte de desinstalar la version anterior  pegale una googleada  display driver uninstaller  fijate la guía de la pagina 
reinstalar windows fue lo único que funcionó  pasó lo mismo con una 570
como instalaste los drivers de la gpu  con ddu  lo del audio probablemente se solucione si entras la pagina de tu mother bajas los drivers mas recientes  ddu creo que remueve los drivers de audio tambien ahora  detalle  la gpu que compraste es de asrock  asus 
sí  tengo la cabeza tan quemada que estoy diciendo cualquier cosa 
tendré que intentar por ahí  lo que espero es que sea un tema de hardware 
fijé efectivamente está tildada 
los desinstalé desde el panel de control  pero voy probar con lo que linkeaste  gracias 
imagino que si encuentro solución voy tener que hacer lo mismo  un dolor de huevos  pero la verdad que tiene sentido  hace años hago una limpieza hay drivers de todo color instalados en esta máquina 
che  una pregunta  cuándo reinstalaste windows instalaste algún driver en particular tomaste algún recaudo 
instalé win 10 los drivers que traía ya el windows los instalé con windows update  excepción de el de la placa de vídeo que instlae los del cd  los actualices esos porque los más nuevos generalmente traen varios bugs  como tengo ganas de renegar creo que cambie mucho el rendimiento dejo los del cd listo 
audio para pc ps4
buenas gente como andan  la cosa es asi  yo usaba un tv para jugar la play para la pc tengo el monitor con unos parlantitos genericos  el tema es que ahora necesito sacar el televisor por una cuestion de espacio  asi que tenia pensado jugar la play tambien en el monitor pero necesitaria algun equipo que reproduzca el sonido  ya que estamos que tambien pueda conectarle la pc para tener un sonido mas copado  alguno hace eso actualmente tiene alguna recomendacion 
justo hace unos días hice un cambio parecido  ahora uso un monitor sin parlantes  generalmente juego con auriculares usb  compré unos parlantecitos genius usb pensando que servirían para pc ps4 pero resulta que el usb es sólo para darle energía los parlantes  si si tenes que conectar el jack 35 una salida de audio  en la pc jode pero en la play tengo que conectarlos en la salida del control  es un poco molesto pero funciona  la moraleja  averigua bien si es que vas comprar unos parlantes usb  en la ps4 tmb se puede conectar una plaquita de sonido usb  aunque se si todas 
entendí mucho lo que buscás  vos querés usar la ps4 pc en un sólo monitor  que todo el audio vaya un equipo de música  si querés andar desenchufando  necesitás un monitor con salida de audio  tanto el audio de la ps4 como la pc vayan por hdmi al monitor  de ahi los parlantes  pero  generalmente la placa de audio de los monitores son una garcha así que vas tener una perdida de calidad  sino  vas tener que andar enchufando desenchufando el auxiliar dependiendo de dónde lo necesites    x200b  hay home theaters  como muteki que es carisimo  por eso lo recomiendo  que podés enchufar todos los hdmis al equipo ese  despues el ht te da una única salida de video que va al monitor  entonces el switch de hdmi lo hacés desde el ht  como te digo  el unico que conozco que hace eso es el muteki pero es caro  quizás debe haber otros ht con esa misma funcionalidad  pero ni idea de precios 
estamos en la misma  posta  la unica diferencia es que yo tengo un monitor con parlanes incluidos  que dan mucho cancer  con salida de audio como muchas veces quiero escuchar las 2 cosas al mismo tiempo  lo que hago es tirar un cable de 35mm del monitor al conector del microfono de la pc  lo malo es eso deja un sonido de estatica que es bajo  pero medio insoportable  en fin  puedo ayudar mucho  pero estoy en la misma busqueda  asi que voy ir pispeando el post ver si aparece alguna solución agregaré yo lo que vaya averiguando 
si buscas algo que solo reproduzca sonido funcione en los dos  comprate cualquier auricular que sea apple ya que funciona el microfono de esos auris en la ps4  por lo menos en mi experiencia 
yo lo tengo conectado con una audiobox presonus que tambien la uso para grabar instrumentos boludeces pero fijate que seguro encontras placas de sonido externas mas baratas  buscate alguna que tenga 2 canales de sonido de entrada como para que puedas switchear con el botoncito le conectas unos parlantes  que mi la verdad nunca gusto jugar con parlantes  unos auriculares  yo ahora mismo uso unos akg k44 la verdad que suenan lindo  los tengo hace mas de 2 años cero problemas
ah oka  gracias por el dato  tenía idea de eso 
claro  pero el monitor lo compre hace 3 meses asi que da para cambiarlo aunque tenga parlantes  bueno veo si hay algo parecido eso lo de los switches  gracias 
dale  si averiguo algo te aviso tambien  gracias
termino de encontrar  esto   https  articulomercadolibrecomarmla763129519parlantetrustgaminggxt668tytanbarrasonidocontroljm   imagino que debe haber mas baratos  se que onda la marca  la conozco
sino deberías de fijarte algo como esto   https  articulomercadolibrecomarmla686297022switchersplitterhdmi20x34k2k1080controljm  quantity1   https  articulomercadolibrecomarmla686297022switchersplitterhdmi20x34k2k1080controljm  quantity1  metés ps4 pc ahi  la salida va al monitor  pero el audio también lo sacás por el splitter 
yo anduve buscando también fui para el lado de las soundbar  como la  lg sj2   https  articulomercadolibrecomarmla745273999barradesonidolgsj221160wbluetoothsubwooferinalambjm  matttool33095920  mattword  gclideaiaiqobchmiq5x84fl4aivi4erch1ddgideayyayabeglk2dbwe  quantity1   pero el tema siempre es la conectividad  ahi todo depende de si tenes la ps4 fat la slim  porque la fat tiene una salida de audio optico  pero la slim  yo tengo la slim pero voy solucionarlo sacando sonido del monitor la pc por medio de alguna placa de sonido externa basica como  ésta   https  wwwnecxuscomarproductos11520placadesonidosenteyexternags2400usb20  gclideaiaiqobchmigon2yjl4aivh4irch1zlqb9eaqyasabegjhfdbwe  para tener el sonido de estatica que mencioné antes 
si creo que eso es lo que mas va servir 
ah bueno  voy tener que ir por ese lado entonces  tengo una pro asi que le mando la salida optica listo 
ayuda con audio de monitor 
hola  tengo conectado un sceptre c24 144hz un motherboard aorus b450 pasa que en principio reconoce el audio que tiene el monitor luego  se sale  como soluciono  empezó pasar de la nada  en principio 
cambia otra salida directamente se corta todo tipo de audio  anduviste probando software nuevo  hace un tiempo steam link hizo un quilombo similar  espera que se corte  revisa la configuración de sonido de windows  pestaña de reproducción  fijate que la salida predeterminada haya cambiado  ahí fijate si podes deshabilitar la salida que hincha las bolas ya esta 
cambia al audio de la mother  conectado nada  xq el monitor va display port  que hizo steam  si tengo pero baje nada extraño 
deshabilitá la salida de la mother si podés hace una instalación limpia de los drivers de sonido  aunque asegura nada si el problema es un programa aparte   steam link es una app para viciar en celulares con juegos de steam via streaming local  en el medio te instala dos salidas una entrada de audio extras veces windows se olvida cual es el predeterminado  se manda cualquiera  en mi caso  cambiaba de predeterminado cuando enchufas un mic en algunos juegos particulares   es culpa de steam igual  los drivers de sonido siempre tuvieron esa puta costumbre de aquilombarse fácil 
anda al panel de audio deshabilita todas las que esten de mas  fijate que salida esta tomando al momento de iniciar esa app de steam deshabilitalo dejando solo el del monitor
audio control ps4
alguien más se le traba el audio cuando juegan con auriculares conectados al control de ps4  se traba tanto que se escucha nada casi
pasa que se corta cada rato  sobre todo en el call duty cuando disparas  cada tiro hace que se mutee el juego  pero le saco el auricular por 3 segundos se arregla  se si es un tema por la conexión bluetooth del control es que el control ya esta bastante viejo golpeado
