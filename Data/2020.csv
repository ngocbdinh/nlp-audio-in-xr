das  instead cutting koss driver fit  took leather cover speaker  stretches back fine   stretch inside foam padding side koss driver fits snug underneath  granted perfectly middle diameter  ’ close enough   ’ hot glue  know ’ cheap   plastic casing holds driver snaps back housing without issues  overall ’ lot happier sound quality  considerably better  disappointed overall das sound quality  ’ pretty satisfied  thanks instructions take apart installing new driver 
great  may attempt  das koss ksc75  also good friend excellent micro electronics 
awesome thanks  save case get time 
looks like excellent guide  thanks sharing  
mod today  took hour  maybe bit  sound clearer  better separation equals better spatial positioning  however difference day night  original das headphones bad since people say  least opinion  find bass better  still lacking  well guess good gets comes size price headphones 
nice  upvoted
nice work 
really appreciate tutorial  looks like good weekend project 
got koss today  going little work table begin mod  appreciate tutorial 
yes ksc75 drivers porta pro  case little bit different  nt know fits   https  i15photobucketcomalbumsa377nickchengehusejpg   https  i15photobucketcomalbumsa377nickchengehusejpg  possible 
thanks opinion  sound individual person  time  converted one side direct comparison tested das  moment  difference audible  meantime  installed additional amplifier  sounds even better bass  amplifier weighs 82g  s ok addition powerbank counterweight    https  postimgccrndjmg1k https  postimgccty1g8fzn
fun always remember  careful  rush  patient work thoroughly  let us know re done 
welp  rookie mistake  didnt check koss went process  left ear dead  assume dead arrival  looked reviews big issue amazon purchases  trying figure different route  report back 
right one works far  already installed  make sure original koss  recognize fake  https  webarchiveorgweb20160427184342http  wwwkosssoundmagicdeserviceportafakeportafakehtml

pretty sure could add enough shit game boy pocket bigger 
h3vr  takes shot  headphones     kathump   
plugged headset s audio port  problem loudness  audible noise floorhiss 
used massdrop hifiman he4xx  3d printed parts koss portapro mod  much gorilla glue  looks super bulky cables mess  get actually super comfortable  comfortable portapros ask  always felt super flimsy  sound great 
nt know rift made lenovo 
“ lenovo ” 
glad valve index best speaker
ve using sennheiser 599s vr headphones  weigh basically nothing sound great 
well damn  idea could even get planar magnetics  200  hell happen   use beyerdynamic dt770 pro 80 ohm s quest without amp sometimes happy volume  odd cause re barely loud enough dac lg phone   tell  kickass dac    really opened eyes    assume planar magnetics would lighter standard set cans   s weight  always assumed earphones would best  ve got added benefit light headset  weight head top quest  added counterweights  seems step wrong direction  always thought iem s would way go  thanks much post  really opened eyes audiophile s clearly lost touch  ve always wanted planar magnetics since audeze brought consumer market  find way drive properly quest  find funds lmao  weight obviously issue since settup re posting  ve tried quest  preferably one s balanced counterweights  d love know think weight head  also experience iem s  thanks  hope hear back  real glad someone else high quality sound high quality gaming 
also help fact look headset wants come 
feel pain s worth  samsung hmd headphones volume unbearably low  knowhow d 
ve turned star wars sith mask  ll see 
much clamping force keep head  instance  look lot  use lcd2 s rift sometimes  stay ok  annoying lot vertical looking around  immersion insane tho 
bought high quality ears  want demo  stock speakers fine 
audio expensive headest
cool  human  alternate lining eyes vs lining ears

ca nt believe hifimans  waste  rift obsolete 2 years 
 deleted 
surprisingly heavy  least enough bother lol
dance 2020 ported wii vr 
would heavier say  football helmet 
 insert pic black man thick neck 
ca nt even play gameboy pocket without clip light  screen magnifier  external speakers  comfort grip  joystickbig button addon  rechargeable battery pack  gameshark s
could notice
normally ppl say issue  pushing bit way 
sound  neutral 
used set he400s back day  fantastic set headphones  open back way go vr think 
oof  could nt 4xxs  time favorite pair 
 deleted 
 deleted 
first thing thought  mean  solid mod undoubtedly better sound stock rift  op handiwork top notch  thank god bought index  might cost upfront  least nt need break glue 200  headphones get decent sound  still cant mod index comfort though 
really  tried hd 598 se  body hd 599 afaik  seem good fit halo band  wearing band wrong  tbf  keep experimenting different positions halo band  ’ quite found optimal position yet  got koss ksc75 also potential modding path 
dac gives clean sound  s converter  amp part whatever drives volume level  shit dac  big amp  loud staticy sound  good dac  small amp  quiet clean sound 
ya shit tier gaming headphones  proper  good quality headphones
id rather better optics better audio  bow  exactly elegant solution  eh 
ill take better visuals audio day  decent headset sound better cv1  thus waste  mod  cv1 get anywhere near visuals rift 
curious much weigh compared old hifimans  headphones alone strain 
m wondering  sit even comfortable center mass shifted bit back 
next hifiman aryas  report back 
oh yes meta pod hardened 
one  knows
audiophile grade headphones  sound wonderful   speaking someone s primary headphones hifiman 4xxs   headphones dropcom exclusive version hifiman s 400i  originally  500 pair headphones   drop price normally  180 
sound great  super clear accurate  flat sound profile  im huge bass freak thats fine  nt cheap headphones would hope sound good  im happy
headband already breaking mine nt mind
despite giant look feel nice light
oh  somewhat explains existence  augmented reality smartphone   https  wwwlenovocomusensmartdeviceslenovosmartphonesphabserieslenovophab2propwmd00000220 
yeah  takes finagling light  modding  get everything sitting right  stuck one adhesive rubber cable managers back portion tightening knob ve removed stock cable management clip getting way  put rift give cable slack rubber cable manager arches portion halo ear try maintain arch  extend headphone band limit plug cable rift s audio jack  put headphones  start placing  goggle part jack head  slide headphones toward ears try nestle halo  cable sit nicely top ear cup headphones release slack  works brother pretty different head shapes  used use pair audio technica clipstyle headphones  fit well remarkably clear  disappointed low end  clipstyle headphones seem going away  good ones remarkably hard find    edit    looked 598 se looks like band differs slightly padding  could nt work 
right  thinking would look like power cans quest portable dac still untethered  looks like hifimans nt terribly hard drive s good 
s interesting pulling apart gaming headphones finding weights glued inside make heavier illusion quality  thin plastic construction sh  drivers
going use gaming headset something like  even though built akg audio odyssey plus great   would probably use sennheiser headset  currently use pair gsp 350 s flat games listening music pc

want strap open back audiotechnica athr70x onto index
way
using amp  using mine without sound good re loud even max volume

thanks great explanation put  ’ definitely gon na give another shot  armed knowledge  stock cable management clip  gon na try removing suppose  soft cable tie attached back part headstrap  also guide cable back  quite essential  yeah  ksc75 clipons also sound pretty good  similar portapros   gon na end testing two different options making mind best sound quality comfort ratio  bad exact name senns  misremembered  actually hd598s   r    indeed seem near identical framebody 599 
could always grab 10000mah battery
impossible tell difference 80hz 90hz low persistence  getting full blown oled experience hmd  pure blacks cant used cause black smear  get massive sde thanks lack 3 sub pixels  find biggest immersion killer vr 
wear r70x rift  highly recommend  excellent audio sooo nice vr
yup  originally fiio e10k  sound blasterx g6  despite resistance rating  definitely want good  low impedence output amp 
x2 s  clarity terms fun signature  soundstage comfort  specially prices going days 
 deleted 
holy shit  sound blaster still around  make something actually respectable 
144hz monitor  vr 80hz perceived smoother  people estimate low persistence  black  oled  pixel  cant done hmd  low persistence  results black smear  hence  dont get black  oled hmds  yes darker lcd  lcd vs oled vr debate likely never end  comes preference   nicer  blacks  less pixels  still needing hardware render full resolution panel panels  aka pretty much wasting  compute  quest oled  higher resolution rift s yet rift looks clearer  less sde  running lower resolution  cant see sde cv1  mean  likely best judge things  would suggest checking eye sight  physical ipd set  cant notice sde cv1 
software could use work s passable  creative putting pretty good dacamp units past years  specific one really good performance  held back external dacamp  standard usb connection nt provide enough power  combined high impedance headphones distortion higher output levels 
 deleted 
mean  cant see sde rift cv1  either lying something wrong  pretty simple  ya  contrasts different oleds  tiny bit richer  biggest pull people blacks  makes dark scenes  even vr  million times real  feeling  read mate  said rift looks clearer  lower physical resolution panel  thanks lcd  low persistence literally key pillar vr even anywhere near today  ill take never tried dk1 lol  true  ill take device needs less compute  results better visuals  hence keep stable fps way better higher resolution oled uses compute  yet results worse visuals 
 deleted 
im weaving barley related points  im stating pretty clear points seem able refute 
 deleted 
point yet refuted lol  agenda  guy claiming cant see sde rift cv1  mean  come kiddo lol  high end hmd  makes perfect trade offs  reach price point promised decades tech  quest great mobile solution  big players looking standalone hmds new snapdragon chip  see things destroying quest soon standalone  massive issues mate  sorry tell 
 video  quake dev talks activision didnt think anyone would buy game needed dedicated gpu  sound familiar 
""
still break q2 nostalgia  quality game 
fair gpus became popular due vastly superior looking games coming prerequisite franchises die hard fans  something could plug without worrying  adopted slowly tech leads really pushed developers able add fancy graphics without worrying much performance baseline dedicated gpu much faster came carefree upgrade save power requirements perhaps  vr requires lot comparison top spec requirements  need large play space  maybe extension cords vrcover  good bluetooth wireless full body tracking need spend lot even wo nt fully use except games  hassle go wireless put weight every extra accessory takes away ease use  vr also nt revolutionise s already  s entirely new way interact digital world  atleast new mainstream user  nt realize re missing s easy exhibit without seeing  unlike fancy graphics gpus brought table easily marketed  nt think s fair comparison reasons vr becomes common consoles ll unique experience offers versus flat screenmousejoystick content ease usereachability masses  headsets us  well pricing immersion increases amount users  sorry formatting  mobile 
nice little tidbit  halflife came soon titles  also needed gpu 
lol game made 2x voodoo link mode
well dedicated gpu enhances see  completely changes nature  popularity vr heavily dependent comfort re nowhere near close enough match playing console game couch 
remember buying voodoo card quake  totally worth 
facebook  samsung  microsoft valve invested vr years  nt think vr undergrounddead  narrative people love counter even enough basis reality warrant posts calling attention cotrary 
remember buying first voodoo card play half life  m buying 2080ti play half life 
s poor comparison  gpu nt require wear facehead  worry whether s tracking correctly  worry whether batteries low controllers  worry sweat  pain  heat  discomfort wearing  enjoy vr  s much bigger commitment currently  owning piece hardware put inside computer forget 
yip  imagine ppl saying failure  likely even born 
think oculus starting move towards mixing ar whole vr ecosystem think  like said  hard explain show  someone vr  even people vr  dont know  lets say  alyx like headset  guess ar lot easier show   thus might crutch vr grows 
surprising considering halflife built licensed modified quake engine 
 bought half life launch day  ’ require gpu  option use gpu  ’ requirement  options software  glide  opengl rendering  ran without problems gpu  good fps 1024x768  common time  
discredits sub blatant factual misstatements like get upvoted 
isnt true  hl well quake 3  never required gpu  actually think arguable one reasons quake 3 nt succesful decision  actually ceded huge amounts quake playerbase halflife time  course  lot reasons  mostly tfccounterstrike mods  still 
nt enhance capable rendering information presented allows larger better experiences  vr exact type change different approach change
think mostly people edge diving  would rather reverse justify  rather accepting  reminds gpu age ton  never needed gpu  got  sat nothing day  every single computer  gpu constantly using multiple displays etc etc
s forgetting  gpu  market time  really mess precise list dedicated graphics card games work properly 
right think experience provided headset enough incentive people buy care headset 
great comparison  heat old gpus use pump use turn room oven  seem issues tbh  good headsetstrapetc hmd feel like even head  cause 0 pain  fan directed right   hmds ways air get inside 
 worry whether batteries low controllers tell conventional controllers still powered electricity 
top vr need dedicated gpu whole vr kit 
yeah  microsoft even pushing ar aspect  wmr windows mixed reality  think inteded mix vrar one first generation ended vr save holo lens  fully pushing ar ignoring vr aspect  think time mean mix together ll need really high quality cameras sci fi visor turn transparentopaque switch arvr demand  assuming former ll take time headset affordable enough mainstream  think fact vr manufacturers switching inside tracking also supports  making portable headsets iterations could turn arvr smaller form factor better mobility 
yip  crazy think  stuff like dota dna quake deep inside 
water effects running software mode 😗👌
require  mean solid experience 
factual 
hl much needed gpu  software  rendering mode horrible fps  way could use  cpu god like time  either god tier cpu  bought gpu  quake 3 massively successful time  lol  https  enwikipediaorgwikiquakeiiiarena  reception goldsrc  call original hl engine  way robust  way features started  quake engine   lot moddable easier  reason mods general audience clumped hl 
bullshit man time q3 came pc gamers dedicated cards 
s really  though  video cards  went looking pixelated screen looking much less pixelated screen  sure games could display  within boundaries screen  vr   game requires wearing good deal equipment using fullbody movement control character  large gap two types experiences latter surely continue issue vr gets comfortable enough endure  even contend people s general preference take environment entirely 
s totally fair comparison  think disingenuous suggest  sub seems  somehow missing nt getting early  reality  better cheaper options great games com later  earlier  like era gpu new  many people justify extravagant purchases even see value 
time quake 3 came  things much less crazy confusing years earlier  direct3d opengl starting properly work  fewer fewer games released 3d support coded specific chipsets  like rendition verite glide 3dfx voodoo  
s always case want run cutting edge stuff  mainly 3dfx nvidia back 
s comparable buying new console  even worse  buy new console  high end gaming pc 
sorry consumers zero patience aftermarket modification kind  either works perfectly box  nt work  vr still firmly enthusiast market 
 deleted 
right days dedicated gpu s standard gaming computers  nothing like back 
almost every modern game traced back doom one way another   game quake 
keep using word  ’ think means think means 
talking  worked fine software mode 
making definition  required  means 
played halflife cyrix mxpr233 without gpu first came 98  well quake 2 97 3d accelerator required  edit  take back  diamond stealth s3 virge card  lacked opengl support  d3d ran worse software rendering  play software rendering 
quake 2 absolutely require gpu  neither original halflife  played using software renderers  yeah  might get 24 fps run 320x200  normal time 
questioning whether around read things 
sounds like werent alive time 
trying defend ceo m agreeing  s type jump different approach nt even mention impactful agree vr significant jump graphics cards nt pixelated less pixelated introduction new effects detailed models overall complete change approach much headroom vr people changing approach development much done 
true  point vr  time starting make sense buy  headsets getting costs people pretty much wanted  since dawn age vr  300400 magic price point  believe people wanted wernt even thinking controllers standalone unit  bonus  setup super easy compared  right  could way  due way things room  set external sensorsarrays etc  inside tracking  enough space  would better course  like saying bigger monitortv better  course  also  messing around asw bit  pretty clear even underpowered systems could run experiences  course asw never good simply hitting set frame rate  insanely good  could easily run experience half frame rate   aka halflife  alyx likely   honest  besides random glitching sometimes happens  dont even really notice  actually seem feels looks smooth  moving controllers clearly shows running half rate though  visuals feel smooth clean  things together  make feel like going sort leap  anytime soon  besides stuff course always better  like resolution panel frame rate etc  waiting  either waiting good 24 years next massive leap every engine gpu supporting foveated rendering hmds good eye tracking  hmds cameras mounted look mouth translate onto avatar etc varifocial lenses etc next 24 years  going headsets much like ones  standalones powerful quest  hmds higher refresh rates resolutions 
headsets halos work box terms comfort  whole point thread  playing game like quake  hardware  also enthusiast market  things like halflife came  leap terms everything  term birthed people getting gpus  gpu market general 
hmm  sounds similar gpus first came 
assume pain  talking physical  sounds like using quest  im brushing issues anything  issues solved solved hmds  like physical comfort airflow  seem silly point  visual vestibular stuff  agree  new vr  going mess sure  could said 3d games general started getting popular  ppl cant play fps games due motion sickness issues  reason third person games common  people adapted could handle 3d games  take lets say  someone never played video game  get play fps monitor  experience oddities  much like vr days  brain  literally never seen something  needs adjust  started vr years ago  fake movement would kill  days  cant make feel sick strange   even try  content totally agree  whole point alyx  going set new standard  devs match  using source 2 create game  thus inherit 90  codebase etc halflife  games  let alone fps games  let alone good ones   match standards  made future games amazing  people adapt thing really say  didnt really people tinkering inside pcs much gpu age  poeple use take pc store gpu installed etc 
yes  people ’ gaming computer ’ additional barrier 
would disagree  games made unity ue  created scratch 
s nt like john carmack announced leave oculus  hope nt fuck without john 
 https  youtubepmidaomx0ga  t253   https  youtubepmidaomx0ga  t253    x200b  definition old man  know right  
 nope  simply using context      computing  something required  doesnt mean software simply open dont said requirements  simply getting solid experience creator intended 
hmm  people seem think require  mean game open  never case computing  require  mean solid experience  could run current vr pentium 1gb gpu  hence  current requirements  incorrect standards  dont silly lol 
require  mean playable 
feel like talking mirror mate  got game wrong  seem think software render hl2 playable common cpu  claimed quake 3 successful  one successful games time  hl  claimed hl successful due mods  agree  mods increased longevity  one key goals hl mods  quake afterthought  longevity key  yet get game  vr  moddable  easy mod  hl  hl2 lets say minecraft  hl  
18 time 3rd 4th pc 
good points  nonenthusiasts always waiting killer app  nt enough polished material think  especially social experiences multiplayer general  schpeal inspire consider rift hl  alyx  saving index better pc without ever used vr hard compare experiences meaningfully 
yeah overall point holds think  got gpu play halflife better  software renderer great  ran poorly  thats story 
s vr issue  dedicated gpu makes gaming general lot harder  many games wo nt even run properly without dedicated gpu 
apex legends runs modified version source  derrives goldsource  modified version quake engine 
using many concepts design lessons doom quake engines  engineering point view unity could argued derivative work  copyright point view used completely different source code base 
literally addicted talking ass 
redefining word requirement     
 never case computing   s entire point video posted  quake 3 would open pc 3d accelerator supported opengl 
assume also using custom definition  playable  well  given halflife quake 2 completely playable software renderer 
played software q2 pentium 2 ran fine 
q3 succesful relative expectations intents purposes  death franchise fall id generally   even link proves  quake 3 supposed rock industry  instead got absolutely smoked halflife marginal title  think 3000 concurrent players peak relative halflife s 50000 hl software renderer  quake 2  worked pcs  games running modest frame rate sback  even got riva tnt play halflife would often run 1530 frames many scenes  performance expectations quite different  whole point video linked quake 3 launched without software renderer  even though every competitor still included  say halflife  quake 2 etc required  gpu flat wrong  gpus didnt even exist first geforce  released well q3test 
hmmm must bad memory 
right  ’ talking people ’ pc gamers  barrier entry pc vr quite high 
ok  single game thousands lol  aka said 
 using many concepts design lessons doom quake engines  mean  re digging far  might well say doom roots pong  pong roots calculators  re picking arbitrary lines draw 
guess  little  way current modern engines work  nothing like doom quake 
seem addicted going profile upset  oi gosh  tell  engine widely used today base games 
nope  simply using context  computing  something required  doesnt mean software simply open dont said requirements  simply getting solid experience creator intended 
hasnt  pretty much always able open software system requirements  cant expect work perfectly 
playable subjective  course people fps snobs back day  compared  days  things called lans  popular  people use gather often computers  common sight see games play  running million times better someone elses system  thus  almost making unplayable return system  world different back mate  nothing like kids grew experienced today last decade 
actually 3dfx voodoo1 2 gpus  graphics processor units  support 2d accelerated graphics advanced 3d technology shader units introduced geforce1 cards  feeling old first sli gaming system matrox millennium 2d card dual voodoo 2 cards could play hl unreal 1024x768 16 bit colour  today oculus quest feels every bit revolutionary voodoo1 card felt quakegl need speed 2 3 
like said  reason halflife could grow keep playerbase  modding aspect  course got smoked halflife  partly whole thread  halflife alyx going halflife  vr  sense halflife game  also halflife games  set new stands push medium forward  talking working   software rendering common cpu hl released  released sub 15fps  yes people back fps hungry today  still clearly sub optimal experience  resulted people getting gpu  ppl using bit success  would people top line cpus  means clearly invested computers already  point video publishers understanding direction industry moves  much like today  helps point  biggest explosion ppl entering vr  investing  going alyx released  people see top tier vr experience  ease spending money better gpu cpu headset  becomes trivial 
https  enwikipediaorgwikiiwengine pretty much every call duty  think main series titles  nt confirmed  uses modified idquake engines  whose lineage directly traced back doom
gaming technology derives abacus 
long time fps games referred doom clones  5 plus years   never hear 3d fps shooter described pong clone  least   
nope m reading one single thread everywhere  sitting nonstop bullshit  even say something correct time time  tell s happy accident 
seem required equipment confused recommended equipment 
requirement  computer sicence terms  know  topic hand  means something work without required entity  minimum requirements game tend extremely old video card even aaa games  older  video cards even boot game 
 nope  simply using context    context case video referencing quake 3 required 3d accelerator  software fallback  halflife software renderer 
think re pretty confused  back day bought first dedicated gpu  game literally giving popup telling would nt open gpu detected 
well  s obvious nt person 
dude  reading replies thread  s way m buying older kids

still think audio beats better beat saber 
feels polished  music way way better  plus traditional arcade rhythm game feel  think missing barriers tbh s enough variety nt really need barriers  guys think  https  storesteampoweredcomapp570860audiobeats
like beatsaber because s traditional arcade rhythm game  beatsaber really struck gold idea using lightsabers feel great vr  feel even better well made 360 levels  really get moving   also think slashing works better shielding  boxing shooting rhythm games  s like opinion  man  
looks quite complicated  quite like beat saber s quite easy game tounderstand  prefer synth riders though  game super fun 
ugly music way better  excluding custom maps  really nt played beatsaber since ost maps pretty poor comparison well made custom maps 
better music  almost think beat saber know song  tf talking 
nt played either beat saber certainly looks fun  would see plays better idea fooling around couple light sabers seems appealing m huge rhythm game fan 
would nt say s better beatsaber play beatsaber lot  definitely potential said s lot closer traditional arcade rhythm game  really wish d kept working 
custom songs 
think audica better 
thing hate reddit  whenever someone says something slightly controversial  like  fave videogame something peoples fave   get massive downvotes  nt think makes sense directly compare two games  since  see  aim different things  audio beats pure rhythm game  beat saber much pleasure smashing stuff lightsabers  think audio beats sounds pretty fun  s wishlist 
yeah played audio beats 
well part music  music sets whole mood game  music way better  like proper rhythm game 
ve done modloader  whole shebang  maps better custom maps ve seen beat saber 
s mapping  graphics variety make interesting patterns go thee music 
mean like one  even though guy sucks playing   https  youtubepdnlhctsn94  t1260 s good memorable songs like beat saber   game feels incomplete  except   100 bills   actually like one 
custongs       bleepbloop  m bot     portmanteau   https  enwikipediaorgwikiportmanteau    created phrase custom songs       faqs   https  wwwredditcomaxl72o        feedback   https  wwwredditcommessagecompose  tojamcowl  subjectportmanteaubotfeedback        optout   https  wwwredditcommessagecompose  toportmanteaubot  subjectoptoutrequest 
nope s 12 songs  excellent  currently trying figure extract soundtrack 
audica sort different category  compared pistol whip better 
yeah s mean s better people looking good rhythm game  knocking beat saber  s good certain people 
beatsaber 1000 custom songs available  sure played 
think s subjective  really like country rounds  escape  level insane  legend  unlimited power   burning sands  angel voices  pop stars  fitbeat  cat  exit earth atmosphere  need  rum n  bass entire linkin park pack 
search tutorial custom songs game good u play songs u want
means thah music actually way worse beatsaber 
ones tried trash went straight list songs people said best 
pop stars favorite beat saber  blows away  actually problem songs beat saber re random  s like soundtrack movie game  nt feel like re progressing 
okay   first custom songs liked ones saw  youtube channel   https  wwwyoutubecomchannelucc86vxyz3kmqgbg3tmtrogvideos   really like songs encourages full  solid slashes  like guy vids  always try make solid  forceful swings getting heart pumping  even though s edge sabers  always aim hit edge  one would real sword  nt played audio beats  sounds like pure rhythm game  whereas beat sabers works like mix sword sim rhythm game 
watched think main difference audio beats musical  watch beat mapping  s way complex anything get beat saber  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vpdnlhctsn94  featureyoutube  t1810

surround sound speakers vr
headphones headset  rift cv1  longer work properly ’ using surround sound speakers  works great ’ facing forward second turn sound front coming different direction  way make sound match direction 
would nt easier buy wireless earbuds  think sorround sound would use sort plugin oculus  hard coded game  doubt anyone much effort either 
would need spacilized 3d sound system sort head orientation tracking system like work  surround sound always assumes looking one direction  forward screen  take account turn around   thus changing forward   need piece hardware software 
nope  mainly simple reason 999   probably  vr users use headphones earbuds many use full 51 system bother additional hassle something small market 
already speakers room vr bluetooth computer much latency sound plays second delay

wireless headsets produce spatial audio hardwired ones 
rifts looking wireless headsets  tried koss 3d printed mount ok want something better  decent set audio technica headphones cord super long removable  m looking razer thresher headset s rf wireless set good mic  still get spatial audio tell something behind wireless headset vs one plugged rifts 35mm jack 
yes however watch latency  s gaming headset guess ll fine d double check sure 
vr s  spatial  audio software works stereoscopic audio  wireless otherwise  long head phone carries proper channel  left right   mixing  audio simulate location done software 
tried bluetooth headset yesterday advice  soon rift running  massively interfering bluetooth connection  guess controllers  leads poor reception  resulting variable latency like half second worst case  dropouts  sure get low latency connection  probably even dropouts 
ya reviews read thresher said latency great uses rf dongle instead bluetooth 
bluetooth aptx low latency pretty common  experience transmitter headphones  search favorite store aptx bluetooth headphones 
awesome  thanks info 
alter bluetooth services windows improve qualitylatency  s lot redundant bluetooth audio services removed quicker response  also helps bluetooth 50 connection better latency  depending headphones bluetooth version  ofc  
go  bluetooth also rf course reviews probably mean proprietary solution  software pipe audio headphone s audio sink wo nt lose detail 
 headphones bt 41 doubt overcome interferences hmd  though 
open  devices printers  windows  rightclick bluetooth device select properties   click services tab uncheck stuff nt need  ie  audio wear  handsfree telephony  remote control  etc  etc  improve bandwidth sound quality  interference  nt issue rift bluetooth headphones  possible bluetooth dongle nt strong enough 
 s meant  yes  disable stuff already  yes  rift definitely interfering  tested thoroughly 
may want try stronger bluetooth dongle computer  m using anything special  works rift 
may depend headphones 24g antenna  need anymore got rift replaced working headphone jack  short cable perfect

loving  one little quibble  m left handed  prefer shoot left hand  ve also spent lifetime playing video games movement tied left hand  stands  want left handed shooting  use right handed movement  s fine either teleport options  free locomotion d prefer option move shoot left hand  m sure s lefties boat  eventually ll add discussion page steam hope gets implemented  till guess ll teleporting  even minor frustration  s best couple hours ve ever spent vr game 
absolutely epic  however wish could continuous smooth rotating right joystick  snap turning thing urks  maybe future patch 
spent good 10 minutes beginning using dry erase markers draw windows 
idk  s great game far  imo vr beginning games like onward pavlov bow games  god  many bow games  today games like boneworks twd saints sinners alyx wo nt blow socks 
blown away far 
locomotion  reason never played first person games vr 500 hours vr flight sims 
yeah  play like 20 minutes time gpu crashes blackscreen  thanks radeon  much appreciated 
hl 1 nt feeling horror game  tbh  hl2 parts  long time start  hla  aaahhh  1 hour  dead zombies  eeeehhh    take brake  great game  spend much time first rooms  
condolences  sir  best wife 
s consolation  maybe ll smooth turning time play
alyx absolutely amazing  d quick dismiss boneworks  alyx outpaces almost fronts  edges experience boneworks actually better solutions 
nt buy boneworks felt hype much fair boneworks tiny indie dev alyx state art  probably buy game m vr titles backlog  reminds arizona sunshine launched far point comparison brutal  magnitudes greater re7 compared vr game time  see difference big studio puts full 100 percent effort concerns needing sell units 
bruh  quarantine tho
think make enjoy
hope valve ignores brats  squeaky wheels  vocal minority  s literally pages pages  practically thing discussed
really easy customize controller bindings steamvr menu  give try
s button ingame menu settings toggles left right hand
option settings  s broken moment  m sure patched soon enough

d reckon alyx  nt take risks  two handed stocked weapons discrepancy controller gun smaller  reverse kinematics  jumping  smooth turn 100  physics based  melee clearly made teleport  valve obviously apprehensive adding controversial features wanted present game anyone pick say  hey nt take much getting used feels right   show game pretty much anyone  ll like  unless nt like horror elements case wo nt  blew ny socks pure polish  s great 
s different options locomotion  top head s teleport style  s  dash  style doom used  s walk re facing mode  s also settings mode s thumbstick left right snap turning  ll look tomorrow though get back let know full range options

got bad news  re bout hour away sections feel like ravencroft ravenholm  gets damn scary times
minor spoiler    wait till meet jeff  
software dev  working home 
ditto  stupid video went viral valve making  wrong game 
yeah  swap left thumb stick right one steam vr menu  
yeah  toggles left right hand shooting hand  forces movement hand  needs movement hand toggle  people like move  shoot hand 
ah cool  makes sense  cheers
covered less  options could want depending level vr legs preferences 
also use dash right stick smooth locomotion selected  genius combination imo 
card runs cool stable normally  quite certain s driver issue  propably made worse fact many people bought radeon vii nt priority  also  much love amds hardware  drivers nt stellar 
surprised well handled sections  m usually chicken vr  love halflife let push  towards end section nt even afraid  even though checked every corner obsessively 
thought meant ravenholm googling  actually mean old marvel comics 
 m glad still income  time d really take free time 
would like editing thumbstick s function rather swapping  also almost always communityuploaded bindings use someone else issue already found fix edit  controllers  edit bindings
ah  sorry misunderstood  yeah implement  maybe future update  sorry  
 deleted 
yeah similar experience adjusting well realized poison head craps reeeeee 
youre right meant ravenholm  whiiilllle since played area
exactly feelings

day one index developed exactly fault year  fault finding steps already website already  replied within 12 hours sent new speaker without quibble despite warranty  took week arrive  best support ve ever dealt

new index owner  wtf audio mirror delay 
prior vr experience playstation vr  using  people watch play beat saber tv also hear audio properly sync video  set audio mirroring steamvr attempted replicate new index steamvr  audio going tv woefully delayed point makes spectator mode absolutely useless    x200b  way fix  really revert laggy  imprecise psvr beat saber parties 
s likely tv avr s fault  nt played tv s remotely low latency audio  bring set speakers showing vr friends since s pretty well synced without processing 
able mostly solve audio delay issue using 18 analog audio instead hdmi  analog receiver  almost mirror delay  hdmi receiver tv  200ms delay  go route  nt forget disable gpu hdmi audio device windows sound settings 
sure re using latest version  fixed audio delay  s like fraction old delay hardly noticeable 
windows issue hardware mirroring apparently  way get around beat saber parties make tv primary audio  windows set hmd speaker volume 0  play vr speakers 
op  ve never problem 
s lg e9 oled low latency gaming mode activated 
lol would redo every time switch wanting spectator vr mode actually using surround audio nonvr game  would run additional analog audio cable way receiver pretty long trip  s peak pc gaming jank  nt know 
firmware index devices date 
low latency gaming mode nothing audio
trying help  s problem vr pc miniitx ncase m1 lives right next receiver living room  could try using optical digital outputs retain surround  nt try m sure works  issue nt index even steamvr  s failure windows tried sorts solutions coming one  instance  use voicemeeter artificially sync audio delay  actually induce delay headset  obviously ideal especially games like beat saber

thankfully ’ deal assholes trying pull something like
’ kinda sucks  good know guess
right  pimax kind get 300 much  quest nt get  must cheaper alternative  300 costs almost much quest 
pimax s much superior version demoed new models last months  thing went least comfortable headset comfortable headset 
s foam counterweight back head quest  meant cheaper replacement 
advice get audio strap  100 enjoy vive another year  das improves comfort immensely imo 
das make better  comfortable experience  og vive nt quite obsolete  especially hardly ever use  bought used vive pro 1 month ago decided sell nt worth minor upgrades  ve also tried index  still think s worth spending money upgrade  controllers maybe  headset   think og vive still viable unit see actual nextgen vr hardware  fwiw  think pro headset best  worth money missing pocket 
considering amount hours put vr already  nt upgrade index pro  das well worth   50 terms bang buck  face used get really hot sore long sessions  1 hour call long  single session   das  could definitely go longer  vive discontinued s still decent headset modern day vr  despite age 
buy bro really better regret buying late
16 hours two years   possible 
get index controllers  re game changers  trust 
us quest much comfort  rift already halo  senns great  also really like koss ksc75  great value
s sellers choice  ebay buyers paradise days  sellers beware 
m confused seems like something completely different das
 deleted 
 og vive nt quite obsolete  especially hardly ever use  s exactly feeling  wanted buy index  feedback technical issues bad  thinking considering much use  knuckles enough 
quest  found counter weight took care comfort issues  actually really hated rift halo strap first  really needed headphones holding comfy 
costs lot less  point people paying 300 das
also  gearvr lens mod  really squeezes much life value og vives  s insane much better picture quality  whoever downvoting probably installed lenses backwards  nt upgrade config file  read early reports people installed wrong  lol  gearvr obvious upgrade anybody correctly  even half assed 
hopefully receive orders  🤞
tried counterweight ’ clunky flopping around ’ really solve facial pressure  cv1 rift comfy  ’ spoiled  excited check das 
one headphones cushion mistaken 
heard something distortion 
gear vr  way would  reading text problem  tend move eyes 
 deleted 
hear splendid das  enjoy  able cinch tight counter weight installed
used two rubber bands tie 6oz power bank back quest  nt flop around  stays put  tied horizontally  maybe helps   bonus  extra battery life 
oh sure  ve heard headphones okay price would high 
add code file vive recalibrate new lenses  backup original update lighthouses using command prompt  s actually really easy  majority people nt happy likely skipped step thought replace lenses  code gotten better better  ve done two vives confirm code makes difference   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments86uwsfgearvrtovivelensadaptersdwdigxa   https  wwwredditcomrvivecomments86uwsfgearvrtovivelensadaptersdwdigxa  m using version 4 
offence  idea re missing  s text  fresnel lenses produce ugly image weak sweet spot overall  re scared breaking vive s one thing  s simple reversible  reward far weighs risk 
guess people think vive store glitched  https  wwwredditcomrvivecommentsepdaigcommentfeit7ic  context1 also initiated chat vive support said received confirmation das actually stock 
tried power bank use switch  probably could made tied  ideally strap nice  using power bank counterweight one thing  asking others little weird 
ive read quite bit better okay
literally swap recalibration anything  works looks way better
nt like pupil swim
telling gear vr already know looks  know gear vr painfull eyes compared htc vive  looks clearer  maybe lack ipd adjustement  beside reading text makes tend look edges  issue vive lenses 
 deleted 
agree  even without recalibration s still huge improvement  try version 4 recalibration file  make sure make backup first incase nt like  nt take long 
nt experienced pupil swim 
know phone looks gearvr lenses  nt know vive looks gearvr lenses  re satisfied s fine  nt know vive gearvr lenses looks like 
yeah  shipping tracking number real confirmation
improve  m inclined touch things nt broken  lot looking around nt notice anything looking wrong  nausea  nothing like  lines straight  think barrel distortion  slightly smaller fov  s expected

without doubt s worth  like wireless adapter
standard vive das  think absolutely worth plan continue using og vive  especially larger head like  standard strap never quite fit  headset tended slip forward 10 minutes  das fits much better  s still bit frontheavy due weight headset  das actually makes possible keep decent period time  installing nt difficult  although require manual dexterity  need snap connections standard strap top sides headset  disconnect audio jack order connect das s audio cable 
yes  much yes 
ve og vive two years got deluxe audio strap two weeks ago feel like severely missed  difference comfort incredible  putting taking also much easier 
recently got mine  guess two months ago  ’ think ’ great  first week headaches session  feel like ’ wear tight original strap  original strap divides pressure forehead cheekbones  das puts forehead  big nose better  headphones convenient ’ rest ears nicely  maybe weird head  always highest point kinda get blocked sides  used high pitched squeak move around lot beat saber thrill fight  metal left side rubbing  seems gone away use  ’ perfect host vr parties  regret covid  ’ time soon  ’ think ’ worth price  overall ’ better strap 
yes  never looked back  used bose qc25 better believe das speakers s much handier das 
compatible standard htc vive    yes  original vive   hard swap strap equip das     easytofollow instructions  cordthreading  s really easy    comfortable    yes   would never go back old one  straps onto whole head back head helps support weight hmd  means less neckaches    headphones    good  amazing   enough  like added convenience always available snap need talk someone room  also adjustable   forward  back sit correctly anyone s face    issues    issues far    use leather face cushion  going cause issues    nt issues  nt different cushion  das nt come anywhere around face cushion sits  nt interfere

100 
 deluxe audio strap worth  yes  replace  yes  get default strap fork £100 get das  das afford  imo s bit overpriced still way worth   compatible standard htc vive  yes  designed og vive   hard swap strap equip das   comfortable  yes  headphones  good  although re going win awards  people prefer cut use  ca nt remove without cutting   personally would nt devalues made pain arse find pair decent price someone nt done   issues  problem ve personally started hurting long period time sooner original strap  could due poor adjustment part  nt recall people problem  ve chance use mine much say sure regular thing case   use leather face cushion  going cause issues  although nt gotten around getting one yet ca nt say definite  nt  s nothing das s design would impacted face cushion 
experience  yes  ve replaced parts upgrading deluxe audio strap really gave old vive lease life  s quality life improvement keep playing upgrade next hmd purchase 
also would like know wireless adaptor  ve looked website mentions compatibility vive pro  cosmos variations headset says nothing standard vive  mean incompatible work every vive headset 
wireless adapter game changer
alright  great know ll use information consideration  found default strap never really sat properly times actually hurt top head  however could since m using standalone hdmi cable instead one kn 3in1 due dying ve therefore used zip ties tie cables together  regardless  info really useful  thank 
already ordered fact set  regardless still good know 
really useful information  thank  think m borderline sold das haha
ve one years ve used og vive m using vive pro  would nt want play standing game without
wireless adapter designed og vive  believe pro need get adapter  also third party adapter lot cheaper understand supposed better battery life  also understand official one provides better experience lower latency something  nt looked 
trust try want burn original strap dumpster fire
actually appear  stock   https  wwwvivecomukaccessoryvivedeluxeaudiostrap  official site rare sight 
yeah  curious shipping costs replace 3in1 cable almost spent £25 shipping costs alone found cheaper alternative
ouch  yeah looked want charge £1440 shipping  bringing total £12439  understand better ones ebay tend expensive  ended buying brand new    https  wwwonbuycomgbhtcvivedeluxeaudiostrapc3188p4771143  around rrp price free shipping  dubious never heard site  could tell s bit like amazon marketplacetype site prices varied  could saved around fiver nt slow   s stock right stock notification option case wanted enable hope best  otherwise might get lucky ebay find another site selling better price like 
caved bought  post really helped many amount comments saying worth helped  hopefully ll next shift work haha 
haha fair enough  keeping fingers crossed  also said s worth taking return policy account  idea htc s like  know rep poor customer service  fingers crossed ll happy wo nt ever think 
things read  dont think ll want return time soon 
hopefully  nt personally seen anyone say ve problems  least re rare occurrences  
hope ll okay however recently got 16gb ram stated 3200mhz actually 2133mhz knows  honesty faith itll okay
ok typically comes ram speeds s usual lower advertised sake compatibility  essentially need manually oveclock get advertised speed  usually advertised speed s tested stable overclock  depending motherboard ram module might even preset profiles save hassle mess around voltages clock speeds etc  tl  dr  ram speeds typically set lower box ensure s likely run box  need adjust advertised speed  edit  s also possibility motherboard supports lower speed  s case  might  bios update could help  otherwise d matter upgrading mobo  edit 2  also make sure ram correct configurationslots  depending many sticks  slots might issue  could potentially another solution re quite right order 
update  arrived  ve already installed das  easier expected   controllers charging cant wait try  little awkward set since use separate hdmi cable outside 3in1 cable nt look like itll cause much issue 
nice  glad hear s arrived soon  luck ram 
really  upgraded motherboard switched amd processor  ryzen 5 3600 matters  got asrock x570m pro4 believe supposed support high ram speeds  ve also gone bios profile believe suitable ram
could try different profiles  see s one aimed higher speed s stable 🙂
perhaps  s little annoying every time try change something pc attempts boot  fails  3 times successfully fourth time
yeah nt sound right overly stable 
yeah  s right m leaving  ve jumped conclusion ram issue honestly idea
hey  trying strap enjoyed apart one issue  block part 3in1 cable splits 3 individual cables seems pressing head making quite uncomfortable  way get around 
 mine   https  imgurcomaanrnk7w  helps  sure setup differently 
first glance looks like individual cables longer mine  ve tightened headset quite bit seems allow tuck cables top headset similarly looks image showed however due tight seems slightly uncomfortable little tight head  could mainly part issue two cables  3in1 hdmi cable  running headset instead one  3 1  also means keep top panel open 
m surprised cables different lengths unless s different model numbers slight variances  third party one used  idea exist mine came box   come need hdmi running well 
use standard 3 1 cable need different hdmi cable due 3 1 hdcp error something  basically hdmi cable wont send display something  found alternative running 5 metre hdmi cable along 3 1 replacement  works however zip tie cables together rare occasion blacks much cheaper alternative simply replacing 3 1 cable  however time didnt job outside college could barely afford 
lol damn  struggling much would nt thought buying vr headset time would best idea  able share photo fixcabling looks like  overview shot like mine might easiest 
would knew  keep mind issue occurred months ago 
take photograph phone upload http  imgurcom
http  imgurcomapznapma  think  right 
good 🙂 also looks fine  m sure cause  could maybe try loosening 3in1 cable slightly pull away head would  like   https  imgurcomab5q03be   although m sure well d stay like especially wearing  could maybe put bit tape around clip prevent sliding back happens   alternatively could maybe try wrapping something soft around cable like bit cloth  like   https  imgurcomav5hlyjs   although m sure could better job  quick fix give idea    could maybe cut old shirt size nt anything use  course d likely need tape 
could try pulling away  means d hdmi cable may cause issues knows  cloth could work knows  either way  ll give go  thanks 
never know til try  neither ideas let know try coming something else  also instead cloth could always try something else soft like foam  whatever else might able find around house  either way good luck 
appreciate  m hoping itll simple moving cable forward slightly 
update headset  broke  part attach strap left side fallen apart completely therefore cant hold place  m boxing nt see use anymore  nevermind  way ask help however ve taped back hopes hold
sure  clip mine occasionally comes loose clip back  seen bought directly still warranty 
strap seems fine  s connects actual headset broke 
mean  like   https  imgurcomaevwoevo   clips back  like   https  imgurcomadtzymik 
 mean parts inside clip actually fallen  probably would helped said earlier 
s ok  s easy describe things  s pictures help haha  s definitely broken could return ask replacement  pointing broken arrival 
like said  s strap s broken  s headset  unfortunately cant get replacement since ve already path trying get one 3 1 besides  tape seems holding  worst case scenario  save weeks buy index headset standalone  ve already got index controllers two vive base stations 
yeah  s thought might referring clip photo rather strap  damn  sucks  tape nt work something could try using glue instead 
sure  maybe  s little concerning though metal part exposed dont want put glue could important 
yeah maybe good idea lol  definitely nt sound like things going way m sorry hear  maybe index would nt bad call  although personally would nt want spend much  might course able subside cost partially broken vive  m still trying get hands knuckles 
yeah  perhaps could sell vive headset work  needs diy  get index  would nt das waste money 
yeah  nt believe use das index  especially comes solution  das still seem retain value ebay decided sell would nt lose much regard least  completely course bad much nuisance 
yeah  upgrade index ll likely sell vive das  probably together due old strap breaking  perhaps separately vive slightly cheaper others due strap  dunno  ll figure 
well good luck  hope works either way 🙂
thanks  appreciate
hey  going back ram  sorry keep bothering  seem like know talking   went msi afterburner turn fan speeds noticed memory clock speed  think could causing issue overclocking memory bios 
s cool  always happy help 🙂 question m honestly sure ’ msi motherboard long time  s probably appropriate subreddit ask  would nt know suggest  outside reddit  linus tech tips forum   https  linustechtipscommainforum5cpusmotherboardsandmemory  might good place ask

value og vive  deluxe audio  wireless kit 
og vive goodies  nt know keep since nt play much anymore  m looking ebay nt see many sold listings  might play  figured s people still interested wireless vr maybe s better move 
’ setup ’ bear part  think vr starting hit stride fairly developed games point  know mean seems get bit old  comes goes  really depends whether find particular game experience sink several hours  games little shallow real gems  said  due pandemic fact ’ whole lot wireless headsets mass production outside quest 2 currently  could probably get premium ’ willing patient 
get knuckles ll pretty much diet index  wireless  worthy compromise opinion 
wireless adapter og vive alone going  300 ebay used  yes would say people still value setup 
yup yes well
second adding index knuckles  setup instead wands could nt happier 
looking purchase vive rarely see people bundling things together  sometimes  went ton money  obvious reasons   nt know d get selling separately  either way ca nt imagine d trouble selling  unless things drastically changed since index came   d rather keep definitely worth keeping 3 
reallyweirdperson posted saying looking wireless kit
probably one niche groups  replies s also contains pretty much long running fans  ve set since first available ca nt bear part  anything wired seems archaic  nt huge jumps vive really entice  ve permanently mounted lighthouses living room corners  ugly stands  one even notices  thing ve upgraded index controllers  definitely worth  m guessing next generation ll finally start thinking upgrading headset  ll either mind blowing wired support wireless 
interesting thought  yeah nt play ton  got  still believe  without wireless vr nt fun  worse graphics
s strange og vive set  og vive  das  wireless adapter  cost  800 year ago worth  1k
m using pretty whole kit  including vr cover  without wireless adapter  instead pulley system  man  s pretty nice controllers vaguely shaped like sex toys  analog sticks face buttons nice

vive  deluxe audio strap  long hair  disaster  looking ideas
hiya  long time user  2016   mainly play index  wife regularly playing vivedas  however  long hair always problem  leaves loose  das looses grip  rides   normal ponytail  ca nt  move enough   s resting s supposed  occipital area   onlybest option far use simple hair band  push hair back hole das  buit complicated tiring put remove headset     better way       long haired players  ideas 
low pony tail  pull tighten  hair tie tight enough shorter hair help keep longer hair top loosening causing das slide  bald  worked plenty customers long hair 
friend edward could sort problem
pigtails  wear high   like   https  livestaticflickrcom318527783264290dcd647861jpg  braids optional 
anton h3vr might advice  ll track discord 
tried tying hair bunny earpig tail style go wide open top sides strap 
try headband  fiancée wear buff prevent sweat fogging displays  also help push hair provide extra grip
nt feed whole ponytail opening back  position knot  s comfortable way experience  nt overly burdensome loosen strap good put back first right position  ponytail knob sticking  tighten mask face  backwards normal order needs bit looser 
wear hat 
maybe hair net  hood balaclava 
disclaimer  nt deluxe strap long hair  short hair vanilla strap  nt like hair product smudges lenses  rest hmd head   collection buffs wear specifically vr gaming  might help  dunno 
try counter weight 
nt das may missing problem  looked picture   long hair use vive either use standard ponytail holder feed hair straight back  set inside shirt  back   keep way  might explained well  instead putting ponytail holder way skull  put much lower   hair flows bottom usual  gets tied together shortly 
play quest might help find easy position hari fits comfortable
hair cut question 
setup vive  deluxe audio strap  long hair  low pony tail way play 
tried results slightly better normal ponytail  try guess
yes  barbers still closed 
depends live  open texas along restaurants  parks  etc

exact vive setup deluxe audio strap wireless adapter  debating whether pick index controllers  working  ’ hesitant upgrade hmd  well  og vive still holds really well 
thinking getting used vive pro  interesting prices  doubt comfort compared vive das 
yes  og vive  pro  index  quest  stuck vive pro  actually used og recently  reminded big improvement pro  ordered g2  replace pro sim rig  still keep wireless pro room scale  nt wear glasses  really consider gearvr lens mod  cheap  easy  much better clarity huge reduction glare  video mod   https  youtubew6bdaovpzpc   https  youtubew6bdaovpzpc

vive pro  index controllers wireless adapter best combo
upgraded og vive pro  also bought index get released  would say index still great money wise option upgrade origin vive  improved resolution microphone easily compensate shortness  bad black level  wireless option  weight   however m disappointed switched pro index  m going upgrade origin vive headset  would go vive pro  safe option  better resolution wireless support  try something risky  pimaxhp g2 
nt find index controllers replace wands pavlov  nt like joystick think touchpad suited vr  also finger interactions gimmick  get anyway  probably boneworks really requires index controllers  wands hurts hands game  grip button

yes  prefer das headstrap  https  wwwthingiversecomthing3890440
biggest bonus  personally  re actually holding  object instead squeezing controller wait like  700 
think lacks force feedback button simulation  nt realise dropping objects  sometime nt realize craving objects  drop grab accidentally index controllers

cat ate audio cable  share misery 
finally happened  cat chewed audio cable vive s das   pardon shitty photo    https  imgurcomazdk3zya  ca nt hear dick vr  anyone luck soldering things back together  crappy soldering iron somewhere  though m worried audio quality suffering  since cable carries channels  cat tax   s lucky s cute    https  imgurcomags28hju 
get good solder audio quality pretty much perfect 
shittiest part photo break  ca nt see exactly broken  audio cable like  probably 3 individual wires cable  audio completely gone one side  take another picture showing break 
good thing nt video cable  d soldering  seems like would satisfying chomp  d worried 
use soldering iron cat get dog 
managed solder two normal 35mm cables together make worlds ugliest aux cable  tape replacement shrinkwrap  works without audio problems day  dont know winding cables though may put extra tension soldering joint  sure fixate properly done  last resort  could always  remove headphones   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vilqaj0qqgi   may make repair easier  use normal ones 
 shots    https  imgurcomarzmgw7d  trying manhandle cable little possible  audio completely gone  m assuming wires broken  although figure ll sever completely solder anyway 
inline splcing cable small pain ass  would recommend cutting cable using sort 3pin connector wire ends solder audio cables join ends  3pin computer fan extensions would perfect task  alternatively  could try opening das see cables connect  mostly likely sort plug match replace entire cable length  remember put shrink wrap first 
would connector simplify things  wires ends  nt mean m double splicing 
would say crimp terminals wires insert housing create connector  male one side  female  plug  crimping terminals small tricky  seems expensive  thing magic  https  wwwamazoncomgpawdb002avvo7k connector kit  maybe like  https  wwwamazoncomdpb078rrprqz uses housing male female side  male pins stick end  butt together connect  positive lock  preferably put heat shrink dab shoe goo hot glue something keep together 
wire wire splicing tricky best imho  tiny wires inside coiled audio cable  s going worse  yes would double splicing  wo nt worry cable length wires trying pull time selves apart 
s good point  ve got 3pin jsts coming  goes hell ll probably try crimping approach umeatandbourbon suggested    goes hell  flimsy excuse scoop index  p
good luck  may soldering gods smile
headset audio keeps cutting
hardware  helps  htc vive cosmos elite rtx 2080 ryzen 7 2700x 32gb ram problem started couple weeks ago  one day s working fine  update nvidia drivers night  next day audio decides hates  common issue point audio perpetually cutting  one second hear  next m deaf  rinse repeat insanity  occasionally also audio drop quality well point hearing static audio  ve tried reinstalling nvidia drivers many times  clean installs well  nothing helped  ve even returned headset  within return window  gotten replacement sent  replacement arrived today  still problems  anybody clue s going fix 
ve bluetooth enabled pc bluetooth devices 
tried switching audio output nvidia high definition vive cosmos multimedia audio vice versa  heard usb cause issues audio necessarily gpu drivers 
maybe connection problem aj hole  35mm aj headset plug directly hmd  able find taking face cushion holder 
pc nt even bluetooth  despite attempts install 
tried  either get usb cutting  displayport giving static slowly increases quit  static occasion even affects speakers switching headset  though either problems try run game anything else steamvr  youtube playing headset nt cause problems 
tried got replacement  issues  somehow nt think anything s different time  guess d say s probably sorta problem steamvr  could nt tell could find 
tried downgrading drivers previous version  sorted problem asus r9 290  new drivers made pc freeze whenever opened web browser 
see  last thing d install older nv driver  seems started updated nv driver  anyway  please keep us posted findings  may help one day  p
tried  still issues  either audio keeps cutting steadily increases static hear 
tried old drivers  still problems  m sure could  point ve resigned getting 30ft aux cord plug directly headphones  zip tie hmd cable something 
wonder drivers update bios graphics card s causing issue  man m lost  let know solve
ahh  works sucks 
use vives builtin ports audio input 
nt know much ports  use headphone jack audio input use splitter also use audio   im assuming   use extra usb port audio input  modmic 50  
pretty sure audio jack output  yes  able use extra usb port 
vive mic  lot people nt realize play fps locks open get killed others hear breathing around corner 
personally use modmic wireless  games ve played works well  though nt know violently d shake head fly away 
 like adapter  also  recommend one 
yeah vive mic pop filter ends sounding really bad  hear someone breathing like said
nt tried one  imagine could use something like  https  wwwamazoncomugreenexternalheadphonemicrophonedesktopsdpb01n905voy
keep mind using usb port usually disable camera
ve heard people taping bit cloth vive mic rudimentary pop filter  sure would work purposes 
could purchase  one   https  wwwamazoncomantlionaudioattachablenoisecancellingplaystationdpb07yn26pbtrefpdlpo23t113259200097921910  encodingutf8  pdrdib07yn26pbt  pdrdre4bd715dc7c5475bb8e302b1cffdbb4c  pdrdweugxe  pdrdwgx02up  pfrdp7b36d496f366463194d361b87b52511b  pfrdr5eq0729552z86qfadqaa  psc1  refrid5eq0729552z86qfadqaa  instead 
mean  wanted use usb left nt used anything else
ve tried nt fix problem entirely s want external mic instead
would think work  ca nt guarantee  kept talking headphone jack audio adapters  working assumption minijack mic 
think amount bandwidth available usb  decent usb controller vive one things plugged  may fine  lot usb traffic  camera may work 
nah wondering needed buy

deluxe audio strap nt loud enough  made amplifier 
image   https  imgurcomat8ilxxo   https  imgurcomat8ilxxo  anyone interested making  ll fix mistakes pcb post instructions later  sound quality comparable original  extra volume make huge difference comes immersion  really makes action heavy set pieces hl  alyx even terrifying 
find less 50  loud enough  set higher get painfully loud  might hearing issuesdamage get worse loud sounds
pretty cool work  m wondering though ve tried solution  vive seems two audio playback devices choose windows  m sure  one waay louder  like  physically painful   tried see s difference  windows playback devices window  two devices related sound vive headset   speakers  usb audio device   htcvive  nvidia high definition audio  s also  gain reduction vive hdmi audio  option steamvr settings  might help boost sound disabled 
usual audio level 25   turn games   damn 
nice  honestly usually set volume pretty low nt issues looks cool 
also find stock volume usually loud 100  usually turn  ca nt imagine listening louder  cool project though  m picturing adding huge subs make peoples hair stand blow windows  like auto stereo competitions 
hearing test last year  luckily m fine   joking previous comment  pc headset loud enough  problem could unit  al least solution 
thanks heads  tried options  hdmi output seems louder  still enough  ll check gain reduction option tomorrow  somehow nt found  thanks 
thanks  guess problem either hardware ears   could preference thing 
s definitely hardware ears  every das ve used gets painfully loud near max   ve used 12   hearing tested last couple years 
luckily hearing fine  tested last year   joking last comment  thanks warning

use small usb sound card
modmic wireless entirely wireless solution  m familiar vive mute button built easy muting  sure vive easy mute button 
would require run wire computer vive wireless adapter would nt work

theres spare usb port headset  thats option  modmic wireless version
yup  might need small usb extension  honestly bought soundblaster play 3 lot really cheap soundcards lot interference used twist ties attach top strap vive 
vive mic pop filter get really bad quality using s want mod mic
vive  wireless  screen goes black still sound 
nt played vive didnt problem  random time gameplay  could nt make beatsaber level   vive headset screen goes black  sound continues playing see gameplay still going monitor nothing vive headset screen  first thought adapter extension cable got could put tower closet keep room cooler  removed adapter cards installed wireless pci card directly motherboard  nt really change anything  non pro vive htc wireless kit ryzen 3900x  1070ti  might video driver update last month  ca nt remember  ideas 
try unplugging ends short 3 1 cable wireless hmd replug securely
make sure controllers  never turn 
 deleted 
would bet nt controller bug s heat issue usb cableport issue  check wireless adapter logs heat around timestamp blacks  make sure controllers set never turn try different battery try different usb cable
exact issue happen turned overheating issue wireless adapter  zip tied small fan top wireless adapter issue since 
ll give try
got level gorn beat sabers shutoff  hopefully fixed 
ll check setting 
gave try  still thing 
wtf
reseated cable goes wireless adapter hmd  seems working better  ll keep playing see fixed 
interesting  felt top wireless adapter nt feel overly hot  also playing ceiling fan  maybe ll look adding fan  power fan  battery pack  extra usb hmd
excellent news  hope keeps working  
also added 40 mm fan top mine  played last night around six hours  problems  might getting hot
re using little 35mm fan power extra usb slot wireless adapter  see noticeable decrease battery life powering fan way  adapter also nt feel super hot touch  temperature logs showed reaching pretty toasty temperatures would stop working  re questioning whether temperature issue  logs great place start  last time checked located c  programdatavive wirelessconnectionutilitylog
nt even think getting hot shutting  would think would shut audio well  hmd definitely still power  goes black  definitely pitch black hmd powered

unfortunately replacement cables nt available  real shame would fairly easy replace could get one  best bet probably see much sony would charge warranty repair  diy cable repair would difficult  impossible  ve seen video mate vince successfully completed cable repair  shows pinout diagram made would helpful  re feeling brave  https  youtubefcl07rapkse
rabbit chew mine tried asking around  everyone says s nothing  ve hard time finding replacement  s psvr2  might buy bundle sell camera controllers soften blow  s bummer 
 ’ tried using electrical tape act cast still going black  need use small  stiff stick  like chopstick  use splint addition tape 
terrible stress point v1  sony fixed v2 model  seems lot breaking age  try sony webchat  think thing open  get fully refurbished one  look brand new   100us or whatever country  ll cheaper buying new one get new one  ll get better v2 model least 
s lot easier said done  data  cables  conductors tiny fair amount unless extremely experienced knife comes stripping cables chances stripping cutting low  let alone multiples  best thing would find data technician  someone works ethernet cables something similar s used dealing gauge wire

usual usb cat5e cable  usb 10 lanes cat5ecat6 cable house 12 lanes  hdmi houses 10 lanes well  larger usb lanes require higher bandwidth  posters suggestion easy  wired pass cat5e connection  s hard  everything color coded  honesty gauge isnt anything really bat eye  hdmi wires larger cat5e fewer lanes require bandwidth  also great thing  goes one direction colors unique vs cat5e similar colors  ex strip red white  red  white cables  
old version ran problem times  works  d move d lose video sound  wound hanging cord ceiling rather pulled  seemed like weight pulling cord causing issue  works pretty well  might help find replacement

people ca nt strip 12 gauge wire knife  really think anyone nt already know option able strip conductors without damaging knife  like go ahead try s fucked anyways loss  amount shit repair others trying shit exactly like without really knowing quite high  edit  location damage conductor weak spot likely break short amount time anyways due stresses cable location  get start process

mostly really wonky patch

got platinum headset sale days play  one major selling points well 3d audio  anyone speak well works vr titles  vr heavily m hoping works excellent 
""
gold headset directional sound works quite well vr would assume platinum good better
headset earphones gets 3d audio psvr  game  platinum headset 3d audio small amount standard ps4 games  download headset companion app see list supported games 
anyone know difference two  gold platinum  something really big  would much jump g p 
thing actually fit well headset  interference 
thats change equalizer presets setup think optimal games
golds break lot easier
right  shows list 3d audio supported games 
plus much better battery life platinums 
could elaborate  planning getting gold headset 
made cheap plastic break  quick google review show mean  spend extra little bit get platinums

headset wired get 3d sound  built breakout box  personally found brookhaven experiment great good headphones though  dark space trying watch enemies 360 around really start notice good audio works  wasnt  enemies left  like  theres enemy 30 yards 8 clock  realistic 
one needs special headset 3d audio  headsets psvr 
’ bit rick morty game answer phone  3d audio super effective literally move source sound effect 
mean non vr games  power vr headset without putting head  use 3d  71  audio headphones like platinum headset  works fine uncharted 4 example  need go settings audio select 3d headset 
nt tried psvr yet  headphones 3d audio amazing  pretty much headphones  personally gold headset really adds experience  game first person  play without headset adds much  online shooters also lot fun lot games hear footsteps players behind re trying sneak  ve called cheater lot times  base much play style sound imagine playing psvr add even  one sidenote  s personal preference  games third person feel headset  time location sound based camera angle feels bit weird 
wow sounds amazing  try free games tomorrow 
nt even wired  gold headset wireless also offers 3d audio 
hi  also work last us part 2  red dead 2 ghost tsushima  get 3d audio plug steel series headset psvr processor unit via 35mm cable plug 
gold s processing makes audio surround  want true binaural audio designed psvr plug though  works wirelessly difference nt noticeable though  save wire keep using way  wires problems haha
game supports yes  otherwise 71 sound  uncharted 4 example  turning psvr  without putting helmet  manually select 3d headphones  rdr select 71  since support 3d sound
ah ok understood  games ’ 3d surround  still get alternative headphone connected psvr  eg 71 rdr 2 mentioned 
yes  probably need select manually  game settings  normally nt change automatically 
ok noted  another thing want check  turn psvr  v2   tv resolution automatically drops 1080p  check video output setting ps4 says “ using vr headset setting limited 1920x1080 ”   way enable 4k hdr playing tv psvr 
nt 4k tv  probably ca nt get  psvr 1080 4k  v2   hdr work  m sure

got og vive first came  never really much vr  d play beatsaber every months  maybe try new game couple times year  mostly sat collecting dust  finally opportunity set roomscale s crazy much better makes experience  m even talking ability walk around  barely  mostly couple steps left right  one step forward backward   real game changer chaperone  d tried set  never worked  hindsight  d set standing  nervous putting boundaries close desk  bookshelf  physical space limitations  make close possible even make minimum size   chaperone makes everything much nicer  two big gains  1 knowing boundaries means know m safe position really let go  especially since chaperone gradually fade hand body approaches boundaries  2 playing standing mode  d almost always lose track position space  much xy position  nt enough room issue  keeping track rotation frequently issue  constantly juggle cord  etc  every time chaperone pops  immediately reorient center available space  today played vanishing realms almost 2 hours without even thinking  ve never spent long vr single game  hell  vr game ve even spent long total beat saber  currently 3 hours played past however many years  put perspective  ve got 83 vrcapable games steam library  though s including things like tabletop simulator slime rancher nt necessarily vr games  anyways  m sure old news  wanted bring case s someone else  like  nt realize much better roomscale actually  really gamechanger 
wait  slime rancher supports vr 
ve always shaken  virtual  cane people roomscale system  prefer use stickturn standing mode  congrats stepping light 
get nice comfy rug feel boundary s easier legs makes comfortable enjoyable experience  use ikea rug   https  wwwikeacomgbensearchproducts  qvindum   https  wwwikeacomgbensearchproducts  qvindum  roomscale vr best  s freeing get rid cable  still vive type hmd use wireless addon 
ve loved roomscale since beginning reason giant green room vr   
m worried pulling wires end hurting back standing still
personally turn chaperone time spacial awareness space  helps tv corner playspace nt square one corner chopped
consider using stop sign vr valuable equipment close  games immersive ignore boundaries 
unfortunately fully  s yetanother 15min experience  free dlc   https  storesteampoweredcomapp939480slimeranchervrplayground     vr playground unique slime rancher experience created especially vr    include entirety original game   
yes  s really toy  s actual game  couple environments interact slimes really gameplay 
ye
wait re supposed turn spot room scale
nt really even option couple weeks ago  never occurred couple days ago rerun room setup roomscale 
know expensive love wireless adapter  climbing virtual spiral staircase regular cable immersion breaking
use overhead cable management  re great
aww thats shame  d love play full full game vr 
question statement  either way   absolutely 
 would turn around real life  vr option use controller well
yup  wireless adapter vive pro playtime increased dramatically  index s far better hmd use way less cable   really really hope valve working wireless addon 
go wireless  ca nt go back
friends play vr surf web seperate audio 
want someone play steam vr game audio sent earphones also using computer watching youtube  browsing web  etc  pc robust enough handle multitasking ca nt figure split audio described  whenever vive powered audio output switched vive headset  play audio pc interrupts whoever playing game  insights 
 https  wwwhowtogeekcom352787howtosetperappsoundoutputsinwindows10   https  wwwhowtogeekcom352787howtosetperappsoundoutputsinwindows10    x200b  looks doable  set browserspotifywhatever go directly device  steamvr s thing  even audio mirroring  also  hate newfangled  settings   much stuff duplicates old menus hidden 
 every time ve seen topic come  s always something s gotten way  additionally  vr application cursor focus  typically  causes fairly steep performance penalty  doubleadditionally  large numbers apps tend stall  machine  especially re accessing something mechanical hdd  randomly browsing web computer running vr game  matter fast machine  part due shit browsers   fantastic way make vr app run hitch judder time 
mean  legit set audio steamvr headset  desktop audio whatever re using  complicate things use voicemeter something digital assigning per application crap 
save time get separate super cheap pc sub  100 range
go windows store look app called  ear trumpet  trying kind thing came across app  see want 
windows mr  family playing superhot vr overwatch monitor week  overwatch run potato superhot demanding  3700x 16gb ram 1070 tried nt know well running  one complained 
whoever downvoted anton  shame  s dev h3vr  also  use phone tablet 
thanks response  testing based recs see happens  able watch youtube muted someone plays lab nt cause major stuttering player noticed  imagine bigger games may perform worse  rig ryzen 5 3600xrtx 2070 super
s interesting hear  ve never issue pc used also playing vr  s also super easy set audio split vr applications  example  use voicemeeter split lot audio stuff  along virtual audio cable  chrome set windows output virtual line  gets fed voicemeeter  outputs whatever audio device want  set index default device running games voicemeeter induces latency becomes disorienting vr    x200b  games work perfectly fine nt focus  select nt like lose focus  elite dangerous example  part games tend play nt really care  randomly browsing web never hinders performance enough cause visible issues vr    x200b  op  try running voicemeeter  windows set browser default use voicemeeter output  voicemeeter set output whatever device want used pc user  set default audio device hmd nt get latency audio    x200b  hell  fun  jank crap ever  genshin impact crap controller support  run steam s big screen mode get 360 controller working  found  launch big screen  fire genshin impact  get working controller  fire steamvr  fire ovr tool kit  start vrchat  play games vr playing vr game hahaha  actually hinder performance  s cause m literally running 2 games time 
nt work  vive steal output certain amount time
seems like silly recommendation
disagree ’ use browser vr  assuming little hitched fine  someone else completely using one bad time 
disable exclusive control stuff set correctly  cv1  vive  vive pro  quest via vd link  work way  alternative something like voicemeter 
offense question nonsensical  especially developer ’ perspective  ’ weird “ requirement ”  sometimes best solutions simple ones 
well  s really possible split audio per program two people using machine time  losing focus game wreak additional havoc person vr whole issue 
hmm  ll troubleshoot tonight see wrong  thanks response
since headset acting peripheral  would make sense d want isolate inputoutput  s steam vr gives options set  s application gives option determine inputs  particular scenario may less likely others  nt seem good reason s possible  appreciate response nevertheless 
right  issues focus game minimize  s window  like pavlov stops s minimized 
’ thing  many many good technical reasons  vr demanding cpu gpu  maybe one day future want make sense new tech like device mainly uses cloud processing  really cheap tablet  pc  smart phone thing  without performance cost cheap
yeah  games issues  star wars squadrons stops rendering ui focus  stops updating hud 
game mess
 yet still love  man  someone remade campaigns xwing tie fighter engine assets

checkout moss dope seated vr experience  also checkout viveport sub service like gamepass vr  pretty great value  ultimately s lot games play seated

games experiences fine used seated helps  also btw  controllers connect pc using bluetooth need wireless dongle wireless capable motherboard connect set doesnt bluetooth built headset  also  best luck venturing do😁
s really great entrylevel vr headset   use seated  preferably motion controllers   gaming controllers work games well  like xbox one controllers   experiences designed seated gaming  even  still play seatd   steam store page  game supporting vr  show s supported officially seated roomscale vr  need relatively beefy pc  least midtier gaming pc  also  windows 10 required  download mixed reality portal windows store  recommend downloading steam steamvr  officially supports steamvr  buy vr game steam play headset  s base model builtin audio builtin bluetooth  need  bluetooth connect motion controllers  get usb bluetooth stick like 1020    tho 35 jack output headset  connect headset  also  controllers work batteries  get  plan keeping playing  recommend rechargeable battery higher 15v  also  sure room set correctly  s super bright  completely dark  headset work   tracks position based cameras   also  nt like huge glass reflective surfaces   exposed leds  see individual lights  controller tracked lot led light  confuse tracking  means  good enough pc  ability move upper body  highly recommend  s awesome experience  especially never tried proper pcvr 
elite dangerous amazing vr played sitting 
model  it´s definitely great value starting vr  suggest try google earth vr  available free steam  provides great experience seated rather slow paced  reducing risk motion induced nausea 
exact headset also live nz  great gift   least get app called big screen steam use virtual spacecinema  great joining random rooms watching 3d movies random people internet discussing life politics random stuff  give go 
little advice  try use hinge little possible  break easily  d recommend adjust favourite position put like 
dude  totally play mobility issues  use arms easily  use motion controllers  ca nt use keyboardmousejoystick play games like elite star wars squadrons 
based specific disability  would recommend games like  trover saves universe  games support seated position  nt fret though  tons vr games seated vr support  especially sim games  
ll get lot seated expiriences like boneworks  half life alyx  subnautica  starwars squadrens  even standing moving around nt possability s still lots enjoy 
trouble walking  nt actually need walk walk vr  games pretty good variety movement input options  ve got headset hp model  use flight  racing simulators  find seated vr experiences best anyways  waving around motion controllers little gimmicky 
congrats  recommending favorite sit vr experiences  vox machinae  best giant robot fighting game ever  700 hours game  well done game sitting  touch controls game  cockpit  star wars squadrons  played keyboard mousepc controller better yet flight stick  amazing game fleet battles dogfights  best star wars game ever star trek bridge crew  amazing star trek game  play captain different stations  helm  engineering  tactical  battlezone  remake classic video game  vr  cool tron like tank game  tons games work well games great games played alone friends  play games great group guys met playing vr great way socialize pandemic  hit want play sometime

could life changing  play every game sitting using playspace movers let experience moving around socialising unhindered 
flaw though  ca nt adjust distance pupils  s way  head size designers mind using constant annoyance pain  returned mine 
someone trying advocate better accessibility adherence company  vr ar regularly come terrible accessibility  vision  hearing  mobility  cognitive  motion  sensory fail comes vr  maybe direct response question felt worth throwing
lenovo explorer  need connect earphones audio  cheap earphones would work  use audio computer speakers ’ immersive  vr unfortunately uses lot motion  particular  head look around  would need use arms control motion controller  ’ motion normal experience unmatched 
think s one mine  works good  use nvidia 970 based laptop dated  still works good  recommend  expect die  good seated game  like james bond themed puzzle game 
games run well issues  however find game nt moving joystick teleportation s program called walkinvr  help however believe s free

honestly thought nt gon na able run game m pleasantly surprised  m using og hp headset running 4690k 16 gb ram 8gb rx480 medium settings oculus cv1 resolution steam vr settings 60hz mode play problem  
open game menu  press thumbstick opens steam vr settings  screen looks like menu 
shelved odyssey nearly two years  think ’ dust get smooth locomotion smooth turning working properly  smooth locomotion works thumbsticks assume 
want get sure well suited windows mr 
s great game  m difficulty reliably accessing backpack samsung odyssey  anyone else run problem come knack works 
reverb wondering buy steam wmr  nt lot space walk around  played seated 
problem guys need help  ’ see hands main menu ’ select start new game    controller definitely tracked  ’ nothing game 
want  badly  ve got 1060 3gb    m tempted try anyway though  real option budgetwise would maybe used  refurb 1660 super  would run least  really hoping nextgen upgrade  least discount currentgen nextgen arrives  said  nvidia s canceled s product announcements  things stabilize  regarding covid19   meh 
also good people never player hl 
m playing day one   part nt sure would work okay gtx 970 d need bump least 1070  try  far looks plays pretty well autochosen  low  graphics setting  m going fairly slow careful lots scavenging ammo conservation  think s valve intending play since nt seem way run continuous locomotion zombies really stumble around randomly  s weird placed time two previous games  m hopeful ll able upgrade gun hl2  m curious whether eventually loses gravity gloves keeps without needing change anything hl2  since could blend appear regular gloves  one thing little surprised quickly re thrown situations gruesome ravenholm  know  re knee deep corpses unidentifiable bioglop  m glad vr nt yet smellovision places  like ve played point though  dialog nt make cringe  environments artfully done  mechanics seem work part  certainly details question actions might work better headsets  game seems much complete lot s made vr right 
m 4 hours point  nt progressed really far story m trying find every little bit resin m stupid puzzles  one minor complaint far  loading areas  wmr freezes screen seconds makes want barf  although seem pretty well spread nt deal often  game pretty amazing though  ve completed many vr games 100  one 
m really enjoying game far  4 hours  two wmr specific gripes m experiencing  1 holding pistol two hands makes left hand controller loose tracking obscurred  option attachclamp pistol like pavlov 2 longer passages quiet  let arms relax m also loosing tracking hands stuck floor wiggle around issues due 2 camera tracking wmr recent games shown software solutions remedies  1 pavlov lets attach hand gun 2 boneworks physical arms s possible hands far headset  edit  happy report holding gun two hands works intended since patch 11  
m surprised good looks well performs  environments detailed packed full objects yet frame rate rarely dropped 90 absolutely insane ve able accomplish  3 hours m excited play  gotten static audio lot due cable extensions o even though powered usb hub  switch audio speakers back headset seems go away although sometimes left right channels get switched  s game s fault  s frustrating 
played hour last night everything ultra settings hp reverb 2080ti 16gb 9700k beautiful fluid smooth experience  world  wimp though flinch everything looks amazing sooo immersive
want buuuuut got issues cash atm
downloaded last night played around 40 minutes  totally blew mind  however kept getting  low video memory  error startup  nt seem impact game  regardless decided update drivers  game wo nt go past loading screen  m going try starting new game  pretty frustrated right 
ve gotten hour s amazing  works great wmr  thought would issues far good 
tried 18 minutes get smooth turning work  killed went right back skyrim  ll wait valve get shit together  boneworks continue vr better valve  valve already example copy 
better boneworks  prior years better vr title 
got vr seeing trailers  graphics card nt good enough play 😭
weight 
s bugged  turning allow smooth turning  nt  m sure ll patched  physical objects work  ca nt damage  like say pick chair  headcrab collide bounce  rather going item head  also think construction helmets protect headcrab    wish could physically jump normal speed fall  probably add options hearing players  specifically options making jump button press  disabling teleport altogether 
able set smooth turning openvr advanced settings  mapping smooth turn left right dpad joystick  even automatically overrides game setting  s good real support  albeit steps get 
experiencing issues dissapointments luckly graphix make small bumps  ps  hell smooth turning  company billions  easy fast implement 
acceleration causes motion sickness pretty badly  m gon na guess falling speed qol thing 
agreed  playing boneworks  s definitely quality life stuff could done  lack sprint option  well crouch system similar boneworks  would major improvement 
biggest gripe reloading shotgun  s damn difficult  keep smacking controllers together  always use teleport locomotion  smooth game makes sick
thats fucking hilarious
hand steering instead head steering works better locomotion  try 
people nt experience vr motion sickness  one  thousands hours vr  never felt  jumping  flying  shot cannon  driving car  nothing 
 hell people get used locomotion  immediately get dizzy moment try  takes time adapt  short session turn long session time 
used feel way  brain learns adapt  go away sessions  re struggling try using crystallized ginger ginger nutritional supplements help eliminate nausea 
normally get seasick  cause m new vr jumped straight smooth locomotion  nearly fell times never uncomfortable
looked seated mode   gave usual height hack openvr advanced settings  offsets 
thanks comment  ve got 4770k wondering 
surprised  s well optimized  m running ultra gtx 1070  i76700k  16gb ram performance graph showing steady 8ms response time spikes 
 oculus cv1 resolution steam vr settings 60hz mode play problem   mean oculus cv1 resolution  hp set well 1440  try keep everything 90hz mode  60  i similar specs m really interested details 
performance game blown mind  fog  lighting  shadows  insane detail objects  physics  s runs better vr games 
s odd m running hardware minimum s running like hot garbage 
left controller hold small menu button next thumbstick
yes  smooth locomotion works thumb sticks  parts use blink  like jumping ducking certain obstacles 
looks works fantastic o
played og odyssey  plays perfectly 
best experience o far  valve incredible job optimizing game wmr 
valve tested extensively many different headsets  works great wmr 
say wow  ridiculously immersive  running perfectly og odyssey gtx 1070  although get low video memory error startup far tell nt affecting anything   fence  favor get 
90  time  go slow let go 
time really issues ducking cover trying reload  game definitely nt know backpack would case 
yes played seated though need manually enable crouching feature ingame  accessibility  menu iirc also steamvr input bindings  playable seated  s valve firstparty title s available steam 
got little space move around m set standing  reorient couple time getting close shelves wall  otherwise still enjoyable 
ve playing couch laptop sitting front coffee table  definitely something huge problem vr games  drop something falls coffee table rl pita get  gravity gloves pretty much solves problem  also default setting crouched since rl sitting hmd orientation  went accessibility options switched height adjust  stand   setting enabled use left touchpad toggle standing crouching 
imo buy game steam whenever possible  better return policy ms  actually get refunds   viveport seems pointless s steam app links steam games

try loading game controllers main screen turn  ’ work make sure controllers tracked correctly start hla log  problem hands game behind reason  site
would think 1060 might barely able play  got rid rx 580 5700xt preparation game lol
playing 970 works ok s better skyrim vr psvr ps4 pro  stutter  nt tweaked settings yet  easily best optimized vr game ve seen  shocked smooth runs 
absolutely give go  played first 78 hours 1060 3gb  i5 3550 cpu   obviously s ideal areas framerate holds  little difficult open combat sequences gets fairly choppy  regardless game looks great even running low sertings
ll definitely work great 1060 3gb cpu nt bottleneck 
 want  badly  ve got 1060 3gb    m tempted try anyway though  2 hours gameplay return run well  enough time figure want keep   edit found   low vs ultra geforce gtx 1060 3gb performance review experience playing halflife  alyx geforce gtx 1060 3gb going low fps 31 frames per second  result taken high graphics screen resolution 1080p  lieu results would recommend geforce gtx 1060 3gb run halflife  alyx 1440p  bring graphics settings medium certainly get suitable 35 fps  point worth considering 1080p  ultra 1080p geforce gtx 1060 3gb get 22 fps running halflife  alyx  summary  might tempted play halflife  alyx 1440p resolution geforce gtx 1060 3gb  feel best placed running 1080p  could get following frame rates  low setting  58 fps  medium setting  46 fps  high setting  31 fps  ultra setting  22 fps  https  wwwgamedebatecomlowvsultragraphicssettings36729halflifealyx3656geforcegtx10603gb
games rather nebulous weird stuff going world halflife  experience first time player nt different  overall  hell going  vibe intentional 
ofc still loads fun detail gameplay  missing investment story little things game shows 
ll lot fun  much re returning player  goodbad literally know re missing  re never going play hl1 hl2  wo nt know supposed reference  wo nt able put certain clues together foreshadow later events  still follow plot 
recapped plots games read key characters  locations  factions  species feel pretty solid  m sure s plenty callbacks m missing though 
 wmr freezes screen seconds makes want barf  m getting mine  fades grey room holomap 
yeah  shotgun especially would benefit pavlovstyle grabbing 
card got
nt know head crab s put hard hat fun saved barnacle 
seem far afraid making someone sick  need get idea people new vr adapt  vr legs thing nt gotten yet likely target demographic  want inclusive  seems like much tech demo  open throttle show us really re afraid people getting sick  assume people figure adapt 
oh thank god thought something wrong right controller  left one smooth  right one snap turn wo nt turn  guess could power  play doom patch 
’ made game  bound bugs others would fixed 
since smooth turn one biggest sickness inducers  imagine figured disabling option small percentage audience stomach worth risking less informed players trying bad experience  said  s easy implement guarantee existed early builds eliminated playtesting 
optional 
used hand steering first started playing vr  playing boneworks started using head steering walk reload time  takes getting used  worth 
 flip upside sairento hours 
set steam ss make 1100x1100 instead 1440 headset settings windows switch hmd 60hz instead 90 ve read people sensitive ca nt use 60 nt nt notice makes run really smooth  run 90hz reprojection forced set low graphics  60 set medium quality reprojection auto case dips seems maintain 60 pretty easily  😊
specs  lower steam ss 1100x1100
thanks ll try 
’ good  smooth turning easy fix soon
confirm  o user works amazing  loving valve taking time include wmr compatibility 
’ running original odyssey  might take plunge tonight 
o user well  game looks amazing  controls work good  sometimes ll items fall instead going backpack  95  time works correctly  m sure headsets would work similarly 
ohh wow  sure would  sweet 
maybe help  cant figure jump 
slow  really  experience games 60minutes hl would say one fluid motion  stopping way  shoulder works every time  ps  fair  dropped item sholder  insted dropping backpack  happened
s like 10  time  maybe need keep practicing build stronger understanding get sweet spot interact  heard s supposed minor vibration sensation re right place  nt think feel  also heard works better go quickly instead slowly  extent experience  times nt seem work 
options sooo counterintuitive 
read something stand crouch controls left one let crouch  right one button let stand makes sense  probably end  reverb cable thick ll probably end paying seated 
makes sense  never used steam vr room since used headset flight simultions  nt difficult set  looking forward trying game point 
yeah  m temped plunk cash give shot  worst case ll game whenever upgrade gpu  s like m going buy  fuck  s halflife game  s like asking someone  want million dollars    bear shit woods  pope catholic  kind stupid question 
thanks  found link  seems s estimate  resolutions given flat panel displays  vr headset uses 1080p   p alyx nt available pancake displays   p
one autogenerated articles  s 1080p1440p stuff  leave auto automatically adjusts resolution keep needs 
gtx 950
also put respirator masks addition hardhat  believe adds two layers barnacle protection 
thing playtest crazy amount  s important part valve s develooment cycle  get large sample size people figured want make games around  opposite opinion tech demo thing really  tells re afraid enforcing limits game s mechanics compromises design  s something would nt expected valve reasons  wish could smash headcrabs without wasting ammo  maybe next hlvr game 
nt know expectig game almost perfect  kind tell wasnt  beginning game said something like   x years fall   something hapened half life 2 imediatly ideea going newcommer certantly feel  wtf valve   play 2  maybe probably play cronologicaly 
added option smooth testing  saw today  still working  100  bug  top  save load      restart chapter finish today either  hope save load next time play 
yeah  could make like barnacle pull feature 
definitely helpful comment  ve fence whether run  ve got i56600 rx480 8gb graphics  also 16gb ram  m thinking could probably actually run game 
thanks man  m going try settings  leave game graphic settings medium 
also  whats benefit setting resolution  thought read somewhere  auto  actually best way set res  also  res settings  actually set 1076 per eye 1116   way get bang 1100 see  
ryzen 7 3800x 16gb ram rx590 8gb
 deleted 
jump  teleport  right stick 
yeah  stuck  pull back  towards  right thumb stick  counterintuitive  🤷‍♂️
always go quickly far always worked   hmd ca nt track controller back takes long loses s position   swing controller shoulder  grab release  swing back front  s motion use space pirate trainer grab shield back 
would nt use right pad  s already assigned selecting weapons multitool like way 
simply refund game steam within first 2 hours playtime  within 14 days  nt work 
damn ’ tough
thought respirator head crabs  noticed one jumped mask fallen emitting green gas 
imagine messed game balance  example  ravenholm balanced encourage gravity gun kills  ll bet anything allowing physical attacks discouraged gun use play testing enough completely destroy wanted balance enemy encounters item drops 
made half life games free play like 2 months prior reason exactly 
called hl3 
lower resolution less taxing rig turn settings yeah set closest could res although tried closest could get 1400 today still ran fine medium settings 
dang  thats weird 
m convinced  s downloading 
nt like bone works  look alyx 
s wrong boneworks  crouch  force grab  actually offers sitting options instead making dig labyrinthine menus  s like  game  ca nt even smooth turning right 
yeah put mags backpack without even thinking  must picked 50 resin mags far noticed dropping one  noise get drop backpack successfully  listen good go  move controller next ear let go 
really  need run game medium settings  real tweaks game steam needed 
tell  runs fine enough time ll walk room ll like 2 fps  s irritating 
yep  nothing common  alyx gorgeous amazing level  story sound design  even close similar 
pretty much nt tried 90hz though m playing 60hz reprojection set auto
ryzen 2700 r9 390 checking  runs mostly fine low  occasional stutter  pretty bad medium 
 m getting flickering one eyes
 reprojection set auto exactly check setting  thanks info 
hm  verified game seems much better  pretty graphically intensive segment occurred almost issue  guess worked 
latest steamvr beta per app vr settings menu also config file located steamapps mixed reality vr driverresourcessettings folder  open default vr settings file note pad set motion reprojection mode line auto  switch motion reprojection indicator enabled line true see s working  👍
s short clip running low 60 hz 1100x1100 res yesterday get idea expect   video 60hz low settings 1100 resolution   https  streamablecomn850h  m running medium 1400 x 1400 res still running smooth 
yeah  reprojection disabled setting auto might help  get nauseous playing smooth locomotion 
yeah gotten used ago games nt really played much tried bone works couple weeks back got lot motion sickness  tried half life thing nt really want stop playing building tolerance lol 
hah  yeah pretty much  using teleport first thought put big boy pants go hand led smooth  could nt play long  real difficulty awkwardness teleport far 
anyone know stop annoying click sound windows makes  even sounds m ingame  never happened updated windows 10 version 2004 
""
mute volume mixer  right click speaker bottom right desktop   wmr blank logo text volume mixer s really annoying m sure s better way  s ve  beats hearing clicky clicks vr
yea real annoying uselless really dont see point thing 
wait year 2005 edition
figured bug  since nt always 
mine nt  maybe already changed setting  maybe related overall windows sound theme   always set windows no sounds  instead windows default 
holy shit tought issue somehow created  thanks info lads 
wish could turn wmr sounds  sound repeated 1000 times becomes annoying even nt misophonia  headset sounds even worse laptop sounds location  originate  one s skull
take 90  wmr software  7 clicks room setup  place shortcut launch program  launch entire program change floor height  point ball seconds input  desktop window launch every time try launch program  wmr software automatically start computer many people  wmr portal one greatest frustrations vr  s beyond asinine design  d love floating menu total darkness  anything would improvement 
windows version year would start 21 first two digits year  last two digits month  going release date 
face problem op already changed sound profile  guess ll trying mute wmr portal next time 
totally agree  would love theyd get rid itit would soo mutch better could change floor hight without needing restart steam vr least would nt close pop back done  also nt room setup rift  really hard use cameras controllers draw boundries  personally nt even use anyway  floor setup pull trigger actually accept nt wait like 4 sec accept  click orb  really hope reverb 2 gon na see better compatibility steam vr well improvements software  wmr would 10x better werent awful software  one example poor software change lighting room  actually almost every launch  doesnt find tracking  lounch floor height setup suddenly issue finding tracking  like ca nt steam vr  theres stupid virtual monitors 
yes room setup worst  tbh think would beter wmr would native steam vr headsets
floor height adjustment  place one controller ground  light ring   s really easy adjust floor position clips  automate process  set controller ground  would auto adjust floor 
think microsoft general terrible design ve monopoly position long nt give shit  windows ui great example  core design unchanged since windows 95  besides visual changes added shortcuts  since windows 8  ui mess original windows mixed new touchscreenoriented ui  s two completely different ui designs mashed together  majority world currently forced deal 
ve begging black void since beginning  new reverb feel like hostages cuz competition 
oh shit  thought releasing thing random ass numbers
windows 98 windows 2000 windows windows xp windows vista windows 7 windows 8 windows 10 windows 2005 windows 2105 windows 2205
aw bummer  sound even games 
muted consistently games  hl alyx ok  beat saber hear click

m hard time removing forehead padding  trick 
experience touchpad false contact issue  right touchpad sometimes shows contact 6  ’ touching
thanks posting  issue back could nt find anyone fixed online  eventually fixed  using hot glue instead tape   s good post clearly describes fix 
darn  first post newer web interface dragged photo appears cleared written instructions photos  forehead padding pulls straight front back  3 layers forehead assembly  outer plastic    wiring sandwiched  inner plastic attached 8 philips  1 screws   padding press fit snaps inner plastic  slid nylon spudger fabric inner plastic gently pulled back uniformly possible  lots thin plastic blade guide tabs circular press fit tubes hold time fix spent pausing wondering pulling hard enough going break  required force unsnapping long john rear panel  2 less raincoat snap perhaps imagine outhouse really needing go still wanting stay dry 
mine randomly  reboot system cleaning alcohol wipe fixed
issue worse controller turning due particular contact issue  made post fix   https  wwwredditcomrwindowsmrcommentscti0ldsamsungodysseycontrollerrepairteardown   https  wwwredditcomrwindowsmrcommentscti0ldsamsungodysseycontrollerrepairteardown 
particular touchpad many touchpad issues fixed damp high quality microfiber cloth  alcohol sometimes help  usually leave last resort oleophobic coatings damaged surface ends needing frequent cleanings 
welcome  ran issue could nt find anyone fixed  rma s nt option atm due covid  fix hot glue possibly better depending bend tape position original wiring  concern would glue delaminating plastic shifting stresses super tiny audio cables would frustrating fix break  enough glue prevent connector stresses large enough glob shift forehead band  cable stresses onto glue wires come 
clean outside  let alcohol get inside 
mine also started managed hit metal plate  could never tear apart joystick external cover  couldnt find nice spudger  ifixit doesnt ship  tried cheap chinese ones broke tries stick em  ill probably use sharp knife next time problem like open  thanks 
many thanks  give try
 poured little old clothing cleaned  little alcohol seakage shouldnt hurt  dont pour anyways 
controller face cover real pain basically thin sturdy  spudger like  thing work  careful knife though  plastic medal nt mix well maybe m uncoordinated ve poor luck using knives tech repair  got couple little scars fingers haha 
yeah got ta really careful  end even cut fingers feel sad cosmetics  really dont like damaging plastic shells  ones controllers special  lol tip  maybe always use old razors dealing plastics  even dull rusty ones dremel use plastic  might come handy

good tip guys  glad someone noticed headphones suck  valve index ones suck  beeing praised good  simply missing deep bass that´s needed really impressive soundstage obligatory vr  deep bass vr like going movie theater soundstage tv     epo   done  bass definitely  better  course still good enough  akg headphones cant´t get lower 50hz  really roomfilling deep bass explosions sound like explosions  epo can´t make something stronger headphones simply can´t reach  also usb power limited headphones  every bit bass you´re adding epo lost volume  loudness correction wont help  really interested vr really sound like  buy headbuds htc vive       seem perfectly balanced vr  tuning epo necessary  you´ll wind extra audiocable around headsetcable though connector odyssey  one every headset every manufacturer  vivebuds like 8 bucks aliexpress they´re probably underrated cheapest upgrade vr experience  favour  thank later

oh gosh  awesome new whole audiophile thing  got dank pods approved iems really disappointed headset experience made beat saber infinitely better thank much 
concerning loud audio noise   using powered usb 3 hub triggered noise immediately  using three different brands models less  trying ones kids   changing extension cord something shorter  skipping hub  remove long time  atm getting noise ca  per hour  suspect ’ partially software problem   yes  turned usb power saving windows settings  given cv1 audio worked perfectly machine and used lot usb power running 3 sensor setup  and ’ common problem  common broken cv1 speakers shitty crinkly cables though   ’ say audio one big obvious design flaw two  small big heads second one  said  ’ pretty much favorite hmd  ’ tried index though 
helpful  thanks op  long run  audio blows skirt  going buy separate headphone dac headphone amp  even low impedance cans like grados benefit solid hp amp  used cost thousands  today good enough hp amp 100 bucks stay good enough next sets better cans   audiophiles  relying fancy motherboards chip even fancy sound card nt call audiophile 
little surgery remove stock crappy headphones use nice set  nt ton screws  phillips nt need take whole headset apart cut wires  remove built headphones  use cable sleeving neatly bind headset headphone cable profit  go deaf blind vr     edit    reversible well  thing note wmr sets default audio  mic audio  headset  need manually switch back every time use headset  sure could fixed  lazy  switch audio back time 
current settings getting clipping  sounds way better  good advice though see adjust preamp eq get rid red  hope others find better setting post 
would give try  might need adjust bass much pic flat eq stock speaker improved much better cushions  addresses source mix 
headphones odyssey go 20hz sound generally pretty bassy  maybe re wearing wrong  bass first thing get s lost loose fit 
correct  also wanted improve comfort since flat cushions mod bothers  believe ve seen cushions deeper mod job 
semiaudiophile great small speaker rig soso larger one  5 subwoofers  must say headphones odyssey definitely suck  s idiotic  paid 230shipping expensive options sounds like literal shit  could better  however  see decent  baseline acceptable  would love use sennheisers  whatever  position sensitive could use equalizer mid range  windowsmr sounds absymal sound signature demonstrated sub days ago  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vohh1xqkjwcw
even  hairtie  mod presses ear  even used doublehairties  pressed almost level beeing uncomfortabel  still satisfied  really think able position phones right ears     d ok 
well  audiophile must say suck  don´t suck casual use  casual use even rift built phones good  simple test 4 though phantastic phones ody  simply download amoreon club demo  free steam  listen odyssey  plug really good phones soundcard put scene  listen tracks tell us one creates atmosphere ones suck  please answer honest   semihonest  
 odyssey  headphones go 20 hz headphones cut 50 hz would really weird defect  assume 
sennheiser momentum d love fit  sound nt outrageous means  paid 230 plus shipping  m complaining headphones price point  say fantastic  take stick ass   casual use even rift built phones good  fact well worse higher price point      sucks  get reference point  fucking idiot   please answer honest   semihonest   re crying part  re pathetic  kid 
hearing wmr home clicking sound steam vr game
sometimes headset freeze second  comes back ll hear wmr clicking sound inside steam vr  full pc reset fix issue

hey  overall ve quite happy odyssey honestly nt played nearly much d like  cord fucking short  fuck could nt give ability swap nt fucking clue  worse  cable autokinks cord ve ever owned  try straight re blue face balls yet  turn back one fucking beardsecond s kinked  s fucking cord s going jefferyepstein s sad exist pathetically short cord  ve already blown much cash two different usb 3 extension cables neither works worth shit corrupt audio  one s amazon basics s active repeater cost 4x much  nt lot disposable cash  m really fucking frustrated ca nt simply buy extension cable damn thing actually enjoy 
usb 30 length limitations wmr cables length  s also common usb 30 ports mobo s supply enough power  s ms s fault   like others stated s almost always necessary use powered usb 30 hub andor usb 30 expansion card  also trying use extensions longer 6ft likely problems 
share frustration  tried several recommended usb extensions powered hubs  still anything 3 feet get corrupted audio  power saving changes  one thing seem noticed posts appears must put extension pc powered hub  real solution re dragging around hub power cord within length builtin cable trying extend  plus hub power cable going shorter extension anyway  much length benefit  next last step get pcie card see  entirely possible onboard usb ports nt enough juice stability

buy 5v powered usb 3 splitter box solve audio issues extensions  bought three mentioned failed   cords plenty long  rig system ceiling eliminate lot kink issues

lol  realized posted exact ones  also use without issue 
s impossible say need powered hub shorter cables without simply trying first  important powered usb 30 hub usb 30 hub  also note vive link box use included usb cable 20 30 link box also require external power plug much like powered usb 30 hub  far cables go  used 6ft amazon basics cables work fine

til  sound apps  3d  positional vr
playing hot dogs horse shoes  hand grenades decided would cool listen music set mood  launched spotify put half life music play  picked spotify window threw far away behind would nt get way noticed turning around putting window far sound would become lower seemed like actually coming behindupside blew mind    x200b  love wmr features 
want learn  look “ head related transfer function vr ” “ binaural audio vr ”  binaural audio general term “ truly 3d ” sound recorded generated way simulate sound actually arrives ears  opposed panning signal  head related transfer functions mathematics behind understanding simulating effect 
think microsoft actually missed spot  albeit niche one  360 player addon edge browser allows view 360 videos vr  nt actually rotate audio stage  360 videos directional audio  hear 3d effect rotating mouse headset  probably way priority list though 
way audio something like spotify positional  want background music want music 
blew mind first time realized  moved window around s really accurate simulation   cool stuff 
work songs recorded stereo  spotify window like big floating stereo radio 
s around ages  even original unreal tournament option use  wish every game used  requires regular stereo headphones find perceived 3d positioning audio sources far better surround sound 
think open app desktop control desktop view  use window inside wmr become positional

fix static lenovo explorer audio
like many others  found plugging headphones audio jack would almost always cause horrific static noise would unusable  poking around settings  tried something seems worked  went settings  navigated sound clicked sound control panel   found audio device  realtek usb 20 audio   double clicked open settings  navigated advanced changed sample rate bit depth  2 channel  16 bit  48000 hz   clicked apply  nt know much sound m assuming lowering quality sound takes strain usbs workload  nt get horrific static noise  let s honest  lower sound quality small price pay eardrums obliterated  let know works others  ll update post anything changes solutions found  
audio dac headset  frankly  utter sh  t causes static end  dac going haywire  lowering maximum bitrate forces windows audio subsystem mangle audio stream hardware actually able support rather send  high dynamic range  data ca nt properly process 
ll try explorer 3m extensions recently got  s static city  powered usb hub yet  audio quality  cd audio 16bit 44100hz  studios export music specs  sounds great  higher bits sampling rates important audio production  simply data audio processing  effects  music listening  nt make audible difference  technically lowering sound quality dropping bits hz  practically wo nt hear difference  audiophiles may argue lol 
struggled issue ages resorted plugging headphones directly pc temporary fix  think ve cracked though  static week  pc usb 31 gen 1 usb 31 gen2 ports  know   using gen 2 port  switching gen 1  blue  earsplitting static gone  hope helps someone else

lenovo explorer loud static sound usb hub
hi everyone  common problem loud static sound 2 minutes using headset audio  thing  bought powered usb 30 hub internet solutions said  problem persists using externally powered usb hub  tried different usb ports usb 30 devices plugged  anyone maybe advice  mb  asus z170 pro gaming usb hub  ginzzu gr384uab
using extension cables hub 
plugged external power supply usb 30 powered hub right  ask powered hubs actually come power supply

hey man  made post may fix issue  https  wwwredditcomrwindowsmrcommentseoaj8tfixforstaticonlenovoexploreraudio  utmmediumandroidapp  utmsourceshare worth shot
 hub connected mobo backpanel lenovo explorer connected hub 
yes  reason bought power headset   tested  plugging power supply first  without data  charging accumulators hub  works  connected pc headset  thing think s psu  5v 21a  still enough 
well  would buy extension cable headset 1 jack mic headphones short cable  bought use lenovo explorer  cable splitter  whole vr thing quickly exceeds initial expectations money time trial error

black airpods colorware diy job  looks good 
point using buds connected short cable  would get bored charge 2 extra devices setup 
 deleted 
transmitter volume obnoxiously low  inc 
interesting  currently use sony xm3s amazing anc would love use wireless earbuds feel freer  way secure airfly duo  feel like something big dangling would really annoying move around may keep hitting headset cause unequal weight distribution 
d love ca nt justify paying  120 audio solution paying  300 wired headphones around  good news airpods already  though 
fiil t1xs able connect directly q2 worked well using ear buds almost every play session 
would work without transmitter moviesvideos  heard makes games lag vids 
tried taotronics transmitter latency  airpod pro ’ ’ support aptx 
expensive imagined would  50 bucks   thanks  might pick start travel
connect via bluetooth  s ve discovered works bose qc headphones  however ve tested bigscreen  games  seemed fine  saying latency much bluetooth games like beatsaber 
wonder airfly classic low latency duo version  nt need support 2 headphones aptx low latency  however  classic bt4 whereas duo bt5 
tried airpods pro latency issue  even video  thanks tip  ll give airfly try 
bought airfly duo use airpods pro arrived today  re low latency  still noticeable lag  s bad enough ruin beat saber  though iirc beat saber audio delay setting might allow cancel   s still perfectly acceptable games precise audio sync nt important  thought d warn people buy one  personally  nt regret  ll still able use games latency nt matter  devices 
 deleted 
received airfly duo today must say disappointed  pairing airpods pro problem  audio way low  bit louder internal speakers  also audio drops sometimes even max volume quieter scenes  latency bad  tried thumper s kind noticeable definitely playable  return  guess cheaper bluetooth transmitter exact job  look another solution 
re connecting airpods way  headset use mic airpods  still use built mic 
work 2 gen airpods walmart onn knock airpods   work audio mic work well used using virtual desktop  im trying find best possible audio solution use steamvr vrchat 
colorware  expensive  fantastic job
used use small short earbuds q1  ’ kind annoying  sometimes feel cable  needed take headset quick second push second buds pull ear  things always bugged   much better  also really like active noise canceling vr 
yep  ’ using triple driver inears ear cable  works sounds fantastic  tons bass  crystalline treble balanced round 
yes different app games unplayable  theres ton delay connect directly quest 
combination  ’ issue  cheaper transmitter tried q1 first  q2 release  issue  volume low  still tiny bit latency  one many amazon cheap device different names 
little piece velcro arm  white velcro better 
took monoprice velcro cable tie wrapped around arm airfly duo  audio jack anchors one end velcro cable tie holds arm  s s light s completely unnoticeable  weighs 15 grams 
tried couple different earbuds directly q2 beat saber ’ cope well  seems try slow latency  ends running 10 fps something 
connect q2  q2 supported bluetooth headphone 
videos youtube amazon prime app beeing sncyed bluetooth latency quest 2 airpods pro  works great vids  
’  sure protocol airfly duo using allows airpods low latency  tried 3 different transmitters 3 different earbudsheadphones  combination worked flawlessly  ’ pair different set cheaper headphones see work well airfly 
oh yeah  picked sale  40  fly often work  get use delta entertainment system well  worked well  cheaper ones amazon mentioned ’ sync audio delta system either  lip syncing issue  device perfectly matched 
yes  beat saber actually unique problem  try try demo  slows 10 fps trying match audio  games bad bluetooth connected directly 
think bt5 critical  advantage duo usbc charging  could actually charge quest short usbc usbc use usb charger quest 
’ sucks  ’ notice delay beat saber  small bit latency pinball fx2 vr noticed last night  ’ edit post warn people 
bluetooth transmitters seem cut volume low  downside sure 
sorry hear  volume fine  cheaper bluetooth devices latency make useless  least experience  even ones claim aptx paired aptx earbuds  gave latency problems  ’ edit post make sure people understand ’ working well others 
idea  send headset back oculus warranty repair ’ check time soon  sorry  actually  ’ think  ’ really  headphone jack bluetooth dongle ’ enough segments support mic line  3 segments would left  right  common 
’ good answers  ’ use solution anymore  small latency bugged much  sorry 
 replace battery die 
ok noise canceling probably sweet  hope eventually make bluetooth work headphone 
shame low latency bt codecs 
 hmm   https  iimgurcomxbjzn3gjpg  guess got really lucky  damn would love acceptable volume airpod pros using transmitter
nt tried beat saber ll give shot see get results  know put headphones low latency mode app phone usually helps games videos 
yes go settings option connect gamepad put headphones pairing mode pick signal 
could aac thought latency 
bought last night actually give go  thanks info man 
good points  turns pro version actually lower price duo right includes receiver well  specs duo  ordered pro 
nt worry  worth shot return  really wonder volume  volume lot louder internal speakers  also find quest 2 speakers quite step quest 1  terms volume sound quality  yeah re probably right latency cheaper devices  even though airpods pro nt use aptx considerably lower latency least airpods 1 2 remember seeing table latency numbers 
ah darn  thanks anyhow
 ’ guessing might able repaired  ’ imagine would last long enough purchasing new set would likely 
nope  airpods 
based line review  person says “ takes long time pair  ” ’ know  volume issue could airpods transparency mode something like  volume good 
actually  headset experimental features  even change options bluetooth audio  sadly  still causes tons problems beat saber 
yeah  good luck  got amazon  return policy godsend stuff like 
got pro version sale  44  works better streamers ve tried slight latency  much less pairing headset directly  suitable games  however  nt see clear advantage convenience wired earbuds  m going use airfly mostly tv streamer 
yes  airpods pro volume louder built speakers  airpods noise cancelling  sure ’ louder  using quest 2 tonight noticed latency seemed improve even  playing almost link games noticed pinball fx2  gave little latency native quest 2  perfect link  also updated software public test channel quest oculus pc software  maybe improved things  sure  agree quest 2 speakers better quest 1 infinitely better rift s still good enough though use time imho  sold index ordering quest 2 really miss speakers 
holy crap   390 battery dead toss  wow 
oh wow sold index  well even compared index resolution specs quest 2 kind crazy  course convenience  tried oculus link briefly  mostly virtual desktop native apps latency dealbreaker  actually impressed vd picture quality   rift guess link enhance sound windows settings gives pretty huge volume boost 
yeah  mean  colorware expensive like said  decide think ’ worth   hate look white airpods   ’ mind paying  150 premium painted  tried vinyl decals first looked terrible  nobody makes good skins airpods pro yet  regular airpods  skins perfect 
 deleted 
yeah  index collecting dust basement travel work  quest go  figured resolution improvement quest 2 along 90hz pcvr support future enough sell index use quest 2 messing link bitrate settings last night  pretty impressed  ’ index level clarity ’ ever seems  however  certainly rift level clarity latency near nonexistent  virtual desktop wireless benefit great  still enough latency bug  plus trouble steam games  like longbow experience lab lot odd audio visual glitches though vd fine link  get 90hz working higher bitrate default  along good index level speakers like vr ears marketing  close enough 
  ’ mind paying  150 premium painted s pair new standard airpods wireless case though  appreciate ferrari without wanting one  colorware look night day better black
still getting 56 hours great  1st gen airpods last 90 minutes 
wish apple offered black  would make wallet happier
sure  d really like normal airpods black price

 afaik  home screen get voice  videos games captured recorded nt capture voice  bizarre

way download audio drivers quest get 360 sound quest  tried steel series pro attached pc vs quest sound much better pc nt know need amp s bc software
""
plausible way friend  windows software 360 sound  option could think may work cast quest pc use audio pc  latency probably kill option though  aside nt another option think 
adding pseudo 71 surround processing top vr headset s compex positional processing would bizarre  sounds like re altered eq profile though  unfortunately nt think software solution exists quest  root ever obtained would allow changes  leaves hardware solution  means transforming sound via use portable dacampeq like shure sha900  much cheaper equivalent choosing  
might need set audio output quest steelseries software razer headphones know software different might issue
man sucks s pretty big difference tried side side 
dts headphone x ss headphones  vr headset s compex positional processing  thing   pseudo 71 surround processing  
ca nt access software plugged quest s issue  m using without plugging pc
yeah similar set  use virtual desktop  playing steam games  much immersive  q1  going 71 surround regular stereo kills lot  q2 done upgrade might gotten 
speaking specifically quest 2  work preprocessed stereo output 35mm jack  dts processing stereo signal absolutely pseudo surround 
maybe s something sidequest
say  ca nt even use quest 2 nothing said makes sense  go downvoting
android app process 71 surround  work  possibly viper4android  may need root  one day maybe 
reason op hearing difference sound quality pc quest  headphones work via 35mm jack  steelseries software unique eq profile  dts headphone x vs oculus  home brand hrtf processing unavailable variable consider  s point even going  eq profile quest altered  portable dacamp fitted line quest output headphones achieve similar result  letting pump bass  drive bigger headphones  whatever want  arguing completely irrelevant shit  downvoted 
maybe oculus add

empiezo ahora armarla  mi primer build  para producción de audio gaming ocasional  si explota  doy por contento

empiezo pensar que ultimamente todos compraron pc de compragamer con el aguinaldo  les demoró 7 semanas en llegar lo postean ahora cuando recién llegó en definitiva  f aguinaldo
tené mucho ojo con la gigabyte esa  las g1 son notorias por tener mala refrigeración pasta de dientes por pasta térmica  yo carbonice una vega 56 la rx580 de un amigo recalienta como loca  le di una mano le cambié la pasta de dientes por mx4 bajó como 15 grados 
alegra mucho saber que la gente puede comprarse estás cosas disfrutarlas en estos momentos  pongo contento por todo el que pueda 
ufff que bestia que armaste felicidades que lindo ese gabinete yo tuve que comprar una poronga sobreprecio por la falta de stock suerte armando dale buen uso
olvidé de poner el disco  que ya lo tenía de la vieja pc  crucial bx500 480gb ssd  en cuanto pueda le agrego un m2  tal vez en un año cuando termine de pagar todo  jaja
que groso  una consulta  ¿en que hay que concentrarse al armar una compu de producción de audiovídeodiseño digital  ¿me imagino que procesador ram 
fuente gamemax  explotar pero fuera de joda  felicitaciones
felicitaciones lince  lindo maquinon  te dejo mis 10 papá
que divina maquina te vas armar    una pregunta  porque decidiste comprar una radeon rx una nvidia rtx  mucha diferencia de precio  por el salto generacional digo
duda  donde conseguiste la rx580  estoy buscando una hace rato encuentroestán muy infladas de precio 
muy buena  felicitaciones
que bueno  dónde conseguiste el h510 
el aguinaldo fue vital
mas menos se esta solucionando los problemas de compragamer  el problema ahora son los de oca
uh  lo voy tener en cuenta  muchas gracias 
tendría que ver como hacer eso  ya ví que calienta bastante  ver si informo aprendo hacerlo  excelente data pasaste 👍
que agradable sujeto  por más gente como vos
muchas gracias 
muchas gracias 
acordate que sea m2 mvme  xq los otros m2 tienen diferencia un ssd  ojo con eso  ver  hay diferencia pero muy muy mínima
exacto  procesador  mucha ram  ahora tengo 16  pero en cuanto pueda le agrego 16 más  ssd  los hdd son muy lentos para audio   una buena tarjeta de sonido  yo uso una externa usb  focusrite scarlett 2i4   esto para audio  para editar video  sabría decirte
jajaja  gracias 
mn vos decis que es mala esa fuente porque planteo comprarla para un ryzen 5 3600 una r9 290 que tengo todo se va full 500w
ahí terminé  explotó 😊
gracias capo 
la verdad que las rtx que vi parecieron caras para mi presupuesto  como va ser para producción de audio gaming ocasional  soy muy gamer   decidí por la rx580 
mercado libre  vi una oferta en cuotas con interés que pareció bajo  pero ya está la publicación
muchas gracias

yo tengo una rx580 si  calienta un montón  pero haciendo undervolt ajustando la curva de fans anda perfecto es una excelente grafica  suerte con el armado  hermosa pc 
si  da gusto gente así  un capo
si  muchas gracias por el consejo  lo voy tener en cuenta 👍
qué dawprogramas utilizas  porque un amigo anda en la misma de armarse una pc para prod  musical
si podés compra una de una marca de mejor reputación  por las dudas más que nada  es que la conectas explota todo la mierda  pero la larga le va reduciendo la vida útil los componentes 
alegro  zafaste
claro ta perfecto  encima dsp si quisieras podes aumentar tranquilamente

pero tarda un mes aprox

gracias  el único problema que tuve es que reconocía una de las dos ram  martillé un poco reconoció las dos 😂
si  soy experto en placas de video  la verdad  pero creo que para el uso que le voy dar  esta está bien  lo único que espero es que dure
por el mismo precio  mas menos  podes comprar una 5500xt que rinde un cacho mas consume mucho menos

golpeé el escritorio se desinstalaron los drivers de audio de realtek¿ 
hace unas semanas cuando estaba en casa mi viejo limpio mi pieza  movió el gabinete que estaba en el piso rompió el cable hdmi  costa de eso tuve que subir el gabinete al escritorio usar un hdmi más corto  al día siguiente jugando algo  recuerdo qué  calenté golpeé la mesa para putear  para mí sorpresa se frizeó la pc entera al encenderla mágicamente reconocía los auriculares  indagando un poco descubrí que realtek dejo de existir en mi pc luego del hecho ocurrido con anterioridad  hice lo que haría cualquiera  reinstalar los drivers  pero sé instalaba  intenté usar la opción del administrador de dispositivos para instalar los drivers desde ahí  pero windows tiraba pantallazo azul  formateé reinstalé windows  nada pasó  dias después  sin aviso  mágicamente  mis auriculares funcionaban  ¿qué pasó  los drivers de audio de microsoft se instalaron  desde entonces puedo instalar los drivers de audio de realtek  lo único que veo en el administrador de dispositivos es el controlador de audio con un símbolo amarrilo con un signo de exclamación que da el código de error 10  básicamente  faltaban los drivers   pero como ya dije  puedo instalar los drivers  porque al hacerlo pide reiniciar la compu  al reiniciar nada pasa  si tienen alguna solución  se los agradezco 
observa con cuidado el mother  quizas alguno de los golpes daño algun el conector se despegó 
mi paso con una placa de video  golpee el escritorio magicamente dejo de funcionar  consejo  pegale la pared se te van ir las ganas de pegarle las cosas 
golpeá el escritorio de vuelta ver si se arregla 
lei esto parece un chiste  probaste formatear 
veces pasan ese tipo de cosas inexplicables  el otro día por ejemplo hubo un corte de luz la pc de mi hermana se le corrompió el servicio de windows que se encarga de administrar el wifi           le tuve que instalar windows de nuevo  la verdad que se que decirte
proba cambiar el disco rígido  lo mas probable que el disco se haya jodido después del golpe 
intentaste conectar los auriculares la salida del monitor para ver que pasa 
debe ser problema de disco rígido  porque la única forma de que golpeando que se congelé la pc pero que después funcione bastante bien debe ser que jodiste el disco  yo te recomendaría que te pases un ssd lo antes posible
en varias mothers  los capacitores grosos de las  placas de sonido  integradas  los fabricantes los situan en donde se les canta el or  o muchas veces los vi al lado del slot de la placa de video  cerca del borde en donde están las chapitas de los slots del gabinete  por eso  son propensos que se tuerzan se desuelden  una vez ayudando un amigo vimos eso  de los 4 capacitores grosos  2 estaban todos torcidos seguramente de alguna vez que cambiaron la gpu  la llevamos un técnico electrónico de confianza  clave eso  un  cambia placa de pc    confirmó que estaban desoldados  la reparó salió andando de una 
se pudo haber desoldado el conttrolador de realtek jajajaj
que se pudo desconectar de la mother 
pero deja ni instalar los drivers para realtek  eso es lo raro
lo intenté  pero funciona  
si  lo hice sin eliminar archivos justo el 24 lo hice pero formateo total  todo sigue igual
tengo 3 discos  2 conectados uno guardado en el ropero  ninguno tienen ningún tipo de problema
tendría nada que ver  puesto que el monitor está conectado la gráfica  la gráfica tiene sus propios drivers de sonido  pero aún así lo hice tengo problemas
vivo en argentina vivimos con el sueldo minino  cuando pueda laburar voy dar algunos lujos mientras ahoro para salir de latinoamérica
se divorció del father
mira los conectores  el hdmi los de audio 
el circuito integrado de realtek  quizá  suele estar cerca de las entradas de audio de la mother 
bajate driver booster en steam fijate si ai te deja
formateala completo  es una paja pero por ahi se soluciona  si tenes alguna cosa importanta ponela en la nube
probaste escanear  si el disco es rígido podés haber tenido la mala suerte de que se rompa un sector específico el resto anda perfecto 
cuidado que irse afuera de latinoamérica te garantiza que te vaya mejor  los que se van generalmente son ingenieros profesionales que acá ya están bastante bien  pero en otros lados seguramente se los valora mucho más 
la última vez que hice limpieza todo estaba en su lugar
lo hice  actualice los drivers  pero funcionó
ya lo dije  el 24 hice un formateo totalcompleto  quedó nada  reinstalé windows  ni así se arregló el problema
conoces algún programa gratuito seguro con el que pueda escanear  tengo mucha idea sobre el tema
pero miralos ahora  si cuando hiciste la limpieza le habías pegado el trompazo al escritorio  si 
reinstalar windows medio que descarta un problema de software  que falle la instalación del driver de audio apunta para el lado de una falla del hardware  probaste reseteando el bios buscando algun update  otra que se ocurre es hacer una downgrade de los drivers una versión vieja  para que funcione tenea que desintalar los drivers existentes pedir que los borre 
podés arrancar con la herramienta de windows  chkdsk   https  wwwionosesdigitalguideservidoresconfiguracioncomandoschkdsk 
lo hice luego del golpe  había nada fuera de lugar con referencia la limpieza que hice principio de año
lo de la bios lo quiero hacer por inexperiencia  lo de la actualización lo hice pero hay nada  los drivers se  quiero desinstalar la  controladora  en el administrador de dispositivos pero actualizo el administrador vuelve aparecer con el símbolo amarillo  tengo forma de desinstalar algún drivers existente
todo lo que es electrónica se rompe  veces sin ninguna razón aparente  llevalo un servicio técnico de confianza para que lo diagnostiquen 
cuando tenga plata lo hago
consulto aca porque en buildapc boludean se pasan de elitistas si pregunto alguna pavada  consulta sobre audio
toda mi vida conecte mis auriculares en los parlantes  el audio de los parlantes en si andan bien pero la entrada de auriculares de estos parlantes estan empezando andar mal  se donde conecta la mayoria sus auriculares  gustaria saber como hacen ustedes la mayoria  estaba viendo 2 opciones  conectar el auricular al frente del gabinete parlantes detras por la placa madre como siempre venia haciendo  pero escuche lei comentarios que el audio por el frente del gabinete puede ser peor que atras aveces puede sonar ruidos de estatica al estar protejido suele pasar seguido con gabinetes de medio pelo  el mio  nzxt h440  es tan de medio pelo pero tampoco te vuela la cabeza  todo esto que tan cierto es que tan seguido pasa  mi segunda opcion era comprarme otros parlantes pero aca mi otra duda  todos los auriculares al conectarlos los parlantes van sonar iguales mejor peor dependiendo de la calidad de los parlantes  es decir si el unico objetivo de los parlantes es usarlos como conector de auriculares es al pedo gastar plata de mas para buscar calidad de audio 
es más fácil más rápido hacer la prueba por vos mismo que escribir todo lo que escribiste  p conecta los auriculares en el gabinete  yo los tengo así  pone una canción  fíjate como suena  después conectalos en el mother  poné una canción  escuchá como suena determina vos que sonido te gusta más si hay una diferencia  yo tengo un headset sennheiser pc 310 g4me  un gabinete thermaltake urban t31 distingo la diferencia entre conectarlo en un lugar otro  en cuanto los parlantes yo tengo unos edifier c2 que tienen una potencia sub bufer  se escucha mucho más fuerte si los conecto ahí pero puedo conectar el micrófono además pierdo la función de tener dos salidas de audio por separado  en fin  diría que pruebes decidas por vos mismo amigo 
hola  de la primer opción tengo idea  en cuanto lo segunda opción  creo que los parlantes te definan la calidad de audio de los auris en cuanto tengan nada como  intermedio  entre la ficha el cable  con lo cual habría alteración por parte de estos así que solo serían un conector como decías  por último  te conviene comprar un adaptador para 2 fichas conectar al mismo tiempo auris parlantes en la parte de atrás del gabinete 
 conectar el auricular al frente del gabinete parlantes detras por la placa madre como siempre venia haciendo  pero escuche lei comentarios que el audio por el frente del gabinete puede ser peor que atras aveces puede sonar ruidos de estatica al estar protejido suele pasar seguido con gabinetes de medio pelo  el mio  nzxt h440  es tan de medio pelo pero tampoco te vuela la cabeza  todo esto que tan cierto es que tan seguido pasa  tenes que tener un componente muy choto en el camino del cable al conector  el gabinete tiene nada que ver menos que vendan gabinetes con caja de faraday para el camino del cable al frente  te puede sumar una interferencia pero el sonido se degrada  mi segunda opcion era comprarme otros parlantes pero aca mi otra duda  todos los auriculares al conectarlos los parlantes van sonar iguales mejor peor dependiendo de la calidad de los parlantes  es decir si el unico objetivo de los parlantes es usarlos como conector de auriculares es al pedo gastar plata de mas para buscar calidad de audio  depende 100  del circuito del parlante  lo que haces conectadolos ahi es usar el parlante de preamplificador  mas volumen   si el parlante es muy malo te puede meter distorsiones interferencias   es decir si el unico objetivo de los parlantes es usarlos como conector de auriculares es al pedo gastar plata de mas para buscar calidad de audio  aca parece tenes una ensalada de conceptos  el audio analogico se puede mejorar una vez que ya salio del mother  si le podes dar mas volumen  usando los parlantes de preamplificador  lo sumo lo podes equalizar un poco  pero se mejora  el audio de los parlantes en si andan bien pero la entrada de auriculares de estos parlantes estan empezando andar mal seguro alguna soldadura se te daño  mira videos de yt sobre como soldar revisalo es un lindo conocimiento que siempre te puede servir
te contesto lo mas bien el flaco de buildapc jaja es como te dijo  mientras mas cosas haya conectadas en el medio mas se va degradar la senal  igual tambien depende de tu sensibilidad la calidad de los parlantes auriculares 
sabes como se llaman estos adaptadores asi lo busco en ml  supongo que debe haber 
gracias che creo que es la respuesta mas completa entendible que recibi  osea que el sonido cuando se conecta al parlante se degrada  solo puede haber como sonidos raros   aca parece tenes una ensalada de conceptos  el audio analogico se puede mejorar una vez que ya salio del mother  si le podes dar mas volumen  usando los parlantes de preamplificador  lo sumo lo podes equalizar un poco  pero se mejora si esto lo sabia  pero referia si la calidad de sonido se degradaba por conectar los headsets al parlante
jaja igual habia preguntado antes pero lo borre porque habia mucha boludes pero lo volvi preguntar ese si respondio bien
https  articulomercadolibrecomarmla736421818adaptadorminiplug35stereoa2hembra35mmstereo1x2jm sería uno de estos  igualmente te convendría buscar en alguna tienda de electrónica hasta ferretería copada cercana donde vivas porque creo que valga la pena pagar envío de algo asi
te puede meter estaticas  silbidos  recortarte frecuencias  como puede pasar nada  depende de la calidad del parlante de los auris  igual si lo notas  te hagas la cabeza disfrutalo
problemas con el audio de mi pc
hola  armé una compu hace poco como soy nuevo en esto se muy bien que pasa  primero que nada en la parte frontal del gabinete funcionan todas las ranura excepto la del micrófono la del auricular  ya que al conectarlos  los reconoce la pc  también al probar con las ranuras de la parte trasera de la pc  si funcionan los auriculares pero el micrófono que tiene incluido   en windows tampoco lo reconoce como auricular con microfono   ese seria mi problema  perdón si es algo muy básico pero entiendo mucho todavía jajjajsa gracias por la ayuda 
revisaste de nuevo las conexiones  que auricular usas 
1  en el panel frontal los usb s los audios van por dos conectores distintos  que funcionen puede significar dos cosas  uno  que el hdaudio esté conectado  dos  que te falten los drivers de audio esté reconociendo que algo se haya enchufado  2  que conectes los auriculares con micrófono que funcione es normal  por algo la computadora tiene entrada de auriculares micrófono por separado vos sólo tenés un auxiliar en tu mano  deberías de comprar un 35mm jack splitter 
para que te ande el auri del celu necesitas esto https  articulomercadolibrecomarmla835260725cableadaptadoraudiominiplug35mmamicyauricularpcjm fijate en la web del fabricante del mother bajalo de ahi
adelante atras tenes para conectar microfono auriculares  si enchufas solo auris te va funcionar el microfono integrado
bueno si te anda viene tarjetas de sonido externas  osea un adaptador que se enchufa al usb
uso los que vienen con el celular que probándolos en otra compu funcionan perfecto
que cosa debería revisar de las conexiones  el hd audio 
ahora reviso las conexiones  ¿sabes que drivers de sonido deberia instalar en donde los puedo buscar  gracias igual que ayudaste banda jasjsj
si era una note  si funcionan  en desktop
buscá en la web de tu mother cuál es el driver que te corresponde  seguramente sea realtek  pero nunca está de más 
auricular filtra el audio al mic
duda  compre unos redragon scylla h901 literal si hay algun sonido medio fuerte ya sea adentro del juego musica automaticamente lo escucha la gente con la que estoy hablando en discord  alguno sabe que onda tira alguna solucion 
pasaba  bajale la ganancia el volumen al micro  si te sigue pasando ni la más puta idea 
lo estás enchufando en el panel de adelante atrás 
capaz pueda ser la mezcla estereo de tu pc  paso algo similar con solo deshabilitarla soluciono ese problema  pero es 100  seguro que te funcione porque otros han probado han dicho que cambio nada 
probaste si usándolos en otra pc celu hacen lo mismo 
mira rey  esos auriculares tienen el microfono pegado al auricular cualquier sonido se va escuchar
en el de atrás
ya lo probe cambio nada
mataste entonces jajaja  mi pasaba eso enchufando adelante lo solucione cambiándolo 
que lastima  ojala encuentres la solucion 
problema con el audio
hola que tal  resulta que tengo un problema muy molesto con el audio hace bastante tiempo que todavia puedo solucionar  cada cierto tiempo el audio decide cortarse por unos 2 segundos  puede pasar cada 5 minutos  aveces cada 1 minuto  pero es un problema insoportable  pareciera ser que que mi pc deja de tomar los auris los vuelve tomar  porque aparece la notificacion de realtek como que los reconecte  es jodido porque aparte ocaciona problemas en juegos como metro exodus  ya que esa desconexión conexión da como un  tiron de fps   en todos los juegos  pero en este particularmente lo crashea tengo que cerrarlo volver abrirlo  por un tiempo pude solucionar el tema del audio tenia mas el problema en los juegos  asi que es eso  necesito ayuda porque probe de todo  conecte bien los cables de la mother  reinstale los drivers de sonido todos los de la pc  formatie varias veces  hasta probe fijarme si era un tema del conector donde iban mis auris los empece conectar por el conector usb  funcionan perfecto pero sigo teniendo ese problema  la verdad se que puede ser ser que sea la placa de sonido de mi mother este jodida  desde ya muchas gracias 
yo sacaría la duda poniendo una placa de sonido pcie prestada al menos así gastas al pedo si todavía ocurre el error  con parlantes también te pasa 
puede ser el jack hembra de tu mother que veces hace bien contacto igual  busca la opción en el panel realtek  jack detection  destildala  se como sera en castellano  esto hace que la compu deje de estar atenta que pasa con la entrada
tengo parlantes para conectar mi monitor pero hace un tiempo cuando tenia la tele creo que pasaba lo mismo
pasa que ahora conecte mis auris por usb  los logitech g433 vienen con adaptador usb tambien  sigue pasando lo mismo 
si  ya se  por eso mismo  desactiva lo que te dije te va joder mas
ya lo desactive  pero sigue sin arreglarse  
si usas auris usb ¿porque desactivas la placa del mother desde el bios directamente 
te referis al conector rosa solo  eso porque lo solucionaria si tengo nada conectado ahi  yo tengo el usb de los auris conectados la entrada de la mother porque mi panel frontal esta todo roto jaja
desactiva toda la placa de sonido del mother así jode mas  fijate en el manual del mother donde esta la opción 
problema con el audio   help please 
""
¿sale eso por los parlantes  ¿con los auris pasa  ¿el microfono esta cerrado 
en todos los dispositivos que conecto pasa eso  ya sean auriculares parlantes 
los dispositivos de grabacion los tenes todos cerrados 
sip  igual ahora cambio el sonido ya hace ninguno directamente xd f
problema con jack divisor de audio
buenas gente  hace poco compré unos auriculares nuevos  que se conectan por jack por usb  decidí usar un divisor de audio para poder tener los parlantes los auriculares conectados la vez tener que meter mano seguido  pero al conectarlo  tengo un problema  solo anda un canal de los auriculares  un canal de los parlantes cuando uso el jack  que quiero decir  que el jack hace que todo el audio del lado izq salga por un solo canal de los auriculares  que todo el audio del lado der salga por un solo canal de los parlantes  de esta manera  cuando hago la prueba con el administrador de sonido  suena primero un canal del auricular dsps un canal del parlante  hay alguna manera de configurar esto de forma tal que  clone   copie  el audio saliente  para poder tener dos veces el mismo audio como corresponde  es decir  que suene el canal izq en mi parlante izq mi auricular izq  que suene el canal der en mi parlante der mi auricular der   si fui demasiado claro con la explicación diganme para aclarar  pero es una cosa boluda que vuelve loco seguro es una huevada de arreglar   comento otra cosa  mi driver de sonido  hasta donde yo sé  es realtek hd  msi  muchisimas gracias   
compraste un divisor de canales busca en ml splitter auricular divisor 35 pero que en algun lado diga  compartir musica  algo por el estilo
si  tenes forma de hacer que el audio salga por ambos  pero creo que es lo que necesitas  que tipo de divisor compraste  se hace que es el correcto  compraste un separador de canales 
veo que soy un pajero ajajja era uno que habia por ahi en casa  voy tener que comprar otro entonces  gracias 
como dije arriba  soy un pajero ajajja era uno que estaba ahi en casa  voy tener que comprar otro entonces  gracias 
problema audio
hola gente  la verdad vengo con bastante intriga es la primera vez que pasa  acabo de armar una pc pero audio de la placa madre  solo sale el nvdia output audio que es la salida hdmi  tengo los drivers actualizados todo  pero logro que la mother tenga habilitado eso  alguna idea que puede ser  para todas las pc siempre venía habilitado por eso se hace raro ni el panel frontal ni el trasero andan
algunas mothers tienen los drivers del audio separado de los drivers de la placa  en la pagina de tu mother tenes drivers extras algo asi  por ejemplo la mia si vas drivers tenes una pestaña que dice  board audio drivers  que esta separada de los drivers comunes
tenes habilitado el audio desde el bios 
tenes que tocar el icono del parlante al lado de la hora arriba del volumen elegis por donde queres que salga el audio si por el hdmi por la salida de parlantes  win10 
si  pero ya los instale jajaja
todo el protocolo normal ya lo tengo hecho se qué puede ser
 ya hice todo  verecdito final la placa de sonido de la mother vino muerta jajaj
jack para audio mother
tengo una duda  se pueden conectar parlantes la vez aurículares por la salida de la mother  con algun adaptador algo  lo que pasa es que cuando conecto ya sea los auris los parlantes en el panel frontal del gabinete se escucha como el reverendo ogt muchas gracias
si  conectas con un conector de audio  que es un macho dos hembras  lo que podés hacer es tener dos salidas diferentes de esta forma

puedo compartir audio en discord 
buenas noches  quería saber si alguno tiene el mismo problema  puedo compartir pantalla en discord perfectamente  pero el audio se escucha  sale el siguiente mensaje   es posible que ya puedas compartir el audio en tu versión de windows  actualiza al nuevo windows 10   cuando voy buscar actualizaciones de windows hay ninguna más reciente  ninguno de mis amigos les pasa en internet vi nada sobre esto 
si compartía el escritorio comparte el audio  pero si pones por ejemplo solo compartir la pestaña de un juego ahí si se escucha

necesito ayuda con el audio de mi pc
hace poco llegó esta pc  es mi primera computadora de escritorio  tiene windows 10 la cosa es que quiero llamar por discord un amigo  pero cuando conecto los auriculares  son esos samsung que te vienen con el celular  que traen un micrófono   sale un cartel en el lado de las notificaciones preguntando qué dispositivo conecté  auricular  micrófono  entrada de línea salida de altavoz  pongo en auricular  pero solo deja oír audio  usar el micro  pasa con cualquier aplicación  incluido los chats de voz de los juegos  agradezco de antemano cualquier ayuda que puedan ofrecer 
eso es porque los auriculares con micrófono que vienen con el celular traen los auriculares el micrófono en un conector plug 35 tu pc trae un conector para micrófono otro para los auriculares por separado  lo que podes hacer es conseguirte un cable que es algo así  https  wwwwmaccomarimagecachecatalogcableadaptadorsplitterplug500x500png entonces conectas los auriculares con micrófono del celular ahí  los dos conectores de colores los conectas la pc así tendría que funcionar
