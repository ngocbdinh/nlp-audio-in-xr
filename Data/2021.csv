looks fantastic  definitely following project  small sidenote  personally fan enemy detection system gaming  easily exploitable  prefer instant aggression breach line sight  thats  might wan na gather opinions larger group  even huge deal cuz dishonored uses one favorite games 
guys working title  know google later remember back 
looks super promising  steam page yet 
mad potential boy
looks great would rather able freely move
looks interesting  locomotion solely via grapple points  like teleport  tool disposal  either way looks great  gives strong styx vibes 
recommend changing square signals grapple something else  maybe something little less bulky  could sparkles sly make bright enough see easily 
grappling sound gets bit overused  maybe multiple sounds make seem less repetitive 
nt see either re certainly  collectatons 
yep

choice way expensive headset decent visual upgrade without wireless need 500 bucks worth accessories even make work  even overexpensive standalone probably shitty tracking software  enterprise pro means expensive shit guess 
find specs ok price headset  great upgrade reverb g2 index users 
thank god steamvr tracking  high end vr hmd without steamvr tracking would complete waste  imagine spending  1000 system still unable move hands freely  full body tracking  disappointing eye tracking included  maybe addon  wireless addon like htc headsets  improvements resolution fov seem incremental  120 hz significant improvement  may viable hmd option expert beat saber  price  well  htc  expect 
like  ca nt get modest upgrade og headsets actually affordable  market thing besides enterprise  nt enterprise enough options point  thing appeal 10 people enthusiast community nt already bought index  sub  500 pcvr headsets  nt want spend     resolutions refresh rates chance hitting anyway 
costs several limbs  want good non facebook vr  sigh 
earth vive pro 2 really  s market 
resolution per eye  2400  2400  s slightly higher g2
pimax math
cost massive nothing else bundled  wonder testing waters  leak  adjust final price s officially released  s hard see many people fork  1k hmd without even necessary devices run  base stationscontrollers  
fucking lame  dude  even fuck thinking recent twitter hints  slight increase stuff already could get  fuck 
nt consumer  htc moving s vr enterprisebusiness  hence re expensive  want vr mainstay business  architecture engineering etc 
sony s  leak  yesterday completely trashed htc headsets  hilarious
vr spinning ‚Äô wheels time thriving  price ‚Äô  companies need eat cost earn back end like traditional consoles 
like resolution  basically makes hp reverb dead point would liked kind eye tracking something new regard

swapped colors  genius design move 
waste  people htc completely disconnected consumers 
 lcd interested
never seen someone drop ball hard life  brother orchidopexy
looks like m getting  1700 standalone
damn  least hoping foveated rendering  need tech decreases system requirements  guys 
good luck trying run halfdecent looking game full resolution refresh rate even 3090 foveated rendering really around corner  big mistake wait little longer tech available releasing headset  hard believe psvr 2 foveated rendering affordable though  m little suspicious 
hmmm  depends controllers included tax included price 800 might pull  wireless would made easier decision though  might go quest  damned hard call go 2 3 times price wireless 
s new image vive focus 3   https  iimgurcomgd9ie60png   https  iimgurcomgd9ie60png 
lol true

damn s expensive 
anyone  50 discount code yet 
well  think m gon na go proxy service getting valve index 
could get pimax 8kx price  5k ‚Äô care anyone says fov refresh rate worth ‚Äô mind software super polished 
valve ca nt come 60ghz adapter time  m gon na get use wigig 
 next level  meant kind bank account needed one right 
dissapointing  oled  wireless supports 90hz  well least added 120hz support  really notable thing resolution  comparing index  
vive  vive never changes 
controllers  dead arrival lmao  wtf thinking allowing terrible wands continue pro  pro 2  sooooo dumb
leaks  fov horizontal  really nice upgrade edges per eye vision  love  good resolution  ve always good comfort auido  great hmd  issue damn price  sell cosmos elite basestations controllers around 800 make grand bundle d kill index market  s obvious miss really pisses  nt things already  re looking  15001800  especially want wireless adapter  come 
seems like letdown  driving kind resolution without eye tracking foveated rendering going tough  reverb g2 omnicept know next psvr foveated rendering well  90hz maximum via wireless adapter bought separately huge drawback  especially re index owner enjoying 144hz  gap 90hz 144hz vr massive  lcd  rip anyone hoping oled  looks like audio solution first vive pro  hoping d pull hp use audio solution index uses  ear audio fantastic  overall looks like letdown consumers enterprise  m sure anyone got hopes 
might work alternative index headset supports wireless adapter 
 resolution  4896 x 2448 think mistake release hmd high res gpu shortage
weird resolution  ca nt find panel  perhaps re using single display splitting different ipd zones like quest2 
specs actually quite  quite good  s fact re releasing price hmd  bundle  makes joke 
120 horizontal fov  reliable source confirm  m gon na guess s really diagonal  since vive nt specify specs page 
will support display stream compression help edit  s works silly goose   https  wwwroadtovrcomhtcvivepro2specspricereleasedateannouncement   https  wwwroadtovrcomhtcvivepro2specspricereleasedateannouncement

 nvidia drivers ‚Äô suck 
take usd pricing grain salt  converted 800 eur usd blindly  s official price us consumers
gives fuck facial tracking vr chat users  give oled eye tracking 
would think would build wireless receiver headset sell pcie card  think adding backwards compatibilty current one stop gap wigig 2 releases make new adapter  tracking dumb  remove something previous generation headset 
s yesterday  check pico neo 3  quest 2 made fb 
least rumors ll able use quest future without facebook account 
want tesla model 3 tesla want child dna child want last us part 2 naughty dogs quest 2 100  facebook dna
decagear
nt think consumer headset  think commercial  ve given consumer 
100  consumer headset  watch full vive con video talk business  enterprise  healthcare  military  ect  whole lot  nothing consumers 
lcd literally listed spec sheet 
lcd much better vr super low res oled screens
nt forget computer least 3090 cost another 3 grand 
days quest 2 primary sub 500 pc vr  even happens standalone 
120fov horizontal  rumored  actually bad deal 
whales 
people already controllers trackers lol
d guess professional market  engineering  architecture  training 
pixel density probably  fov listed 120 degrees  would higher 
s also seems wireless adapter available  though 90hz  hmm  might m probably going update mixed vr 
s substantial headset  also less sde g2 
s actually like almost quarter pixels  46 million vs almost 6 million  s actually pretty substantial difference  look res like nt seem significant total number pixels math makes big difference 
literally ca nt even play g2 max lower settings time  make headset much resolution  gpu push 
exactly would htc eat cost like sony  still survive  htc nt really store get royalties vr game sales 
hp reverb g2 12 price  nt really see dead 
d say g2s appeal base stations  plug play  specifically simming flight  eye tracking dead meme  kind technology required getting low latency required foveated rendering work theoretical possible  major limitation foveated rendering vr need low latency eyetrackers absolute positioning  electrooculography fast offers relative positioning  ca nt exactly precise electrode placement consumer setting   cameras optical tracking sufficient precision latency currently cost consumer hmd  need entire loop captureprocessrender eye complete saccade  re bringing available latencies milliseconds microseconds  compensate making foveal  region larger allow prediction variance  lose gained render efficiency overhead multiple renders per eye 
looks like expensive way upgrade visual experience index user  hmm  m sold especially means dropping index sound solution  looking forward reviews though since nt look bad 
ve known 4 years  yes 
exactly  still og vive  reason crisp led colors deep blacks  perfect tracking  
 one job  htc  s hope us oled vr fans anymore  ca nt see index 2 anything lcd  hope would samsung made another odyssey headset maybe knows ll ever happen 
fun shitty google daydream andriod apps 
running right  look like good device consumers 
controllers included  get lighthouse tracked controllers market  either vive wands index controller  s worth  screenshot still shows vive wands 
90120 hz  90hz supported via vive wireless adapter  technical specs least work current cuteness adapter 
adjustable
 could get     5k super    price  pro 2 compete 5k super index  nt see many people going pimax extra 30 degrees fov 395  lower resolution 
re using trackpadonly controllers  thumbstick  s everybody colluding ensure oculus true player consumer market  two years index peep valve wireless solution coming point time  controllers hmd cable break time  personally many rmas index  single rma og vive   expect ll oculus decagear come first highdefinition pcvr wireless solution using 80211ay  htc wireless adapter  og vive  seriously doubt performance good much higher bandwidth demanding vive pro 2 
ca nt wireless wireless tech nt exist  s reason pimax dragging feet 
 use lower resolution gpu weak 
 use resolution apps nt demanding weaker gpu 
identical form factor  wifi  eye tracking  face tracking  fov 120 s left  5k lcd 120hz   next level vr  small upgrade 
agree  120fov horizontal would insane  putting like 15 degrees wider index  however  vrcompare also lists fov original pro 124 degrees  would put pro 2 lower fov  although cant find mention 124 degrees pro outside vrcompare  everywhere else puts original pro 110 degrees  guess  bet s 124 6mm slim vrcover 
 dsc reduce rendering costs  dsc reduces cable bandwidth requirements 
nt think think  seems like implemented dp cable actually support massive bandwidth headset needs push  nt seem like going help performance anything 
kinda defeats purpose spending much image quality games run max res beat saber superhot  would feasible hmd lower refresh rates available  like 72hz good sweet spot 
re taking barrel distortion account
starvr one
wireless reciever gets pretty hot actually  inside headset would make unbearable  adding small amount users actually wireless adapter building chip headset directly would nt financially viable  also seeing long took 1st gen wigig become sort actual viable product  really would nt bet 2nd gen anytime soon either  eyetracking expensive model  vive pro eye   also s sku 
instead made china  depends want data end 
ca nt buy outside china  
okay want wireless headset ‚Äô made facebook
waaat‚Ä¶
nice see pewdiepie  good see ‚Äô still dropping ridiculous statements loads negative karma 
‚Äô ‚Äô hoping  ‚Äô believe headset see though lol
decagear still requires pc  though re saying cloud support come future   least s option people good gaming pc want wireless nt want shell insane cash vive pro 2 wireless attachment 
agreed  oculus  coming someone owns og vive  wireless index  
vive pro 2 consumers  basically built enterprise standalone said hey looks pretty cool lets use screen vive pro call vive pro 2 
yeah nt see link glance saw tab clicked  m still going bring leaks  proves reliable leaker 
rgb stripe way better pentile 
s trade  nt  like get better visual quality sacrifice richer colors blacks 
highresolution rgb stripe oled  s like s impossible 
yep  months ll probably primary pc vr hmd period  competing facebook price suicidal  standalone market clearly mass adoption going 
whales though  simmers usual vr whales  wo nt use none games run well enough  reverb already pushes games limit 3090 like  shit dcs ca nt even get past 40fps g2 3090  i9
d rather use g2  excellent comfort audio  guess s people already owned basestations controllers  lot roomscale  would kind imply d already index  people ca nt buy index 
wireless built point 
agree  really wants make argument  looking valve 
live  g2 82  price 
still worth
literally psvr 2 announced foveated rendering headset 
foveated rendering completely viable current tech even works great older vive pro eye  actually tried 
yep  sucks current consumer pc tech ca nt drive better visuals hmds produce  ll settle index level visuals  need pc wireless solution  ve never happy movement limitations imposed tethered  anybody enjoys multiplayer games like popone pavlov understand   s going first  valve  decagear  oculus 
 d say g2s appeal base stations  plug play  specifically simming flight  yep  use mine simracing  s great roomscale mediocre controllers  s incredible sitting rig s stuffed corner poor los og vive basestations 
bro re justifying upgrading  index anything point blows og vive water  upgraded index cv1 night day  forget colorsblacks pretty quickly forget comparison 
og vive looking upgrade  newer headsets perfect tracking 
got ta love sub downvoting us prefer different display technology  love reddit
controllers lighthouses included  joke  utterly irrelevant price headset 
price  bumped thousand  included adapter along controllers basestations  s brainer  already offer  minus wireless  cosmos elite around 800 bump grand call day  s stupid actually really nice headset nice fov bump 
handle weirdos like ipd 79  edit  turns  57mm 72mm  another post

possible 60ghz wireless  someone actually needs   though 
 ca nt wireless wireless tech nt exist  quest 2 120hz wifi  nt quest 2 anymore  even playing pcvr wirelessly launch 72hz great  issues completed halflife  alyx quest 2 wirelessly  think many people  like  hoping wifi 6e  expecting 80211ac minimum   1400  s lot reasons nt capable wireless gaming   1400 headset nt need  350 wireless adapter  90hz  s three years old looks like re wearing wireless router head 
issue wigig2  supposed released years ago kept getting delayed  started getting approvals  last update  revcom sasb approval  2021 february  whatever means   hope  although point  valve would better integrating eyetracking index2  although d like wireless module  sense getting 4k higher hmd  driving demanding even currentgen cards 
s actually pretty hilarious much depend htc blow  haha  fov 120 really nice  since s supposed horizontal diagonal  ends measuring true  s pretty big upgrade 
 next level   ll require  next level  gpu even run resolution  without foveated rendering 
wifi terrible vr  literally everyone vr engineering community least agrees  eye tracking pointless never work foveated rendering  face tracking gimmick one needs game supports vrchat nolifes 
oh duh  thought longer 2 seconds
s biggest reason ca nt believe htc released joke  hate pimax software tad janky truly blow htc water 
main game population one  push 300  resolution 144hz 3080 game  120hz  wider fov  much better resolving distanceresolution sound absolutely amazing  worth  1000 resolution alone  desktop viewing  media consumption 
nt higher res screen still reduce sde even re rendering res 
 starvr one yet commercially available 
d rather one collected data  better fb china 
s chinese market  however read chinese  somehow get working without understand chinese   s worth order china since work wireless tether right box  need registration  also run android apk  mobile gaming  
sooner later  think apple nintendo enter market  sony already  s nt understand buy steam vr  future proof   single one companies use steam vr 
 facebook  company oculus dissolved ceo left  back 2018 s facebook technologies  brandplatform name 
agree  pentile trash
oled display black good  also burn  bad  time pentile matrix used  means save lot lyingchange definition pixel  leading   resulotion specs actual 3366  lower effective resolution  pentile also mean lot distance subpixel know screen door effect  lcd nt see triangular matrix maybe even horizontal lines much smaller gap pentile  sum benefits oled black levels  theoretical  practical lower latency   terms resolution  sde  fidelity  clarity  price  performance  hz  things lcd would better  yeah  pentile oled would total downgrade imo  ava lcd panel gives blacks fidelity need without need oled
super expensive  yes would change mind  nt expect see hmd till 2030
vrchat whales  im one em  ll say right 
d say s decent upgrade index  index 15  sell index money back  hugely better res  along wider fov  probably two important parts vr  tracking controllers  
comparing price vive pro 2 headset alone  headset controllerstracking 
s leak  nt say s paired eye tracking  original psvr use foveated rendering games og ps4 keep fps  s fixed center view 
hear ya  point comment tho  htc really needed incorporate higher resolutionrefresh compel folks buy  especially m htc customer trying stay htc   heck  even looks like og vive fused pro  needed adaptive  haptic finger detecting controllers  eye tracking  wireless  etc  new baseline features upcoming vr headsets 
lighthouse ones  camera based ones  especially reverb g2  good 
 got ta love sub downvoting us prefer different display technology  love reddit yeah  nt come sub often guess s somehow worse oculus ones comes voting  nt really care though  m going state opinion either way  ve owned many headsets  lcd oled still use cv1 rift  guess ll stick years 
yep  d released price bundle  would one best market  hmd  s dead arrival  mean  come  sacrifice little cost get market foothold 
store link literally says  hmd  
wireless adapter somewhat niche product everyone able use  high cpu requirement  pcie slot  distance transmitter   nt think forcing wireless bundle increasing already high price tag would right call  anything  offered heavily discounted wireless adapter w every vp2 purchase 
person horse 
yes  know pain  even 72mm ipd hard time lots vr hmd 
32 degrees difference diagonal  vp2 s advertised 120¬∞ horizontal  conflicting information whether s horizontal diagonal  s looking horizontal   s 150¬∞ diagonal
vive pro nt  1400 though  m disappointed lack 6e well though  6 fine one headset  need roll a lot one space need extra 6ghz channels   stands s still 6e hmd 
yeah  foveated rendering main thing hoping  g2 brings rig knees times ca nt really get excited higher resolution without  m going wait generation two headsets andor cpugpu upgrades point 
takeaway  800 headset ca nt foveate better optimization  stunted graphics card market   fuck 
s terrible many people using 
s airlink virtual desktop popular latency almost undisguisable compared link cable 
 eye tracking pointless never work foveated rendering   sure bud    https  uploadvrcompsvrplaystation4keye 
vive pro 2 way heavy uncomfortable serious media consumption 
yeah  imo re rendering low resolution  re gaining much older headset  g2 50  res  4200x2100  nt look much better rifts aside sde would unhappy purchase stuck running 50    70  feel like starts significant difference 
know plenty people bought one 
disagree  buy chinaphones specifically china ca nt read data  since s english   galaxy brain play 
mean  china get data ways

psvr cheap rbg stripe oled five years ago  nt see would nt possible produce cheap highresolution rgb stripe oled screens today 
 nt mean anything  index literally finger tracking  upgrade  lower steamvr resolution insane amount reverb g2  s way someones using headset max res  controllers ass  finger tracking  honestly would anyone want index  vrchat already pushes low graphics resolution barely matters  o slightly worse g2 visuals game 
headset alone  already base stations controllers  comparing upgrade cost 
s big problem  s incentive sell loss  facebook oculus store data collection  steam steam store profit  s htc making money apart selling hardware

unfortunately  foveated rendering complex  ca nt slap eyetracking magically revolutionize industry  need direct hardware adoption whether s via headset inserts  need able power without subtracting headset  need gpu interface rendering  meaning stable  widespread graphics drivers   need development engines  unity  unreal  lumberyard  etc   implement  lastly  need developers actually adopt  lot complex parts  sets pipeline first  
still rumor  commercial headset might feature set supposed dev kit 
 yeah guys  trust  unreleased headset found today uncomfortable hmd ve ever used   pro 2 shares weight original pro  s going 32  lighter index 
 vive pro compare index comparing g2 
yeah nt sound like really gaming 
sure would possible far exception
already index controllers  yeah s reason upgrade  also m sure often play vrchat  avatars community made  reason would lower fidelity made like 
kind refuse believe could nt get manufacturing costs point could sell headset  basestations controllers least  thousand dollars make profit  ca nt  need new manufacturing contracts  said also problem  ve never chosen invest firstparty software

skyrim vr  mod   https  wwwnexusmodscomskyrimspecialeditionmods1897 
ca nt think top head  vr games sort thing generally nt designed use case mind  nt really trying make natural soundscape interestingnovel ones  google made demo audio sdk awhile back  take look  audio factory   https  storesteampoweredcomapp722590audiofactory  maybe something  otherwise maybe try find something using valve s  steam audio   https  valvesoftwaregithubiosteamaudio   could nt find anything uses current version steam audio find  older demo   https  steamcommunitycomapp596420discussions01730963192548562448   m sure hla uses form well hla nt going realism way might struggle find audio sources respond way 
know mean  honestly ve yet come across game audio functions believable exactly like real life  sure  vr games 3d audio  s still something missing 
notes blindness vr experience focused almost solely sound
audio  eagle flight pretty fun  steer eagle tilting head  s older game  s also usually sale like  5  really enjoy  super chill fly around city 
unless audio uses raytracing  experiments done studios   specific sound amplification  basically games sound sources objects world space 
games positional audio pretty much
least oculus  spatial audio mandatory developer guidelines developer wanting game accepted store
good  ‚Äô want sleep tonight anyways
vertical audio changes depending tilt usually present vr games 
reason nt see many games cutting edge audio companies made nt maintain sdks actively  ve found lot cutting edge audio stuff really buggy supported well  tried implementing steam audio game absolutely tanked performance buggy creating tons sound artifacts  oculus makes good 3d audio specialization software performant  even cutting edge audio propagation using 3d world model audio buggy  s beta  almost 5 years sign life 
spacial audiovirtual surround sound pretty typical vr games s re looking  game nt need made specifically  audio changes based head tilt   unless re looking game emphasizes  example  muting audio nt  aimed  
definitely  one recognize one mentioned always get scared something behind real life hear sounds creeping üòÇ ‚Äô got rift  sure makes difference
know many traditional monitor games problems vertical audio buildings example different levels building part sound  bubble   s good hear many vr devs pay attention aspect immersion 
given strong emphasis good audio vr  obvious difference makes  old fashioned pannedstereo  like describe  getting quite rare  vr games support proper 3d audio  many use fancy hrtf well  steam pushed hard hear difference half life alyx 
see realistic audio engines gaming 
right  semibuzzword might  proximity voice chat   audio levels others speaking turns linear volume knob based far away  take vrchat example  case realistic audio even important demanding immersion vr comes  hear someone talking 20 meters away  sounds like might well next  talk behind wall  might well next  audio distortion  environments affecting air vibrations  taking account realworld physics  things ll eventually need see  might seem like priority right  think 
altspacevr mediocre job cutting highs voices blocked walls  distance falloff curves seem way slowshallow tech already exists  problem adjusting large number streams cpu expensive 
think lot casual players dont care audio calculating audio way describe would lot ressource intensive devs wont invest much time  think juggle graphics port game quest imagine isnt much headroom vr games things like 
spatial audio nt readily baked unreal unity engine thus studios skip instead getting licenses developing one themself  tech almost 20 years already 
sure mean  oculus sdk already supports spatial audio including hrtf environmental modeling  https  developeroculuscomresourcesaudiointrospatialization https  developeroculuscomresourcesaudiointroenvmodeling
think top priority headsets shipping garbage audio ‚Äô surprised ‚Äô  hate ‚Äô sound hear one ear  ‚Äô works 
ca nt even make decent graphics asking realistic audio bit rich
https  valvesoftwaregithubiosteamaudio
graphics made 3d game engines  audio like photos people stretch squeeze photoshop  thing audio ca nt take pen draw wave form sound want make graphics know exactly everything looks like  difference audio requires time axis work  images  therefore ca nt really procedurally generate audio  best snapshot  recording  manipulate  ultimately every time punch wall game sound file played  instead devs best make audio sound like s next  behind etc  ultimately nt know enough sound engineering right  s 71 sound setups exist  even though 2 ear drums  suck making sound artificially sound like s coming somewhere else  cinemas recreate sound sub via headphones  s going come games 
try game forewarned great audio
‚Äô ray traced audio 
seems less like one things people  care  qualityoflife thing makes experience better without player even realising 
nt unreal engine 5 effects least 
correct way delay sound side head  include bit reverb simulate head shadowing  means generating two different audio streams per source  6 people s 12 streams  really spatialized vr want use hrtfs convolve sound based various complex frequencyfiltering effects built ear  basically many streams correctly spatialized would could handle quest wanted get really well done  s market highly accurate audio games  worked something like college pretty cool

well sucks recently getting vrchat talk lot people constanly tell use voice changer shit 
know right
rift  found people pavlov literally fleeing feedback dumping proximity voice chat   unplugging headset rebooting everything always fixed though  s persistent least s mic switch external one 
try rebooting  external mic question mics cable short use vr plus headset doesnt fit vr  earbuds 
gave try rebooting  still buzzing less often 
ve recently playing open world vr rpg hand tracking  full body  clever motion controls  interactive physics  beautiful graphics  immersive player voice control  amazing environmental sound design 
heavily modded version skyrim daaaaamn need games features  put together feels like proper modern 2021 vr game  games need controls interactive systems built ground vr rest traditional game design works great  devs nt reinvent series cut vr experiences  looking doom vfr  heavily compromise gameplay make work  put time making vr variants interaction controls 
modded skyrim vr best 
got ta keep expectations check  even fully modded skyrim still quite blurry flickers compared vr games 
nt pity ten years old pancake game  hastily ported vr modded perfection enthusiasts one best  best  open world experiences vr 2021 
good  decent time playing enjoying views mostly  added dragonborn speaks naturally  mod immediately blown away  m truly immersed  going shop asking sale saying thanks bye go work game stuff truly next gen virtual reality experience 
flicker shimmer  maybe due skyvraaan one many texture replacements  one flat 3d object mods m running dyndolod something   also eliminated blur using fsr mod running 100  resolution scaling dynamic resolution disabled game  run headset 120hz though game generally gets 65100 fps m reprojecting time   game quite sharp great viewing distances    https  steamuserimagesaakamaihdnetugc169615404866316616475fb755a9e65089720a568e8ada32c2dc224e664  imw5000  imh5000  imafit  impolicyletterbox  imcolor  23000000  letterboxfalse  obviously nt look good sharp hl alyx thats linear game tightly controlled views maps  compromise always made large open world games 
reverb g2 similar res headset skyrimvr looks really great  see twice far distance clarity compared say rift  first gen wmr headset  quest 2 aware compression butchers image quality quite bit  skyrimvr probably one worst outliers regard  playing enderal vr wabbajack list atm get shimmer blur  see close screenshots take game look 
feel like weird hell honest  aaa devs seem scared vr baffles  re goddamn lucky got even lazy hasty port skyrim  ports like borderlands 2 nt even good  ca nt fixed  theres exclusive vr titles aaa companies make plainly show ve never played vr game idea make 
hear argument fans skyrim  s game fuckin riddled bugs  lot gamebreaking  story barebones overall direction  minute minute gameplay outdated release boring  m sure look thing nostalgia goggles already love setting s best thing world 
specifically skyrim theres nothing m using airlink due compression  games look perfect 
real  spent multiple hours setting mods shit skyrim vr  hell  everything janky f  ck  got sick actually playing 20 minutes  melee combat felt bad  shooting bow felt bad  nt even try magic  looking back think playing mage would badass since use hands cast spells miserable experience together  suggest something feels like actually world play  boneworks  imo best vr game right 
increase bitrate much  people reported better performance using airlink  open composite bypasses steam vr  although may break mods  100  sure enderal vr mod list achieves sharpness lack shimmer  believe uses taa  remove shimmer  also cas sharpening filter afterwards  look contrast adaptive sharpener enb skyrim nexus  might worth experimenting see get good results  far compression goes  works looking groups pixels similar colour saying represented one colour value  instead recording similar colour values individual pixel  something like traffic sign work really well  need transmit colours  white   red  instead individual pixel  unfortunately skyrim textures lot internal variability  end losing information image looks blurrier  personal preference  many people issues enjoying skyrimvr quest 2 
ve tried cas vrvision  sharp  flickering  flickering  blurry  havent tried manually change bitrate max airlink though  heard make things worse  ill give shot tho  thanks info

detect lag relatively average denon avrx3700h  less  fact  bluetooth headphones

mic may needed m sure  know  select virtual room point like  area front right speaker  one rear left etc  etc   game fixed directions  distance factor step think  nt know hope find something 
no  sorry desktop games running much higher refresh rates produce perfect surround sound without issue regardless fast spin character around plus vr setup knows monitor surround speakers set match screen everything already there for example  screen behind  std steam set  s obvious would rear left front right etc  s normal center speaker would virtual speaker using rear speakers
‚Äô pretty happy minus hdmi 21 chipset bug  go pc   lg cx   x3700h  however  ‚Äô outstanding feature rich receiver drives speakers uncomfortable volume push 
s spin around hard  s move  stereo would recalibrate every time move  spin easy

understanding  devs lazy  surround mode done vr actually  mean possible  hilarious game industry achieving true atmos support days vr game devs still sit stereo  funny  really forcing users play age old stereo nt want extra job  game  want try 
s devs lazy  probably one asked feature  implemented mine using av receiver got annoyed  someone asked  s niche feature already niche market  s better focus important things first  aaa typically atmos stuff  requires licensing dolby  even fewer people proper atmos setup 51 game disassembly vr steam  try  turn speaker mode settings  devs reading  add lines enable surround unity  handling orientation involved  players least get surround sound facing forwards  real surround beats fake headphones surround   audioconfiguration audioconfig  audiosettingsgetconfiguration    audioconfigspeakermode  audiosettingsdrivercapabilities  audiosettingsreset  audioconfig

vr  surround sound
anyone know development instances surround sound  51  71  implemented take account turning etc   experience  nt work system   laptop tv hdmi  51 though toslink receiver 
surround sound vr naturally handled effectively better sound reproduction using actual stereo headphones ones included vr headset  human ears stereo whatnot capable defining surround sound source natively  unless playing something stationary  like racing game elite dangerous example  would recommend using good set headphones accurate 3d surround sound 
dismissive replies old thread s ridiculous 
vr sound configured run headphones  s 51 surround everyone wearing headphones anyway devs waste time small set set vr players
even could get working  would still limited fact surround sound limited horizontal plane  vr stereo sound  distinguish sound s tilting head  use hmd s builtin audio  use headphones earbuds 
‚Äô sure ‚Äô trying  sound vr surround default ‚Äô change turn  talking flat movies want watch inside vr 
considered  use hacked audio drivers daily basis get true dolby digital sound games  movies even music  nt bothered try vr setup yet  considered trying prologic yet see get turn  theory surround sound work  turning vr like turning character screen keyboard mouse  would want exact speakers every corner room  rear speakers become front speakers sound facing true front speakers  full set could  61 surround would probably perfect type setup
dude  frickin use included speaker headset
feel like people understand question
mean sound nt turning  front sounds come front speakers  turn left  example  sound shift front left rear left acting front speakers  happen
seems consensus   use headphones idiot  lol
front left  headset know front left speakers  ‚Äô going explain clearly 
nt sounds stay  since speakers nt moving  staying still turning joysticks 
surround system  headphones
would remove already decent headphones come good headsets try use 51 anyway  say someone audiophile level 51 systems installed multiple rooms home  s something people  zero interest anyone developing systems unique use 
oh  literal surround speakers  thought meant sound files format  vr headsets designed headphones  ‚Äô know expects wired fixed speakers  surround   ‚Äô afraid ‚Äô going work

anyone else getting vr lobbies people sound like youtuber swaggersouls 
recently started playing vr multiplayer games one thing ve seen least 5 times someone joining similar voice swaggersouls  ve stated likely using voice changer others lobby doubt stated s way  lot people sound like swaggersouls people using voice changers  m curious sounded pretty similar chances person super similar voice someone else almost 0 
‚Äô possible sound similar mic causes  irl example friend sound exactly talking phone  ‚Äô possible people sound similar ‚Äô also possible mic causes sound similar  even without voice changer
idea swaggersouls  possibly generic sounding voice 
 pretty deep monotone voice d think would pretty hard similar voice  also keep mind playing small multiplayer game chances many people sounding like seems slim

looks interesting  cant buy though since dont support headset  
agreed  vr subreddits exclusive valve s offerings exist  shitty attempt get unjustified traffic

even put steam  foresee number refunds people find engage anticonsumer practices hard way

added sound point  click interaction system  guys think 
""
extendo arms   genius   way reconciling interact things far away still making sense incontext 
looks cool  interesting take point click paradigm  repetition likely get annoying  especially nearby interactions  audio setting split music sound effects  would turn sound effects  sound effective conveying idea hand travelling long distance coming back  s favorite part  3 suggestions  turn volume redesign sound lower impact  lower tick rate might effective   nt already  vary sound effect nt one loop forever  andor consider dampening effect nearby interactions 
re super small indie team crazy dream making immersive adventure games vr  help us make vision come true wishlisting secret retropolis steam  https  storesteampoweredcomapp1288420thesecretofretropolis
 m  always  duty  
interaction system smart looks effective  great work  however  sound effect extension put  clickingracheting sound sharp think would grate 10 minutes play  hearing  occasional thing  would totally fine  however  seems core consistent part experience  player going hearing every 510 seconds  re really attached  would least recommend reducing volume  may also effective try lowering pitch sound  lower pitches typically mellow ear  softening attack sound would also help  might heavy compromise initial effect  different point view  nt see sound aligns visuals  sort clicking distinct one physical object interacting another physical object  really anything screen looks like would make sound  arms appear act like springs gears rachets sound suggests  game title  get racheting line retro aesthetic  wanted bring anyway  definitely smaller concern first point 
thats cool  love animation 
way interact things close 
ran battery first time tried type awesome try 3 s please understand several pages first attempt 
s smart use sound design  looks like takes cool idea makes fun  good job fella s
sounds good  really need add hitbox spheres around objects  reason espacially visible grabbing screwdriver
cool   plans quest version 
satisfying  
m thinking promotional posts constant reason subscribed sub

s neat virtual hands  mechanic used  expect die   place way back oculus dk2 days  cool  new particular game   know nt explicitly say new anything  giving credit due  
thanks reversetrio  sure ll ship players setting change audio balance  depends much time ll spending character animation  phase started   anyway re going balance sfxdialoguemusic game  nt done yet   arms stretching would much quiet  lowering tickrate also something ll look  s good idea  tickrate spatial  temporal  ticks occur every x inches arm stretch s  x could tinkered  sure  ll also pass idea varying effect sound designer  sounds helpful  thanks

nt know many vr games audio cue sounds object interaction  yes highlights  audio cues  arm sounds good  clicking bad
go go gadget  upvote  
good points  player going hear sounds time game s super important us satisfying possible  repetitive  ll audio mix game ll make sure lower volume lot  sure  also agree lowering pitch could possibly help well  ll give try  looking something better aligns visuals  anything mind

delightful comment read  re going couple extrahigh motivation weeks studio support get  turn translate directly work game 
wow really flattering comparisons  especially studios behind much bigger actual proper funding  re 3 friends goofing around underground bomb shelter  middle eastern version working garage  guess  
re right  video actually internal test hand sounds  levels actual game put lot effort avoid  pixelhunting  putting small interactables far away player  adding expanded colliders items effective selectable area bigger 
meant ieytd games similar mechanics tend give flimsy explanation telekinesis something similar  extendohands place context satisfying tactile way 
halfdeadkiller  thanks feedback  better worse  game stuff differently vr games  input click based  meaning one click puts objects hand  stays interact parts scene using  release object  either click inventory  give npc  use another item scene  vr gamers  us included  nt used paradigm  found 2 minutes get used  great upsides  1 allows streamlined  stretchy hand  experience  really cool feel vr 2 allows us author rich meaningful stories  much deeper immersive narratives  clicking sfx mainly reflect different ux paradigm re presenting game  said  re willing playtesting without sound  see plays better  
thing comes mind springy slinkylike sound  even though arm set rings helix  look similar  way could still retain excellent pitch change occurs distance  less serrated sound  honestly though  point probably worth prioritizing finding pleasant sound  definitely think finding sound pleasant enjoyable ears take priority physically plausible sound case  also want toss separate idea  comments see really want make mechanic engaging possible  right advantage re utilizing motion controller aiming  means player sort standing pointing around  think fine  believe opportunity offer physical engagement player make use vr even worthwhile  consider requiring optionally enabling ability  throw  extending hand  perhaps  aim  gaze  pull hold trigger lock target  make throwing motion controller  releasing trigger throw start extension  throw nt need done accuracy  hand would always reach lockedin target  imparts initial motion  visually  hand would first inherit velocitydirection throw  time conform correct trajectory reach target  like hl gravity gloves nt much matter pull  object always reaches hand  case throw  think could make mechanic playful  allow players inject personality gameplay  valid concern could become tiring  like gravity gloves  nt need require large motions  flick wrist would good baseball throw  throwing motion mostly flavor  lets player express connect kinetic action seeing game  m sure would simple thing implement  perhaps even requiring whole rewrites  wanted offer thought case  inspiring work nonetheless 
think selection cursor large enough 
 3  
explained  strong electromagnets  never seen game 
think sound effect clicking probably alright  rewatched video think part nt fond click mousing object 
like suggestion lot  bunch ideas make core mechanoc richer deeper  make better use spatial tracking controller  pretty similar ve suggested  must admit really liked properties suggested throw   tbh ideas would probably implemented dlc anor hopefully sequel  reason ve committed summer 2021 release  want finish character animation  meantime re looking maximize fun refinments already playtested  finding satisfying stretch sound world  
think bills small far aim conveniently  s test environment used test sound  game levels playtest thoroughly make sure s never punishing find grab objects  ll playtesting game comes summer  d cool could play well let us know felt 
watch video 
totally makes sense  production timeline definitely respected  m glad could offer something chew  good luck project going forward  launch summer  solid work far 
yes  s suggested magnets  since s nothing physically holding together s stretched

 take away anything headphone users s problem  properly set spatialized binaural audio  set output 51 71 system  necessity  break binaural audio  implemented middleware  like steam audio  wwise  etc   theoretically  could done decently  less directionality  otherwise  would essentially require every developer support output mode manually work well  would require lot tweaking produce convincing results  nt something steamvr implement  steamvr api communicates headset  valve could support use case  d developers actually make happen  strongly suspect developer support would far niche use case    x200b  end result would  games support proper binaural audio  frankly  vr games  s travesty every time encounter vr game software nt   output would end comparatively flat lifeless  also note    niche use case  basically developer would spend time implement   d bare minimum less 1  target audience would use  could done properly  sure  something requires developers extra work support tiny subset already fairly small audience  s probably going happen time soon    x200b  tl  dr  valve ca nt implement  individual developers would  end result would muddled  flat soundstage ca nt even begin hold candle proper binaural experience    x200b  edit  thought  really want better experience others  bitch valve make pair headphones index bmr drivers  d fix vast majority issues  without sacrificing audio quality binaural sound 
 ever watched friend play vr  either watching person flail audio using headphones  take away experience use speakers audience hear wont useful player  know audio mirror  setting steamvr right 
would nt work well roomscale games stay central ideal listening position  move closer particular speaker sound louder supposed vice versa  last poop incomplete need go soon 
sure implementation details  miss raw immersion proper subwoofer provides 
absolutely agree thing  implementation  ironically  simply surround sound  many flat games already since long ago  vr  games use positionalambisonic engine mix sound based player position view direction   think unity unreal builtin  would nt work physical surround speaker setup  obviously  rather develop another sound engine  suppose gamesound engine makers make option lock listening direction forward  first initialize headset position  go  would work games mostly stand one place  works vr games  actually 
friends vr  moment pick headset sound jumps headset  switch back mouse go volume settings change back normal 51 sound  everybody happy   
yeah  could work  best use case would arrange speakers circle  remain center  vr space pretty small  s play vr games anyway  would also good rotating treadmilltype setups  currently use 51 setup playing pancake games 3d vr  reshade w superdepth3d  helixvision  vorpx  s far superior speakers g2  sense depth space around spectacular  bodythumping base ca nt matched  course  advantage center view  speakers  stays fixed  would think could accomplished easier driver level audio rather steam  realtek s drivers pretty good job  also add codecs dolbydts  etc  d need pull orientation headset steam   rotate  sound center  remix proper channels  would nt surprise pieces put something like together already opensource 
considering sound object based rather location based  please explain  ve read response would really like get re coming   pun intended 
hope come eventually implementation straightforward developers game engines unity  unreal  course source  nt know many vr gamers confused potential benefit  dynamic surround sound replicated solely headphones using software solution 
 effing  one thing miss flat screen gaming true 51 surround  nt care anybody says simulated  binaural  spacial audio stereo signal beat sound coming physically behind  really brings home re sat center playing gta v real vr mod police come screaming behind crash something front  instance works perfectly  re sat one spot  always facing front  start changing direction moving center introduces whole load issues could technically overcome engine constantly compensating pointed would nt worth developer implementing  anyone suggestions modded pancake games surround though  d love try 
use tool force surround sound flatscren games  m sure would nt work vr front player would front speakers
m slightly confused premise  clear nt really care anyone sets stuff  though multiplayer m hearing echo speakers re jerk makes want die  said one suggestions seems bit  people watching play need sound s mirroring option exists  still get normal useful ingame sound addition anyone watching screen get sound whatever speakers happen connected  think issue would see single set surround sound speakers would player getting audio signals appropriate locations  assuming re perfectly centered  viewing screen would aurally place  things like sweaty ears index pretty great audio nt sit ears  d super inclined see headsets go similar solution  index user way ve got headphones set steamvr audio mirroring works none issues ve described exist  obviously vary depending peoples equipment kits nt even built audio idea mirroring works  nt  oculus  anyway originally stated certainly nt care implement thing want  ll impact absolutely reason use nt solve issues  wish luck unfortunately one nt seem like super likely thing implemented base system  could see games kind thing built  especially games re seated moving  project cars  star wars squadrons ect  suspect s fair amount additional work processing needed anything user nt locked place currently surround sound works 
could post suggestion openvr github page https  githubcomvalvesoftwareopenvrissues think valve would likely see 
im confused  use 51 play vr  change output steamvr audio tab  wanto even two outputs 
gon na sound nuts tracked speakers  least individual locations  created sound emitters virtual locations   take binaural audio  put microphone binaural mix player s head  pipe mix speakers  long player nt turn far virtually always relative movements turns real life  maybe m getting fancy virtual microphones placed speaker s location  piping channel mono audio directly related speaker would work better  hard put words reason 
upvoting relate last part
s also worth noting many surround sound setups satellites smaller dynamic range front channels  re designed assumption sitting fixed position looking fixed direction  turn around rears become fronts everything behind would sound incredibly loud comparison 
output audio multiple output sources  av receiver subwoofer engage volume speakers set

yes   binaural gets directionality correct tell frontback even topdown  however distance nt quite right  sometimes sounds like 12m away even inside head  real surround system replicate properly fuller sound depth  volume immersion  s audiophiles always talk soundstage   also hifi setups cost entire vr setup  s another story  binaural truly better  d sitting movie theatres headphones instead

edit  price  800 usd800 eur headset  full kit  1400 usd releasing july sources leaked polish trailer   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vfymuzaei9ak   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vfymuzaei9ak  site went live little early   https  bestwarecomenhtcvivepro2hmdhtml  utmsourceyoutube  utmmediumbeschreibung  utmcampaignhtcvivepro2launch  utmcontenthtcvivepro2videoen   https  bestwarecomenhtcvivepro2hmdhtml  utmsourceyoutube  utmmediumbeschreibung  utmcampaignhtcvivepro2launch  utmcontenthtcvivepro2videoen 
  800 eur nt know already switched eurodollars   p really case would one nicest conversions  ‚Ç¨ seen  example  index full kit  999 1079‚Ç¨  still far cheap course 
interesting going lcd route  guess really pump 90 hz unless go lcd like index  going oled higher refresh rates expensive margins want  kind wish would stick oled s one big thing vive vive pro  extremely good color reproduction contrast  also price point asking  seriously doubt d willing part index  glad sticking base station tracking  s really much hassle set  tracks 1000x better camera based inside solutions anyways 
christ  s really nice specs doubt  releasing price  bundle  without wireless adapter includedbuilt deal killer  dead arrival  including eye tracking price either  come  also  still new controllers  jesus htc  re buying  base stations  controllers  re looking like  1500  nt going fly 
120 fov horizontal  believe actually generally larger index  new controllers  included eye tracking  included wireless  nt sold bundle  give break  specs unreal chance actually knock one park  blew pricing  released  even without eye tracking   1000 hmd  basestations  controllers  included wireless  would dominate entire pcvr market 
new vive focus 3 image   https  iimgurcomgd9ie60png   https  iimgurcomgd9ie60png 
current vive wireless adapter actually push 5k  120hz  would compressed max 
nt understand  5k  comes vr headsets  compare index 1600x1440 per eye 
flop  pro enterprise device focus consumer competitor quest facebook  least hope improved lenses since cosmos 
wow  s  substantially worse index  exact price 
iirc  vive pro s fov 108ish  s ok bump  shame going lcd  price way high oled 
 lcd screens fuck  want new oled headset  guess ‚Äô get pimax 5k xr
mean  still uses steamvr basestations  s great advantage  need new hardware s best tracking possible right  crappy inside dead spots etc
want oled  oled better high refresh rates better contrast colours  reason see lcd screens way cheaper make  htc excuse  especially price tag 
25k oled 120 degree horizontal fov  would something special hands       would winner  unfortunately  going lcd turns mediocre upgrade  black levels colours likely going pretty shit  m pleasantly suprised 25k resolution   along modest improvement fov  severely dampened lack oled  s wasted opportunity  shame  price  continuing oled  would true differentiator  s really quite close tbh  25k per eye resolution good could hoped  s really missing mark overall  ll probably going ahead g2  lcd headsets s best bet decent black levels colours excellent lenses displays  21k per eye resolution  valve index speakers  light comfortable  half price  want also use lighthouse index controllers  ll eagerly awaiting impressions comparisons  specifically looking contrast  colours  glare  m doubtful 
 deleted 
pretty underwhelming 
eye tracking fail 
oled  welp  guess wo nt buying 
well sucks  vive wireless adapter supports 2448 x 1224 resolution 90hz refresh rate used vive pro 2  3264 x 1632 resolution support coming soon  90hz supported via vive wireless adapter
completely detached  s shame ever opportunity nail  vive pro 2 improved oled screens  build wireless adapter  new controller design  120 fov fine  120hz nt important 90 good enough  headset  599 full kit  999
make mistake buying vive pro eye weeks ago  headsetonly dropin upgrade 
looks heavy  ‚Äô weight  ‚Äô seen posted anywhere

meh  ll keep og vive  updating gpu already headache  wo nt spend money minor headset upgrades  since play elite dangerous  like oled s black 
everyone crying  1000 price incorrect leak actual product  800 peak reddit 
og vive release sold year due lack use  get g2 index htc started tease new headset  prices real ll skip device go back one original choices  justify price beyond 
go lcd  lose one real advantage index  complete disappointment  index audio advantage probably still  probably still better mic  costs lot less  htc sales support advantage actually sell parts  s worth something  also need correct product people buy  yes know valve courtesy replacements people smash controllers five pieces  nt sell parts  nobody catering oled market anymore  samsung busy wasting designs wmr segment  wanted lcd  would bought index  s bad price hmd 
wireless purchase

oled wireless two reason m still sticking vive pro  would nt mind drop another 1000 bucks upgrade want lcd headset could get 3 quest2 price 
still changing design one bit embarrassing something inspire trust profesionalism  fov great doubt 120 fov clean 120 fov without distortions nt really possible increase fov standard 100 fresnel lenses without adding distortions  going get distortions similar pimax  better  1000 whole package  base stations  controller headset   otherwise nobody going buy 
index equivalent fov would nice  although suppose s far  new top dog resolution sweet  ignoring pimax   might get reliable pcvr nt constantly break like index  biggest downside controllers though 
says preorder starts today   take money  would able select different hz 120  90  80 
ca nt find clarification work existing wireless adapter  original vive  10 base stations index controllers wireless adapter seems like could good upgrade path s compatible  though s hard stomach paying 800 headset versus 400 quest 
anyone received promo code signingup newsletter  nothing

‚Äô sure dozen people interested offer 
‚Äô index resolution comparison  4k  vr resolutions ‚Äô translate ‚Äú xk ‚Äù well tvs

psvr uses 120hz oled 
oled nt fill rate small panels  plus s mura black smear issues  Œºled us going s 
completely agree  wasted opportunity  would given 25  50  resolution something like quest 2  oled instead 
lack wireless box  pre order  day 1 vive   index guy 
yeah tried good deal many vr headsets  original vive still wows colour vibrancy
 deleted 
yes nt wireless adapter included use existing wireless adapter  bought wireless adapter along vive pro nt cheap well  another thing consider  competition regarding wireless vr pc  yet   another company would actually announce something regarding wireless vr pc headset  still hoping valve announce one  lower cost  htc would adjust since existing wireless adapter   use 90 hz lower resolution  updated written website   said  think competition wireless vr near future  htc best chance gain followerbuyer 
 also  still new controllers  jesus htc  bit s killing  longer expectation valve launch index controllers country  ve seen enough people issues nt want buy unofficially either case issues  man  really ca nt believe m still stuck vive wands years 
would ideal price  cos thought alright  looks like use existing gear 
whoever made  really thought going sell jack shit  htc bury themself ground 
yeah  wo nt buying  headset  1000  eye tracking  oled displays  really good resolution good hz rate  seems  
m going see specs feel weird  tracking could integrated right  s chance ve building model long ca nt integrate  wireless  htc makes missteps  seems like deliberate shot foot m going hold hope s something wrong leak  nt make sense 
 monster graphics card run res 120hz  add another 2000 
nt seem bad  considering  priorities high resolution steamvr tracked  considering getting hp reverb g2  slightly expensive upgrade  actually steamvr tracked  yes nt come controllers  would nt used g2 controllers anyway  also  would want new controllers  actually really like vive wands  index controllers  ca nt think anything else d want 
 blew pricing  course  s real avenue profit htc  make per unit absolutely matters  valve  oculus  etc  nt care loss per unit much  since revenue stream software  htc hardware company must make money per unit simply nt worth  s business 
also another website states wireless compatible old adapter locks 90hz  also official page   800 hmd 
using new controllers coming vive focus 3    edit  s tracking vive needs update controllers 
index 108 degrees horizontal  confirmation 120 degrees horizontal  looks like  diagonal  therefore diagonal improvement 10 degrees original vive pro  110 horizontal  s improvement index  slightly perceivable difference  price would absolutely fine oled  would truly amazing headset 
except would still include wands 
remember vivepro ve released exactly way  headset headsetecosystem  people bought  included   re repeating  sucks oled though  even lcd s ll still better wmr hp g2 reverb long stretch

90 hz limit
doubt even push 5k  90hz without heavy compression  vive pro 90hz already compresses edges image  doubling resolution going compression city  really hoping d updating wireless module new standard 
product page says ll basically pro 1 resolution 90fps  hope bump like 2k x 1600 per eye 90fps soon  still full resrate edit someone else actual text   vive wireless adapter supports 2448 x 1224 resolution 90hz refresh rate used vive pro 2  3264 x 1632 resolution support coming soon  90hz supported via vive wireless adapter
graphics cards actually render 5k 120hz 
2448x2448 per eye
 deleted 
s worse  exact price 
least htc likely actually ship worldwide
know right   1000 headset non oled display  insanity 
yeah  people see paying premium index people really value good colours  felt market  would least considered  reason nt get index s lcd  every time compare lcds oleds  colour degradation disappointing  colours bring vr life  know people complain fill factor sde  colours make experience 
108 maximum possible fov remove face gasket  102 fov face gasket 
5k xr oled  got even lower pixel density vive pro  sure got really wide fov enough make anything side grade vive pro 
g2 decent amount problemsannoyances  excited finally leave wmr world 
 oled display  even around 3800x2000  around quest 2 resolution  would one preordered right   m going wait see oled headset comes 
quest 2 reverb g2  g2 great headset sweet spot small  q2 small sweet spot  considering  may wait reviews  like fov  sweet spot great would big win 
d personally advise g2  fix fov bit new facial interface  lenses complete trash distracting af  despite great resolution  stand use valve index  mention windows mr environment layer tends jack performance part complete annoyance  also  yes oled used miles ahead lcd black levels color saturation  newer lcd panels miles ahead may used years ago 
ve heard  seen lens videos  g2 natural colour balance  would value saturation  would nt want oled panel anyway every oled ve used smeary blacks hate  really hope panels use pro 2 similar g2  ca nt wait someone put lens vids 
need eye tracking  people keep saying ca nt see supposedly need  eye tracking gon na wan na play games nice graphics 
says compatible vive wireless adapter  90hz  eyetracking price  oled either  passing  surprises 
ok oled  bad  idea vive pro uses cv1 usues  nt really care long looks nice  oled amazing 
honestly think s really great works wireless  think 90hz fine compromise  get resolution supported asap nt count drawback  definitely big plus feature list  honestly nt expect wireless  still missed mark though overall 
massively reduced resolution  even higher resolution support  coming soon  3264 x 1632 instead 4986 √ó 2448 s literally running quarter resolution  lower vive pro 1 
s detached nt able afford  willing  pump billions vr like fb 
totally agree  pricing simply unrealistic lol
could nt agree  oled displays would priced higher though  would okay losing 25  resolution compared  oled displays instead 
yeah main issue price   800 way high opulent enthusiasts   1400 kit pretty much doa imo  better getting index upgrading something higher res future ‚Äô cheaper  personally ‚Äô mind lcd that much  ‚Äô step back  ‚Äô worth better clarity  least vs pentile oled  generally higher refresh rate yes know high refresh oled exists  non included wireless  ‚Äô looking hundred extra  summed way expensive  decent specs  compromises  way expensive 
ah yes  definitely spent r   taken design risks  complicated manufacturing  gone super low profit margins niche lowvolume enthusiast product true competition  bonus points completely obsoleting one current products process  cosmos   s simply alternative specs  nt lasso moon nobody else either 
think would easily justifiable sell price oled  really missed mark 
nt even care wands s compatible index controllers  anyone bothered simply purchase headset lighthouses index controllers separately  turns s actually slightly cheaper well  s nonissue imo  d rather focus resources developing index controller competitor  index controllers going surpassed time soon anyone  resolution much anyone could hoped  literally thing ve done right  needed stick oled  produce maybe 120 degree horizontal fov  price would justified d incredible headset hands  good wireless supporting resolution may even possible right  m salty  oled absolutely possible  s made big mistake  fov disappointing  seems nt even surpass index  s poor effort supposed high end headset 2021 
price makes sense unless s subsidized  pointless vive since using data leverage   s reason every single headsets lot expensive quest 2 hardware expensive  facebook subisidizing probably 50  cost headset   microsoft thing wmr headsets  true cost high end headsets closer  1k mark  vive selling reasonable price  issue product underwhelming outdated  seriously whole excuse redesigning users liked complete bullshit  ve got upgraded vive pro price still profitable  facebook completely dismantled market selling something half costs make money printer runs user data  get completely delusional consumers like  facebook effect vr community worked  nobody accept real price technology anymore  s bittersweet thing  re amazon done many companies selling something loss kill competition 
mean  want eye tracking   since one 
 vive pro eye oled  refuse buy another lcd headset  personally 
also digging weight
s like saying people crying getting stabbed 10 times instead actually 8 s still trash price lcd poor wireless support  90hz  
considering way thing worth  800  ill give outrage pass  expensive regardless something straight worse index 
real 
hey reverb g2 say right factory calibration panellens selection lcd look pretty darn close oled  side side comparison perceptual one playing  m also hesitant preordering pro 2 without lens comparison  one hand g2 amazing clarity colors black levels  games dark environment look pretty amazing displays totally immersive  hand ve got quest 2 relatively high resolution totally ruined subpar lcds panels washed colors horrible black levels  dark grey s   night dark scenes look pretty bad  one pro 2  hard tell without comparison current lcd king g2  looking pimax 8k vtol  whatever s called  makes clear resolution bump really adequate re willing get colors black levels decent level like g2 
s 100  lcd directly contact htc  straight told wo nt buy lol
well gain massive resolution advantage 
resolution pro 2 waaaaaay better index  index looks like m playing 640x480 duke nukem shit  s awful 
gon na push many pixels air though  s unreasonable

oh  guess makes sense  would assume usd price around  800 well  ll see

s nowhere near resolution new displays  would surprised announce psvr 2 also low persistence high resolution lcd display 
normal rgb instead pentile  one arguments used lcd
s horribly ironic people spouting bullshit oleds unable run high refresh rates oleds actually better suited lcds  lg claims tech  decade ago  capable hundreds kilohertz refresh rates

absolutely  dropping oled big mistake  great opportunity really differentiate pack  price  nt want dealing major compromises colours contrast  least match g2 colours black levels  s best lcd headset far near oled cases  worse  s fail price 
unfortunately expected  complete disaster cosmos  d indicated learned lesson   sacrifice little cost put thousand dollar bundle  included wireless adapter  d gain big market foothold space  mean hell  sell cosmos elite bundle like 800 dollars everything included  make grand call day

old argument really  getting resolutions nt issue anymore  old odyssey samsung showed time get low screendor effect  even headset old 
exactly  s way lcds  better   easier  high refresh oled  complete opposite true  lcds nightmare high refresh rates comparison  said  s almost certainly cheaper use lcds still

hateeee vive wands prefer quest controllers immensely  albeit quest controllers arent sturdy  design much intuitive  fact ‚Äô basically saying ‚Äú meh go buy index controllers instead ‚Äù ridiculous
see competition way better price points  mba worth salt look go ‚Äô look good htc
seems like different market segments like pc gamers console gamers  vive targeting premium high end market keep positioned innovation company releases latest gen bells whistles whereas products like rift meant casual experience works gets job done  htc ‚Äô dumb  obviously thought  reason targeting higher tier segment casual  ‚Äô want commodity pricing premium justify r position setting standards next gen expectations 
m actually interested focus 3 wonder play steam games 
know s 120 horizontal  said 120 advertised original vive 110 far know  s diagonal 120  10 degrees diagonal 
 sad thing  s actually great headset spec wise maybe like 2 years ago  s beaten path pimax 5ksuper crushes less 
made new decent controllers  included base stations priced 999 like index  doubt take valve lunch money  cost like 1600 whole package two terrible controllers  nobody going buy 
see quality lcd panels  m betting  good  worse colorcontrast wise cosmos counterparts 
 everything good  oled  good  90hz wireless  good 
   quite pricy  also  add sales tax  europe including  without taxes europe also 640 euro instead 
seeing catching  great logic comment 
actually like vive wands  good object presence  feeling like holding gun  sword  tool  etc   wanted hand presence  would get index controllers  oculus controllers seem like good  best  compromise  would nt prefer either scenario  would liked see use valve s audio solution though 
vary  people s way around  vertical way higher horizontal index  vive pro 2 official fov 120  offical fov vive pro 110  expect maximum 10 degrees fov diagonally  likeliness  definitely wo nt translate 120 degrees horizontal  even close 
yes  g2 claritycolor center lens awesome  everything else including fov step viveproindex  btw  original vivepro fresnel lens total crap  sweet spot tiny due overwhelming god raysglare  ie  focus light shift due refraction negating whole effect 
s anything like switching vive  s quick  re either using wirelessonly wiredonly  hotswapping fly nt work way 
yeah  even foveated rendering  would need absolute beast pc  think priced high focused features 
yep  instant buy  waiting next generation gpus 
nt index 144 still beta ghosting  could nt vive also upgrade headset beta 144 later  also play 144hz 120hz nt suffice  nt need 5k res beat saber arizona sunshine  stick index  true aaa games best graphics never run 144fps 5k res  nt understand hate htc 
cares  resolution blows index water  120hz enough 
yeep  unfortunate thats right aswell  rgb oled 1440x1600 per eye would really good start  xtal 3840x2160 per eye pentile oled neat staying pentile likely nt right direction 
true indeed  would nt mind weird mixed setup came good enough headset  tracking headset cameras controllers lighthouses 
stopped  wasting time  wmr long time ago  barely available 2019 samsung removed product page year ago 
even headset supports  games  provide real performance improvement 
s adapter works  still unresolved compatibility issues adapter certain hardware configurations
good point  maybe compatible  downgrade  real  resolution 
currently boat m  hanging vive pro long possible simply sweet  sweet contrast  90hz enough  fov nt dealbreaker 
although quest  pcvr degrade oled experience video compression 
ugh  situation haha  got great deal quest 2  nice  holy crap blacks pathetic compared og vive  also odyssey believe uses panel vive pro quite nice  trying decide one sell 
ever tried reverb g2  worse tracking controllers really nailed lcd right  s lcd vr panel ve used almost nt miss oled contrast colors  match g2 lcd quality really might good enough 
lcd wo nt suffer burnin loss maximum brightness time  oled screens slowly decay time
g2  bunch hmds  completely agree assessment  s really lcd s ever  close enough  becomes acceptable alternative 
sorry yeah second thoughts disappointment  sure 
fb good comparison  re selling headsets knowledge make money back bc sell intrusive ads based data collect tracking  vr headsets gather massive amounts pii  fb paid 650 million violating illinois biometric data collection laws  really doubt care fine  prolly still made money abusing law fine imposed smartphones  researchers found accelerometer data smartphones reveal people s location  passwords  body features  age  gender  level intoxication  driving style  used reconstruct words spoken next device 
fair facebook subsiding cost based profit made leveraging extraordinary amounts user data  htc still fucked tho par course 
facebook sells door store  299  loss  get spend money games collect every minutia existence target ads censorship 
technology one headsets nt know  helped somehow  sort technology would make places nt looking rendered lower fidelity  nah  things nt exist  even less product years old company  would ridiculous 
oled gives much higher contrast  blacks actually look black  gives depth entire image  lot presence imo  lcd backlight much lower contrast  means blacks actually greyish  re longer standing darkness something like arizona sunshine mines example  re staring grey  really takes experience m constantly reminded m looking low contrast monitor essentially  everything looks flat washed  instance  always want high contrast ratio good black levels tvs  find even important vr  edit  want add lcd bad  especially add mechanisms like local dimming increase contrast televisions  however  vr headsets around 7001 contrast ratio   good  say least  lcd monitor 30001 contrast ratio instance black levels still mediocre compared oled  even s raised slightly pure black reduce black smear   people apparently adapt lcd panels vr  m certainly one 
yeah  without taxes  around 640 euro europe without  like getting really close  1000 us 
nt aware strobing backlight  assume s tech refered black frame insertion  better motion pay loss brightness  close oled comment meaning s close enough nt constantly distracted terrible blacks colors  side side comparison oled still way better daily use g2 good enough s something constantly distracting enjoyment way index quest 2 
nt even received signup confirmation email 
nt received anything yet  either  re boat 
consider successor model hmd already eye tracking variant starts make sense people would expect standard feature new version  especially even highest end rigs still struggle run index higher refresh rates ton games  going bigger without way increase performance seems kind silly  re point vr resolution going hurting experience rather improving ca nt get wide spread adaptive rendering methods 
pc specs  see incremental upgrade seems like good headsets horizon new tech built like eye trackingface tracking 
let know  fov larger small bump res g2  may end pixels per degree reverb g2  dont get wrong thats still really clear may feel like g2 better fov lenses  120hz   windows mr crap 
 deleted 
 ca nt say m surprised  imagine wireless system designed guaranteeing something like 100  og resolution safety factor  wonder ll stability problems higher resolution  hence idea waiting reviews 
full resolution refresh rate  box s lower res vive pro 1 
actually quest 2 also work got  puke  virtual socials  tried wireless cool  headsets wireless obviously plan  fuck 5ghz routers default  d go buy one specifically  suppose nt another headset basestations might want certainly dont  may future current imo  would htc want inside one owns 5ghz routers way costly include device headset 
quest 2 great casual player  wireless obviously awesome certain games like beat saber 360 s cheap enough get one  enthusiasts want  quest poor colors  mediocre ipd adjustment narrows fov goes higher shows edge screen  small fov general  less lighthouse tracking  bad speakers  vive pro 2 higher resolution  higher fov  better ipd adjustment  better tracking  probably better audio  comparing kind difficult  quest 2 unrivaled quality cheap vr added bonus free wireless capability  vive pro 2 aiming expensive  top notch vr expensive addon wireless capability 
m convinced get oled panel high resolutions  low persistence  keep reasonable cost yet  s couple reasons manufacturers going lcd route 
sony made 8k phone display years back iirc  looked like crap though
‚Äô need eye tracking foveated rendering
eye tracking render high resolution looking future reason 
g2 would good idea time really want leap forward resolution  going step oled  general consensus s first lcd headset actually adequate contrastcolour  near oled times  feeling may see oled vr  next display tech might get miniled  supposed oled competitor  s could next vr 
 ‚Äô ones vrgame ‚Äô also making tons software cover loss hp would another example 
use airlink every day quality good link  better rift   nt know heard black bar thing s issue  also quest 2 supports 120hz mobile headset announced nt really matter since gaming headset  honestly side oculus facebook account honestly nt big deal people like get mad
headset getting resolution  fov  refresh rate  tracking  optional wireless capability  yes spend less ll also get less make significant trade  vr enthusiasts  target demographic  nt clear headandshoulders winner price  product seeks provide peerless experience falls short acrosstheboard leap forward losing oled screen  softens blow somewhat 120hz  nt play value game right  even would turn profit much lower price would render cosmos irrelevant overnight  pro 2 nt everyone would foolhardy compete value facebook insideout systems  someone comes along makes equivalent product much lower price point yeah htc problem s theoretical right 
direct competitors respected demographic like sony facebook  targeting different market segment  focused industry leaders sets next gen standards  logic like saying amd stupid releasing next gen gpus new technology 700 dollar serious pc gaming enthusiasts cheaper 150 dollar gpus play counter strike good  think high end pc market leads innovation targets hobbyists want best  versus casuals want simple pc play minecraft
exactly  focus 3 much important news vivecon event  f3 got really good tracking works fine become viable competitor market  surely primarily business wise though 
original vive 110 horizontal  htc one manufacturers accurately advertises fovs  compared facebook instance lie teeth 
specs web site say 120 degrees  say horizontal diagonal  ‚Äô going like index  based shape face close move lenses 
pimax nt matter market s true  look usage percentages steam  re incredibly fiddly hardware  compatibility  etc  point could never enter consumer mainstream  could  arcades  etc 
terrible controllers  using cv1 controllers teh vive wands alright actually  quite like  gon na get knucles read issues folk decided stick wands  would like wands make em bit smaller  thats 
use index controllers  going  want top tier vr got ta pay 
agreed  confident colours black levels good 
‚Äô many hard ons oled around  yes  contrast black levels better  yes  much sde 
well s rendered  physical face structure could affect actually see  hard limits  s worth  able reach limits vive  nt know vive pro s diagonal fov  s roughly 110 horizontal vertical sheet says 
yeah concern lcd suck worse black levelscolour g2  audio step valve speakers  terrible glare  wait impressionscomparisons g2  ca nt sacrifice contrast colour  definitely ca nt dealing glare like index  s g2 level buy  s good front  ll go straight vive pro 2 sure  25k per eye 120 degrees fov horizontal would amazing experience black levelcolour good 
m thinking ll keep pro 1 wireless use pro 2 stationary stuff
dlss 21  dlss already works wonders regular games 
nt aware 144hz beta feature  thought  released   regardless  ve using entire time nt experienced  ghosting   sure  htc could patch 144hz support update  if hardware physically support  seeing htc nt announced anything sort  nt think s worthwhile assumption  whether people would actually use 144hz kind irrelevant discussion comparing specs two products  fact similar price  one slightly lower specs  s really said  nt get wrong  nt mean imply  hate  htc comment  original vive  still use base stations index  m thrilled current offering 
ah  nt pay close enough attention resolution  may skimming
ve released anything  patents still wmr designs  referring  seems still working ecosystem  whether release anything new 
 introducing new layer latency  believe technology tracks adjusts resolution par lightspeed  would see moments fuzz  scanning around  even microsecond fuzz  gon na perceptible happening hundreds times minute eyes scan 
yeah  sadly s true  could get psvr panels  twice resolution  
agree  g2 best blacks lcd panels  still falls short big way  odyssey panel  implemented anti sde extra  makes image smoother pixels harder see 
g2 best bunch  nowhere near close old though  able get side side  s really se bleeding difference 
everything decays time  oleds generally decay high brightness  nt need super bright re right next eyes  light sources  burn also unlikely vr compared monitor  probably nt display stuff time headset
nt heard issues perceived real world experience oled vr headsets 
displays age  lcds delaminate  nobody s oled hmds burning nothing static  burn really issue samsung oleds anyway  s lg issue days 
oleds nt burnin vr hmds nt static ui steamvr always put hmd sleep use  pretty much nonissue 100 oled vive pros ve sold years 
s basically general consensus  m happy hp achieved  whatever verdict whether vive pro 2 good black levelscolours g2  m glad g2 option  shit lcd headset  s really nothing could lol  really lucked think 
big time  least still use want  ‚Äô spending  800 hmd another  300 wireless going want full res 
need compare oculus quest  better index resolution  ‚Äô even use oled wireless adapter ‚Äô even 5k index 130 fov 144hz hmd cost 499 full package 1k  superior controllers 
quest 2 selling every headset market moment s best definitely best price  many people wanting get away facebook htc dropped ball  perfect opportunity make headset compete quest instead standalone headset cost  1300 absolutely ridiculous 
consumers  re competing facebook  re competing valve index  even though specs headset little better  ve lost due improvements controllers  offering oled display  would secure fragment market strongly prefers oled  worst  price nt consumer friendly compared already expensive valve index kit  m convinced htc ca nt design new steamvr controller would already  valve probably heavy lifting vive wands 
already said s loss
yeah  sort alien tech one seen s
yeah  s low persistence  display image shortly  something like 200ms  s black next frame  mention  could vive pro supposedly dimmer vive 
3080 suppose m target market  could nt care less eye tracking face tracking wo nt adopted masses quest  run games like population one 144hz 300  resolution 4k per eye damn near  problem hmd 
course  almost bought g2 based resolution alone simulator games decided wmr  crap fov 90hz cap nt worth side grade 
looking promised 3264x1632 resolution around 50  decrease  either case nt want lose anything 
putting rollercoaster emotions dude 
true  update  also 90hz 
think confusing 5ghz whit wifi6  wifi6 required  anyone upgraded changed isp last 5 years dual band router  make sound like 5ghz new tech  worst case scenario entry level 5ghz router works whit quest2 vdairlink 50   defending 800   headset  dont think issue 50  router  point think  option 1   likely
nearly everyone ‚Äô wireless router days support 80211ac  5ghz   simply getting confused wifi6  80211ax 
think  taking 100200 bucks total price calling day probably better  also say  top class resolution     plays well marketing guess  think reason going lcd route people complain vr headsets expensive constantly  apparently vr enthusiast headsets must cheaper top line phones  even sharing half components   1200 phones nice oled displays reason  mass produced  400 phones  logic apply vr headsets  extent  problem   1000 vr headset  pro 2  nt nice oled display  5 years ago  350 headset  og vive  
 keep reasonable cost yet  s reasonable cost might well go oled
s refresh rate fov limiting oled panels  s stable past 90hz unfeasible get past 110 fov  mention cost well 
yeah  look  would happiest display like current psvr  twice resolution  s  2k resolution rgb oled paired lighthouse tracking would instant order side  long expensive flagship smartphone  
would nt surprised ll eventually  vive pro 2 eye tracking  released eventually 
know streaming videos nt great quality anyways  make sad ppl able watch future wo nt see whole screen rendered highest possible resolution  edit  nothing anyone said far seems contradict said  entire screen rendered highest possible resolution viewing 
120hz wireless mode pc  sure  yes forced link facebook account big deal  let please decide collect data  dont trust facebokk one inch giving data em 
also saw specs  resolution per eye  1832x1920 fov  89¬∞ even near valve index vive pro 2 man also keep eye specs  valve index following  resolution per eye  1440x1600 fov  107¬∞ vive pro 2  resolution per eye  2448x2448 fov  120¬∞ vive pro 2 wireless  resolution  per eye    2448 x 1224 soon  3264 x 1632 alone fov big difference tho
advantage resolution  index bigger fov  144hz  better controllers cheaper  wireless adapter full resolution  really 99  people skip 
‚Äô like amd releasing card less power money even close market leader
m looking range test results  varies  seeing results 110 horizontal  m convinced provides fov people results seem vary  seems common test results getting closer 110 horizontal hmds  s slightly promising see  someone going vive pro vive pro 2  increase would small  coming rift cv1 example     theoretically noticeable improvement  said  bought index one point horizontal fov improvement minimal  impressive felt barely different reality  doubt going anything impressive  resolution perfect  fov improvement disappointingly minimal  ok  nice least extra fov resolution  audio valve index speakers  s disappointing  entirely depends black levelscoloursglare  whether good g2  following  comfortable  audio least pretty good  course expecting par valve speakers though  s 100  deciding factors  s likely poor regard unfortunately  m hopeful 
yes dependent upon factors whether get officially stated maximum fov  s unlikely means 120 degree horizontal actual experience  since vive pro 2  simply say officially maximum 10 degrees larger diagonally compared vive pro  impressive either way 
degree would concede modicum tech savviness overcome things  great alternative  fiddling used nt really compatibility problems anymore  pure hardware viewpoint  pimax arguably best terms  5001500 pcvr price range 
index controllers 100x better wands 
yeah people hate wands waaay much  re fucking tanks compared valve s controllers 
re australia various places valve nt ship  mention huge supply problems plagued index since release two years ago  pay around  700 aud get knuckles australia  would either buy secondhand heavy inflated price buy valve get shipped us uk 
s top tier though  specs headsets better trade one thing another  everything btier right one give specs totally possible today  nt even care price would  happy pay toptier vr nt exist  everyone cut something nt year headset released 
yeah  well really get good colours lcds  s possible  push better colours get awful response times  oleds panels top grade colours whilst maintaining top grade response times 
s barely vr games dlss support far  come  right 
fair enough  thanks responding 
different moving head
yeah  fact ve never heard burnin oled vr headset 
 deleted 
wireless compatibility  index wireless announcements wireless compatibility future 
index god rays pretty bad  maybe vive pro 2 betterwho knows 
would nt compare quest well  s mainstream headset  price aside  people like quest wireless  vive pro 2 performs better wireless  nt need 5k  better quest regard 
think lot easier say ‚Äú ‚Äô competing facebook ‚Äù 1218 months ago know tons people buy quest2 mainly pcvr  ‚Äô think rare people entering space compare q2  index  vive pro 2 fail see much value vive offer  honestly ‚Äô believe spec bumped hmd ‚Äô touch controllers 
games  think pop one would pretty light pc since nt different quest version  3070 tears stuff  quest 1 much lower resolution
ve ordered one keep pro 1 wireless  ll use pro 2 standing still games  pro 1 things require movement  best worlds 
listen  m wireless  og vive wireless  currently  use quest 2 vive pro eye wirelessly  major points frustration quest 2  1 facebook  know  s said  major downside  2 slower controller tracking  really feel latency beat saber  3 controllers nt track beyond field vision  huge negative compared vive products index  like grabbing waist back items example playing snowboarding games  4 ipd range way low big head  ca nt wear quest 2 10 minutes without eyes straining 
said  interest using oculus device unless 2 player vr mates etc  wireless  think currently basestation style tracking better  given option oculus otherwise  would stick 
yea mix initially bad  ironically mine doesnt thats piece shit business router made draytek supplied work 
tell ca nt right  production  s preproduction oled panels around ll  re running  literally  upwards  15000 last checked couple months ago 
‚Äô really disappointed see lcd new vive  hoping would new oled leader  lcd ‚Äô get ultradark blacks games like beat saber elite dangerous need immersion 
nt know s matter enthusiast headsets overpriced  much simply expensive relative benefit  aka  vr high resolution   use phone everyday multiple hours  least 2 years  sometimes 5   s lot better argument spend  1k vr headset might use times week   honestly  likely leave sitting time   obviously vr bit enthusiast market general  need good graphics card good headset  mention big enough place live keep open space  would love able buy aio headset sacrifice graphics resolution cheap simple use  thus appeal quest 2 something becoming accessible  read  cheap  generally benefits enthusiasts  since lets enthusiasts lower budgets  display wise  ca nt wait microled  think oled quite suited dual demands high resolution high refresh rate 
s m saying oled would unreasonably expensive compared spec lcd  would rather less screen door much lower persistent panel  know sub m prepared downvotes  sure experiences better oled s whole use case  also every lcd equal  reverb g2 actually decent black levels lcd panels example 
yeah worthless since games would take advantage  built vive pro 2 least would chance support
yes   screen always rendered perfect resolution point user looks  peripheral view low resolution  system works perfectly  whole screen appears full resolution user  whole point  nt render user ca nt see anyway 
believe human eyes high fidelity receptors center vision  even colors outside center start wash  brain makes lot goes 
120hz pcvr wireless nt thing yet airlink yes already exist virtual desktop  really cared privacy much would nt carry device pocket tracks everything say  google always uses microphone target ads m willing bet still use  p
mean nt arguing quest 2 best headset spec wise  far best value wise though   said nt wireless pcvr competition htc telling wrong  btw quest 2 actually beats index resolution proabably keep eye specs
index fov significantly smaller  107 degrees horizontal index vs 120 degrees vive pro 2 rest true 
leader new release  vive 2 next gen
well  110 renders  physical face structure alter individual see  index 5 degrees wider vive 6 degrees wider vive pro  face structure allows max vive index would probably unnoticeably wider  could however possible index allows people max fov design choice 
 nlikely means 120 degree horizontal actual experience    since vive pro 2  simply say officially maximum 10 degrees larger diagonally compared vive pro    impressi mrtv confirmed 120 horizontal 
think even fixed issues people  may done  nt following closely   would need big pr push convince people headsets worth buying 
imo exception beat saber  literally every game  especially finger presence   index controllers much better nt even funny 
makes bad unless re prone dropping time  nt want controllers weigh ton s s replica gun vive tracker 
ok valid points get would solution  though expensive 
get saying  specs alone would probably choose vive pro 2 headsets available 
never par oled  way better get lcd headsets  g2 good contrast colours compared lcd headset  approach near oled quality cases  m hoping least good contrastcolours g2  s bare minimum 
 thought still developed 
wait  move eyes real life  focus already real life definition  move eyes foveated vr  software track  change resolution focus point blurry high def  misunderstand point 
virtual desktop shit compression though  standalone shit graphics  defacto highest end wireless experience possible 
vive wireless compressed using displaylink software  takes 20  cpu  ‚Äô really good compression algorithm 
‚Äô  ‚Äô stick vive pro  least oled
price  ‚Äô even league price wise 
pop one super light  things like beatsaber eleven table tennis thrill fight  typical vr looking game would run problem max res  walking dead half life alyx d looking 90hz sure think would work fine  120hz index decent supersampling  30 less fps work ca nt say sure  simulation games like assetto corsa might need subsampling  90hz  msfs 2020 running nice 30fps reprojecting 3x problem d imagine s people pull g2 lesser hardware  nt see issue 
og vive  pro  ll see 
oh damn  source  way point direction  would like check time time 
definitely agree  would pay premium oled option  unfortunately think enough metypes around justify product guess 
yeah man  exactly thoughts  m still holding og vive  index controllers das hahaha
could nt agree
tend agree  thing  nt like monitors much  vr headsets much better monitors play game anything computer  play pancake games og vive  thing regret resolution  s  nt really like vr games much  even enough space play  want games m already playing  real 3d front  s  vorpx blessing skies  sort hacking games hahaha
sadly phone using googles stuff since 90  devices would nice huawei since google abondoned em eco system trustful idk  xd aye got good point  heavy use facebook account vr side  let owner decide 
yep right think personal preference  sceptical quest cuz never tried left like  maybe someday give try try quest 2  battery expansion headset  read lasts 2h  confirm  experience 
idk quest 2 index index looks better thats pc quest maxed 17 x link slider  still use though place sure
highly doubt  according  vive1pro higher fov  110  index  107   vive since 2016  pro work index since 2019 directly compare index fov significantly wider horizontally vive  even vertically  thin replacement face cushions close gap little  expense comfort  still see new vive pro enthusiast option  especially already base stations index controllers 
120 horizontal
hahhahaha fantasy world live
doubt  would touting 150 diagonal
ve dropped tens times 3 years working fine  compared friends getting bad issues knuckle controllers 3 months  much prefer durability feature design day
dlss 21  introduce vr support  nt yet naturally nt games using technology  s coming s anything like flat games ll enormous boost performance  ll definitely need vr high end games 
believe point made moving head vr adjusts scene ‚Äô looking starts process rendering new scene ‚Äô noticeable terms response moving eye would possibly require even instantaneous response since ‚Äô motion blur  illusion  hide response times furthermore seems foveated rendering would need major development work hood support popular development suites like unreal unity order effective  would need exist parallel current rendering architecture instead  previously stated  another layer top  ‚Äô know support even close existing  edit  scrolling slightly see implementation tech nvidia https  developernvidiacomblognvidiavrss2dynamicfoveatedrenderingnoassemblyrequired edit 2  ‚Äô something unreal ‚Äô understand ‚Äô interesting fps comparisons end https  forumvivecomtopic7434gettingstartedwithvrsfoveatedrenderingusinghtcviveproeyeunrealengine  ct1582025406
love oled display vive pro  wireless game changer rank  1 musthave features  followed resolution  refresh  fov  color accuracy  roughly order   really depends games play  eg  mainly play seated games forward facing roomscale games  wireless may important  tell level immersion wireless provides roomscale games like like superhot  skyrimvr  subnautica  pavlov unmatched wired solution  also beat saber 360 degree levels super fun untethered 
makes sense  personal choice imo  m holding quest 1 something legit next gen comes  got mine close quest2 announcement nt jump upgrade  hoping decagear good  knows
ll big upgrade  go 
email manufacturers  build relationship   emagine  boe  oledinfocom number links currently nda  say 
‚Äô seeing pimax longer sells 5k 5k xr  might get vive pro 1
run 55  4k tv sit close daily driver  incidentally cost less og vive  hard time going back screen real estate resolution  especially since got used running 11 resolution scaling  nt mind idea 3d space ll definitely need resolution future headset replace  vive og blurry  especially since nt done gearvr lens mod yet due lazy  like idea pimax  without eye tracking foveated rendering thing yet  s way could squeeze performance poor gpu 
fair point  choice  way see re going collect data even connected facebook account nt really mind
yes lasts 2 half hours  s powerbank headstrap oculus sells buy bought  15 powerbank amazon use gives 7 hours total
 according   lol  dude  according  reality  og vive  use every day  horizontal fov 88 degrees  would explain difference ve seen  nt take word  though  use comparisons horizontal  vertical  diagonal fovs   https  vrcomparecomcompare  h10dlrrbmbhgl  h2mlbw9g7f4  h30jluwg808j   https  vrcomparecomcompare  h10dlrrbmbhgl  h2mlbw9g7f4  h30jluwg808j  got ta careful  people mix horizontal diagonal willy nilly 
must eye relief knob turned way back getting 107 index
source 
perhaps want honest fov  since diagonal fov misleading marketing tactic  trying regain consumer confidence lately moves like supporting right repair  ‚Äô think ‚Äô far fetched  also  using double stacked lenses  similar index   doubt ‚Äô waste rnd manufacturing money new lenses get fov  especially ‚Äô trying index competitor ‚Äú prosumers ‚Äù  reused exact vive pro design  headset  speakers  strap  etc  reason  save money  imo reason also reuse lenses made substantive improvement horizontal fov  guess ‚Äô find sure reviews 
yes  radius supports dlss vr 
thanks clarification  good point
wireless adapter  used vive amazing looking announcement possible upgrade index  reading lcd screen wireless 90hz half res ‚Äô go
agree wireless vive pro index controllers top notch  oled screens looks much better dull lcds  htc simply improved pro s oled screen  fov builtin wireless adapter new controllers  slight design changes existing product sell matching price index 
actually got quest 1 right quest 2 well  sold bought quest 2  100 loss  definitely worth upgrade imo 
guess settles  ll take word  thanks 
awesome  thank  yeah  bit hard getting know people technical side things  contacts gamedev side hahaha
would wait  maybe even sony ends surprising us  also  mean pimax 5k xr  5k lcd remember properly 
yeah  could nt agree   usually 2 extra screens connected though  guess next 5 10 years get hopefully 
sounds good use powerbank  since use htc adapter large powerbank could use  yeh guess try one day get one hands xd
sorry  re right  replied wrong post  got mixed long thread  another guy claimed vives horizontal fov 110¬∞
show source  120 diagonal would 150  ‚Äô would touting
well ‚Äô going wait see reviews say fov 
til dlss 21 already released  thanks correction 
yea 90hz limit wireless bummer  hopefully ll make easy switch wired wireless  agree s worth upgrading index especially wireless nt critical  enjoy index  hopefully come 144hz full resolution wireless solution near future 
fence  held required facebook account  used one closed  facebook banned tried make one tried failed get sorted  dont think would sell  200  m going hold 
np  
yeah  took bit   sales fair margin easier   m enterprise embedded dev moving towards hardware looking officially get game dev  least  librarytoolinghardware game dev 
sorry yes  xr
ahhhhh  gotcha  worries  happens  yeah  even close 110¬∞  know well  index s fov absolutely big upgrade  ve tried one recently   hope vive pro 2 s horizontal fov really 120¬∞  would awesome 
well originally source htc specifically said 120‚Å∞  wide  announcement presentation  go  let know words taste  https  wwwredditcomrvivecommentsnbwfqc120horizontalfovforpro2confirmedbyhtc  utmmediumandroidapp  utmsourceshare
good  ‚Äô yet try ‚Äô scared change nvidia drivers ‚Äô got solid system running seem break things every release 
yeah holding breath 80211ay able handle

yes love wider view index  set vive daughter play minigolf together still admire nice oled colors  screens good combo higher fov high resolution vive pro 2 could interesting  even s trashed  people nt mention  blacks contrast oleds really good  scenes really dark  vive gets grainy mushy look  think s ca nt shut pixels 100  avoid black smear 
‚Äô wait actual hands comparison hmds  marketing words ‚Äô mean much
 
know exactly mean grainy look  ve playing lot games dark scenes including skyrim west world lately  course s particularly noticeable loading screens  hour playtime friend s index  nt yet good feel lcd screens compare beyond immediately obvious elimination sde  least partially due subpixel layout  overall nt expect  downgrade  lcd bother  worry lenses  gearvr lens mod vive eliminated godrays made  sweet spot  expand nearly whole fov  would difficult go back something bad original fresnel lenses  htc talk new lens design  hope re better index 
really liked westworld  partly love show   thing gear  never bought something perfect every way  always find flaw  hl  alyx announced  knew wanted play index  remember back doom 3 came  played pretty lores could nt afford better gpu got months later  nvidia geforce 6800gt  yeah m old   kind regretted played better visuals  really blast alyx index  new pc   nt perfect  immersive content good  unfortunately nt play lot anymore alyx could nt find anything came close  personal opinion  know others feel different   think vive pro 2 right compromise  long improves experience looking  need convince everybody else

ehh  s decent value  probably good entry pcvr  original vive headset really bad screen door effect  got mine years ago  quickly looked replace headsets little sde came  s starting show age imo  d also make sure check condition everything buying second hand  edit  think  really good bang buck  still stand hesitation old headset getting would prefer future proof  damn nt good deal  assuming nt beat hellsoaked sweat
nt want ll take
pm link  ll check
deal  og vive got vr  got used headset 2018 m still rocking  added wireless body trackers s exactly wanted vr kid  m happy oculus 2 users  package described far customizable wo nt deal facebook

still solid headset  screen door resolution nt good modern headsets tracking top line still works nearly everything  however  quest 2 still better deal   100 cheaper versatile  arguably overpriced delivers right  controllers basestations put someone good place future headset upgrades   also  make sure friend vr compatible pc 
sold mine  340 recently oculus quest 2 able play without computer  screen door effect  higher resolution really worth 
unless wants upgrade vp2 like guy said quest 2 probably still better deal visual quality original vive pretty atrocious 
d buy flip personally  boring correct answer quest 2 fills people s desires vr
although seems like good deal would never recommend vive time  rest good headset one worst business 
deal
deal
controllers base stations already worth 400‚Ç¨ 
solid deal  go 
controllers alone almost 300
long comes original strap headset  buy  sell headset controllers keep base stations das use money buy newer headset look getting quest 2 put das wait pimax 12k
m wondering   base stations 
kinda depends  short cash first vr headset might terrible purchase  ca nt deny quest2 link visually far superior  value buying mainly either  selling profit b  upgrading headset something better point future  source  vive gathering dust quest 2 daily use 
vive pro 2 m pretty sure lens mod re thinking meant original pro 
yeah thing screen door effect forget second re zone 
lmaoo little fucking rat üòÇ
get vive headset  150
headset  400 rest right though
blatant disregard fact oculus partaking extremely unhealthy practices entirety vr landscape  s good deal  seriously  headset exclusive games small community pinnacle unhealthy practices  normalizes division already small group people  different hardware one thing  played specific piece hardware  s issues  mean  even console games starting crossplatform consoles pc  yet oculus still wants keep oldfashioned  divisive practices  hardware exclusives  
 quest 2 pfff  hell facebook 
agreed 
wort business  really man 
think s means  must oculus user
practice worse resolution pixel fill  audio  ‚Äô oled  much better controllers  etc  later get pimax artisan  index hmd  wait next thing  use another headset space calibrator  fuck quest  great deal 
ca nt deny quest better visuals still preffered vive experience  admittedly smaller  quest experience  vive feels wayy comfier prefer knuckles wands quest controllers  nevermind tracking 
really  definitely nt notice much  couple months started reaaaaally notice  definitely busy sometimes intense games notice  always seems face start read text item effects ever

vr games clearly use ability tilt head hear abovebelow movement audio sources 
 tilt   roll   yaw   looking left right    https  iimgurcomijxkajfjpg   find many people mistake one 
nt  used minecraft bedrock detect audio source like enemies fluids quite advantage vr compared flatscreen 
 good lord  image terrifying b  games  game engines allow sound come objects calculate properly 
many games implement valve s  steam audio   https  valvesoftwaregithubiosteamaudio   check  think re talking headrelated transfer function  hrtf   steam audio stuff much  like sound physics stuff  s really cool 
pavlov  alyx  havent specifically tested others  suspect works games  also budget cuts 
many vr games apply realistic take result using hrtfs  could fun experiment mechanic  actually enchances effect  one could change sound propagates head  already acts minor low pass filter   nt nessasary sound localization though  never seen human tilt head real life locate sound source   hrtfs acts directional filter sound game engine  done properly  help locate sound source without tilting head  since takes ears  rest head  account well  see dogs tilting head trying figure sound coming  s ears good filtering sound waves various directions  try putting play doh ear  close eyes friend snap finger around  hard time figuring sound coming form  hrtfs though  also take environment account account reflections  sound propergation  etc 
least one game optional  pavlov vr need enable   ambisonics   https  previewredditjxkw32ntird61png  width1920  formatpng  autowebp  s7ecf2e02290075d9877db905f5d6d11a0c6dcbd3   allow   sound position simulated 2d plane  saving cpu performance 
would nt recommend  re gon na give people sore neck  vr headsets heavy  s going comfortable looking tilting 
terrifying image  wo nt answer image struck genuine fear heart able sleep nights 
 maybe except shitty vr ports flat games like skyrim  mod  
 thanks b  even ceilings floors 
perhaps bribe  one   https  iimgurcomoi2m06djpg  
yes  although depends implementation  yeah  work ceilings floors 
ordered deluxe audio strap
impression htc stopped making  selling years ago  able buy one direct website  leaving case anyone else still wanting get ahold one new
yes stopped  started  make money somehow 
ooo s sale even  thanks heads  edit  looks like amazon price matching right 
discovered day  according recent sales ebay australia  das apparently  lowers  resale value 
original strap worn headset barely stays m perpetually undecided whether get strap   way overpriced opinion  deluxe strap save money wait index comes back stock 
vive beyond joke  could get standard head strap anywhere  htc vive ireland ‚Äô sell  uk vive ‚Äô ship ireland  get secondhand ebay  ‚Äô get started vive customer support  ‚Äô know ireland uk separate countries       
plus cab use even quest 2 many headstands adapter
well put really high prices everything  always  lose load rmas going back cost  balances 
sale  s ¬£10999  remember getting ¬£99 years ago htc 
s og vive  got deluxe strap beginning quarantine much nicer  said  still sure worth money full price  know m enjoying mine
og vive  save index 
opinion s worth money  even actual audio application ease getting headset  better way going 
maybe ca nt swim    countries around world suffer  often see aussies posting issues  even though re far china 
things expensive  others much  eg  vive pro cable  substantially cheaper index cable  vive og cable also cheap  wands expensive fair think sensors cost lot money make cost  hmds relatively expensive nt seem far valve s pricing 
sorry  us selling  7999 rather normal  99
yeah og vive  think  already controllers need headset  months option stock  wonder ll ever get 
buy vive pro cables new 
ebay option  got og vive released like 5 years ago  sold 3 years later decent price  got another ebay cheap  works perfectly time  recently upgraded vp2  due already base stations index controllers  needed hmd  tempted index  hearing stories worst glare headsets 
htc sells ifixit ‚Äô store 
sell  vivecomuk   https  vivecomuk   probably also  scancouk   https  scancouk  gave site due captchas 
uk ebay looks quite sparse index although could imported  secretly m hoping valve might come new standalone headset  could long wait though  vp2 might good option instead 
short ones looks like 
yeah nt import  something wrong  load hassle  everyone hoping valve something new  vp2 really good  however  rma mine  issues  htc cover shipping  keep getting black screen every vr session  5 seconds  s fine day 1 time  leave vr go back  get black screen 
oh whoops bad  thought vive pro cables  looks like ‚Äô available vive store course stock‚Ä¶
3d printed audio mod vive pro 2
aint vive s native audio great https  imgurcomakktilmx
nt know expected see clicked imgur link  see pair grado s coming
nice work  use microphone 
amazing dude  nice work 
good one  nothing wrong vp2 audio  many people ‚Äô adjusting top strap enough get headphones drop ears properly  find immersive  index ear  comfortable 
humming buzz right ear vive pro 2 way fix  d rather get fixed first attempting serious stuff  nice mod btw  cyberpunkesque man 
sorry commenting quite old post  wondering still print files  would love make something similar 
m gon na play vr rhythm games audio might well quality enjoy listening aye apart sound  cheap secondhand sr60s also perfect mounting system simple easy replace
old cellphone headset earpiece snipped  actually  cheap lavalier would work well  course two cups string would already step vive s builtin mic 
ngl thought pro genuinely good audio incredibly temtping  m glad s worked well 
yes  s difficult keep string taut roomscale games 
vp2 default audio frequency set incorrectly 48000 hz 
trying fix vp2 headphone buzz  checked frequency vp2 sounds  find device  right click  select properties head advanced tab   mine defaulted   24bit  48000 hz  studio quality   like og vive das      set 48000 hz frequency muddies sound attempts upsample  correct frequency 44100 try self listening music  switch back forth track steamvr using desktop view   sound noticeably clearer  btw  never fixed buzz 
curiosity sure 48000 hz wrong 
thanks  also saw 96000 nt know one correct  ll give 441 try  help volume  get decent volume 100  headsets get almost loud 80   enhancements help increase volume seems volume limiter setting nt anything  volume limit setting shows nt headset open vive console
probably placebo  modern sound cards  default rate 48khz  fact support far higher sample rates  re really achieving anything dropping vp2 s rate 441khz  except slightly reducing sample rate  may lose definition  much like setting monitor resolution  want vp2 match whatever sound hardware designed  example  quick check giga realtek onboard soundcard control panel shows default format 48khz  go high 192khz   since industry recordings generally made 48khz  would want headset process frequency  441khz original cd encoding rate  common benchmark  studio recordings generally made 48khz  higher  game audio generally recorded 48khz  dvdbluray sampling  would check audio files game really find  d put money finding modern game audio files 48khz  moreover  software hardware negotiate output  adjust accordingly  wo nt see benefit pushing higher original recording dropping fidelity dropping lower 
16 bits  right 
reminds mic vp 1  shit always shifting pitch updown making sound like kid pedophilia
m audiophile  maybe  think slightly different  trying change back forth eyes closed  harm putting 44100
nothing says full immersion like cd quality audio 
confirm audio frequency needs 44100hz  play video headset  say bigscreen beta steam cinema mode video plays slow voices slowed  deeper  headset set 48000hz 
definitely case das according htc years ago asked device sounded bad  idea device should  set  easy enough test recommend give shot  whatever reason  never hurts better audio quality  24 bit 44100 still studio quality harm choosing sounds best 
48khz wrong anything  different sound setups different settings  cracklings happen sound settings windows sound set something 48khz example  mismatch windows sound settings audio settings software like voicemeeter soundcard creates problem op facing  solution simple  set settings rate
like htc s das correct frequency 44100 hz  pretty standard  volume  help increase volume  higher volume distortion  mud  audio artifacts become pretty obvious  levels tab use adjust volume  setting left earphone windows taskbar  edit  volume limit setting shows nt headset open vive console ha  explains  thought  seen could never find 
well  whatever cause  placebo  blind tests family members aligned  sure system funk  device sound good 48000 hz  easy try  recommend everyone 100  satisfied sound give try   edit   severity might specific pc setup  also subtle overly obvious others  obvious fam blindtested  could definitely tell diff nt seem like big deal  agreed 44100 hz sounded clearer
tried 16 24  44100 sounded  48000  16 24 sounded  bad  worth noting people probably ca nt tell till fix issue  like das  default 48000 tinny robotic artifacts made way sound  vp2 subtle definitely right  48000 edit  default everyone win10  huge oversight htc  95  people never know change  joke
might specific pc setup  also subtle overly obvious others  obvious fam blindtested  could definitely tell diff nt seem like big deal  way concerned neat vr 
lol  use 24 bit 44100 hz still studio quality  16 bit version cd quality  yuck 
well  lot folks seem doubt m caring enough get official answer htc like og vive  das  glad worked  spread word  makes huge diff  ocd stuff like glaring 
 cracklings happen sound settings windows sound set something 48khz example  24 bit 44100 hz still studio quality  check windows set  device easy enough check change listening music 
thanks

using og vive deluxe audio strap gear vr lens upgrades  instead think upgrading different vr headset 
upcoming release new vive headsets  others market  technology much advanced og vive years warrant buying different headset  ve seen reviews vive pro 2 seems cool without head seeing  hard determine ll worth  also nt know much recent valve headset maybe might worth looking well  would recommend  og vive users going  thanks 
nt  great  answer  m mostly boat  og vive deluxe audio strap considering upgrading  least share logic   think big element decision making process depends graphics card  ve got gtx 1080    powerful enough highestend vr content tend run og vive  outside things like flight simulators    m planning upgrading headset unless get hands better graphics card  challenge  think worth remembering mixandmatch equipment htc valve ecosystems  long re compatible base stations re using  re using original 10 base stations vive  upgrade   controllers valve index controllers  everything work fine   road  swap vive index vive pro 2  everything continue great  later upgrade 20 base stations  ve upgraded rest equipment compatible   piecemeal upgrade path might worth considering  based finances  graphics card  andor goals comes vr content  though likely slightly expensive long run bundle purchase  s plan  ve gotten back vr recently thanks discovering new games  well old ones renewed interest  want better hand fullbody tracking  m going upgrade near future index controllers probably add set vive trackers  one day  get hands better gpu expect could drive games bit better  ll also upgrade headset either index vive pro 2  significant upgrades  various tradeoffs two  ll take time figure one best suits needs  answer might    determine headset upgrade appropriate  consider feel missing  current experience  s possible vive good enough  despite pretty old point  s still excellent headset  s reason replace something re happy  re looking minimize screen door effect  improve tracking  expand fov  sorts things like  gpu handle larger number pixels  headset upgrade might  increased fov resolution main interests  also consider something like better controllers might improve experience  though nt yet index controllers  ve used  massively improve experience games leverage  original vive controllers  innovative time  much outdated compared modern controllers  hope least vaguely helpful  happy chat subject want 
used og vive good 23 years  think point s worth long gpu push extra pixels pro 2g2  least 2080ti3070 jump visuals quite amazing  fov upgrade also nice  blacks wo nt nice assume glare worse gear lens  like losing 10  quality 2 categories gaining 200  quality one category  resolution  70  quality another  fov   gains blow mind lot losses noticed 
go get vive pro wireless index controllers  bear mind pc decent enough handle setup  vive pro increased resolution requiers beefier gpu wireless adapter requires modern decent cpu  fact  pretty much modern vr headset require gpu upgrade run smoothly highres  meanwhile og vive run 1060 pretty much ok good luck finding decent gpu sane price right 
gpu  bc unless 2070s  headset way harder run
say fov clarity makes like stop noticing washed empty greyish blacks really really nt  planned get rid vive hung onto play game darkness  thought noticing screen door important thing  wrong  might totally different  would help massively could try lcd  days  hmd 5 minutes see big difference 
m og vive index user 1080 everything far run pretty well  though nt know demanding games test  biggest difference massively reduced screen door  yes blacks nice  sde original vive horrific comparison  playing something like onward shooting range close impossible vive due resolution sde  also vive controllers end controllers  games support finger tracking analogue sticks good  nt feel premium use  games built around buttons  sometimes miss wands 
going get index use lighthouses upgrade knuckles  quest 2 good enough upgrade 
went og vive das index controllers  quest 2 upgrade resolution great  still wish could use index controllers though  black level huge difference  really miss oled screen 
og vive since 2016 got odyssey bit better visuals worse tracking  og vive still main heart  rift even though s technically lost resolution odyssey rgb stripe lcd  plus technique odyssey used sde make blurry  crispness clarity blew away  damned index  happily deep blacks oled chained lcd  nt play many dark games would really noticable  feel opposite trade  picked used cosmos elite  lens mod  later reverb g2 black levels good  rift  index quest 2 s obvious using lcd panel  cosmos reverb g2 nt  vive pro 2 similar black levels might tempting headset  light houses controllers cosmos vive 2 might easiest upgrade give much improved visuals  want want storm allot cash probably pickup used cosmos elite reasonable price  paid  650 cosmos elite full kit  like new  cash vive pro 2 might better option  also getting index controllers would advisable 
went vive lens mod quest 2 massive upgrade around 
depends much play  play 2 hours day definitely upgrade  2 hours week s definitely mandatory 
spot  index controller  headset upgrade far controllers love  luckily work seamlessly vive 
well explained  ‚Äô boat snagged 2080 super lock downscard shortages vp2 preorder  already index controllers agree ‚Äô must  although still use wands beat saber etc   ask use trackers  ‚Äô considering sure best use  feet would ideal secure  ‚Äô also considering wireless think ‚Äô wait faster version get data pushed higher resolution 
nailed
totally  pull vive saints sinners  sucks  lot better games dark  aylx sure oculus side lone echo  hopefully someone make another oled headset 
1 quest 2 og vive tp cast wireless  didnt want give wireless  index  decided vive pro cause id spend yet another 300 top headset price wireless since tp cast isnt compatible   got quest 2   300400  think gives best value waiting something newer  vive pro 2 good reviews  would want wireless  adapter limits 90hz  14 resolution saying go 12 resolution time future 
re saying  og vive   without das  gearvr lens upgrade  wireless   given choice either index hmd controllers d go controllers  og vive das  gearvr lens upgrade wireless wondering whether index controllers next upgrade  sell get like reverb g2 something  re available country re pretty expensive import  wondering s good choice 
alright  re going get info bargained  question  use trackers  haha  m newly minted furry  particularly pandemic everything  vrchat become defacto meeting place furries online  folks create  hire artist create  avatars furry characters use vrchat  obviously  experience made significantly better entertaining everyone involved ve got fullbody tracking  requires  preferably  two trackers feet one waist  multiple companies sell straps feet belts waist trackers screw  would also cool get vr streaming  also benefits greatly full body tracking multiple different games  wireless  yeah  would cool  honestly cable nt bother  cable suspension solutions available one day   d much rather deal drop outs increased cpu load   probably  compressed image end  said  know purposes folks wireless really preferable  s definitely important differentiation index vive headsets folks 
haha knows  saints sinners middle playing making switch  super wounded  especially index seemed more 3d  somehow  d finished lone echo vive already nt need bother  holding detached downward spiral till break old faithful 
interesting brought saints sinners  play game index looks terrible washed grey s screen door effect  tried g2  game looks absolutely amazing really makes realize much better blacks  oled acceptable take   combine razor sharp resolution suddenly game absolute joy play  pro 2 get anywhere near feeling increased fov base station tracking re great place probably retire og vive 
sure least till try head set know want much  re gon na miss blacks vibrance hate glare love everything knuckles wands if re anything like  could go g2 stuff applies sharper display heard lot bad things controllers  tracking 
1 thanks
vive pro 2 speakers  constant static soundhum 
got headset testing bit  headphone speakers noticed something weird immediately  low static sound hum coming time     matter low high sound  even pro2 speakers completely muted  level background  tone loud  irritating say least tother sound playing  clearly hear time  anyone else issue  fix  put back store ask another one  never og vive  vive pro reverb g2  still planning sell 
yes   besides  like  loudness effect  vp2  preferred neutral sound vp1 
yeah  confirm  try setting  perhaps use headphone 
 also another thread discussing issue  https  wwwredditcomrvivecommentsnrqr51pro2buzzingnoisefromheadphonesinsilent
think somebody yesterday said changing nonmultimedia vive device windows fixed  apparently s two vive devices listed 
got mind confirm humming sound speakers nt playing sound
s really frustrating realize vive headset still audio issues 
im bummed speakers coming g2  worlds apart  especially pistol whip us  fun  anymore  120 hz feel nice  glare lesser crisp picture also  ahh want lh tracking g2index qualitiy  realy rooted htc  
m really wanting vp2  would able use das 
nt notice buzzing vp2 rtx 3080 uk  mention different countries use different power frequencies 
sound like  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vq4hfetiuojw
using headphones quick fix  ‚Äô hardware issue htc made aware necessary get replaced 
nt know vive pro 2 vive vive cosmos two audio outputs  via hdmidp via usb audio 
checked  one output sends sound vive pro 2 running pair headphones usb c output hmd seem workaround moment 
need check  notice another  mutimedia device lol  typo years 
plug type c headphones stock headphones bad 
nt think  das  quest 2  nt see way attach vive pro pro 2 
m uk based issue  probably wo nt notice first unless silent scene  eg  steam home   noticeably degrades audio quality  still perceptable audio playback 
havent noticed tone pitch changes
yeah changes tone  pitch depending dark scenes bright scenes also whether 90hz 120hz used   bright scenes worst 
right  hear really audio playing  lh station sound like jet 
dang  guess got ta use duct tape
tried listening quiet environments  games audioshield  nt hear anything like  ve got latest drivers  run intel 6700k  windows 10 pro  new build house  nt change audo settings  people said windows audio settings fix   use vp2 link box previous headset original vive 
checked  mine actually change pitch  s always buzz 
hmm ‚Äô right either  sounds like bad luck hardware  p
personally think resort bluetooth headphones  ideal  buzz makes inbuilt headphones noticeably crummy  m planning face mocap headset nt really want sacrifice single usbc audio solution 
f   k htc   automatic audio switching
tolerate lot crap bloatware  learn vive pro 2 doesnt automatic audio switching  basic aspect sof steamvr day 1    vive console ‚Äô seem offer automatic audio switching headset back  normally handled steamvr  vive pro 2 ‚Äô seem abide settings   source   https  wwwroadtovrcomhtcvivepro2review3  m big fan vive pro hardware dealbreaker 
headset ‚Äô officially released yet  presumably  many bugs software side yet ironed  ‚Äô give time 
really nt see manufacturers ca nt native steamvr
check soundswitch  use exclusively tons things including vr works great  setup hot key  s left crtlf4  switch sound settings fly  works great things like switching input headset discord  music production  etc  edit  wrong link  use one instead   https  soundswitchaaflalome   https  soundswitchaaflalome  using something like soundswitch s non issue  half time oculusvive windows nt switch properly anyways 
latest vive software actually addressed issue   
windows automatic audio switching  simply set headset default sound settings s plugged enabled next time audio device gets activated windows auto switch  back s disabled  nonissue 
device still 3 years go 
pimax issue blamed valve  recently valve funny steamvr beta  famously lacking button motion smoothing  bet ben using  lots ui changes bugs introduction able change fov world scale steamvr 
yeah like steam 100  rendering resolution completely wrong 
guess  m going hold huge hope  really cant understand cant use steamvr  wheel need reinvented peddle viveport 
thanks dude 
patch notes somebody test  thanks 
non issue always hmd audio youre using  lots people use voicemeeter  nvidia broadcast  wireless headphones  theres need htc play ball
proper rendering resolution steam  ‚Äô least 100  run native resolution 
one index old htcvalve codesigned headsets use steamvr  pimax  oculus  xtol  wmr  would nice everyone could get page  one 
get pro 2 already  check fix u 
 hmd audio device disabled unplugged  steamvr stuff nt running  windows auto switch back  also re using voicemeeter mirror audio output hmd without switching 
100  previously showing 2588x2588 closer 3427x3427  update last night s different 
100   tho fair thr oculus quest 2 vd experience fairly seamless streamvr
yeah sad cause valve tried lay much groundwork everyone could play together  yet still manufacturers add custom bloat onto everything 
steamvr  try changing audio output another device check audio output  eg  desktop speakersheadphones  check whether sound plays selected device remains vp2 also  try restarting steamvr seeing chosen output remains selected restarting effect  ty dude  
resolution 2448x2448 per eye right  ‚Äô going 3427x3427 supersampling  would look better ‚Äô minimum native resolution 2448x2448 
changing audio path working  restart steamvr  audio jump back hmd headset  result looking 
s vr rendering works  nt render panel resolution  generally always render around 14x panel resolution account distortion  every headset thus far renders panel resolution  reverb g2 steam 100  3168x3100
great  restarting steamvr reset audio device headset 
ahh forgot lens distortion  great point  makes sense 
think mrtv said resolution combating distortion much lower vive pro 2 compared g2 
yes  set audio path pc speaker restarting steamvr  jump back hmd restart automatically 
yeah said originally  vive updated software increase 100  steamvr ss  full shit 
okay thats huge pain ass definitely progress   cheers mate 
s kind jumping conclusions  maybe perceive barrel distortion something closer native res  s pretty honest review think whatever happened probably honest mistake m sure find s mistaken correct  review like voodoode 
ridiculous vr  experts  reviewing headsets nt realize steam vr resolution wrong  proceed whole section  performance  headset much better g2  headset nt performance  anyone knows anything computers knows rendering less pixels would increase fps  sloppy work 
sound game works steamvr home menus
blackshark v2 pro headset hopped vr everything working fine steamvr home menus changing output device settings  tried playing ragnarock  beatsaber  vrchat sound games  even checking sound settings without finding output settings  anyone idea might  tried turning thx spatial thing aswell luck
maybe check pcs sound playback device  ive cause issues defaulted something else  games restart changing
fixed  restart pc 
lot complaints regarding lack sound steam vr apps   somewhat unexpected  solution  1 start steam vr pc  2 go windows control panelsoundadvanced sound optionsapp volume device preferences  change setting  steam   default  device represents vr headset  example  oculus virtual audio device    3 fix problem  confirm  leave control panel desktop start app using headset  see hear sound headset   revisit desktop windows control panel  may use virtual desktop  simply take headset   see app name listed  steam  perapp device selection   change setting device represents vr headset  oh would necessary beats  talk steam guys 
default playback device already headset ill try  
hmm maybe check stream vr settings  turn audio mirroring maybe fix
didnt work either sadly
hmm sorry sure  m actually familiar headset wanted help  thing could think audio drivers  works places others  extra strange
tried counts  appreciate  thoughts exactly
audio quality vive pro 2 included headphones 
ve heard mixed opinions headphones pro 2 many say sounds awful  weird since headphones deluxe audio strap kind decent  least awful   audio important thing immersion could real deal breaker worse deluxe audio strap   
sound quality fine lack nice rich punchy low frequency sound index g2 headphones  noticed mush ears gets better  ‚Äô really much clamping force head ‚Äô designed flip away  wish could mount index  g2 headphones vp2  immensely prefer ear headphones know ‚Äô personal opinion 
vive pro 1  think similar one pro 2 headphone  absolutely fine  much better rift upgraded  biggest problem s hard get good seal  always fiddle around left ear piece 
really bad   10 headphones sound better  volume  low end  clarity  3d positioning noise nothing played suck  audio important vr thus removed headphones  got usb 35mm adaptor plugged ear buds shortened cables ‚Äô cumbersome
audio absolutely fine  issue faint humming sound noise game  barely hear notice listening silent scenes  d rate headphones decent  love volume controls left headphones mic mute right 
love das  onear always better hate break immersion ear  stock  sound noticeably worse das  tested classical music  edm  rock  changed set device fequewncy 44100 hz  sure defaulting 48000 everyone  suspect  maybe getting mixed reviews 
oh god audio experts here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶unless audiophile great  immersive clear  ‚Äô carry much base index ‚Äô fine  prefer ear ‚Äô cut ‚Äô tried trick vr  want senheizer momentum ii like quality  buy add  htc ‚Äô going spend 300 bucks 1200 audiophile headphones  visuals delivers  especially wireless  ‚Äô buzzing thing people speak either lucky 
bad  buzzing electric sound input coming changes pitch depending bright screen  alone makes totally unusable hearing nt damaged far ca nt hear  sound ok though easy remove headphones use audio 
sound headphones laughably bad  major issue original pro thsmey nt listen  ll need remove theses plug pair s actually usable 
sound decent compress headphones ears prevent sound leak like typical headphones  however headphones designed flipped away ears causing subpar sound quality  use rubberbands help secure ear use 3d print clips vive pro 1 https  wwwthingiversecomthing2896509
personally  heard buzz beginning last tests  notice  concerning sound  sound vp1 superior 
humming sound noticeable ‚Äô quiet  ‚Äô music pops   audio quality okay almost steam titles 
imho audio vp2 default headphones actually good hires  thx spatial sound  dolby atmos  andor dts  htc team others aftermarket audio options attach  bose seinnhieser beats etc 
playing indexg2 awhile honestly really 2 major issues pro 2 make people complain  1 ear  s comfortable ear  many people also makes immersion slightly better real life nt feel headphones ears  2 significantly less bass index speakers  argue s actually better balanced better high frequencies re usually vr experience things like explosions  gunfire  spaceships taking etc  even music games vr tend punchy songs get vr move around  reasons would say pro 2 headphones nt bad  especially compared oculus built audio s truly bad   s re outdated ear nt quite match index sound quality s better fit vr 
dogshit  sure mine defect much low literally mid
das also defaults 48000 instead 44100 actually causes sound much worse  really sure believe many aware  vive pro 2 headphones better changed das change 
correct  also defaulted 48000 hz  idea  maybe everybody  sounded awful  going return till found fix 
vive pro 2 headphones better changed das change 
d say sound  often switch back forth dasquest 2 say happy vp2 audio 
vive pro 2 internal audio low cut 8khz 
fix 
ca nt calibrate 8k nt exist
interest  get audio buzzing  many people report  people s hearing range vary  lot people reported constant buzzing audio played 
cut 8000 already  s pretty low indeed 
hear press speaker ear really listen close  s problem tho testing using audacity mic see cuts 8khz 
different people get different levels think  majority  included hear  1 audio game 2 push headphone ear kinda hard
yup returned vp2  first nt notice started playing settings  obvious nothing running could hear everything well  tried pull  headphones away nt pushed ear hard  anything still loud staticbuzzing noise  even low volume settings  worst thing vp2 janky vive console software though  never going get another headset nt offer native steamvr support needs 3rd party app running  guess nt learn pimax  worth frustration 
nt push mine ears  hear quite easily  s levels  depending good person s hearing anyway audio range wax ear etc 
major reason avoided pimax  also earlier hmds  plastic housing cracking distortion  rmaing back china  dodged bullet  thing vp2  would anyone know vive console software ve purchased received  installs  re like  well og vive nt need   rabbit hole go 
luckily nt get cracking cable terrible  getting lot flashing whitecolorful pixels  reported replacing cable worked others nt  support wanted pay  80 replacement cable sold ebay upgraded index pretty cheap  ca nt believe index allows swap refresh rate ingame  games  without needing restart steamvr  s amazing  comfort clarity levels insanely good  yeah surprising thing  like vive  guys first huge vr headset native steamvr support  wtf  lmao  software drove fuckin nuts man  worse pimax software

focus 3 questions  image  sound  battery
hi guys  couple questions  concerns  regarding vive focus 3 ‚Äô find precise answers reviews could find  maybe help answer  would really like buy vive focus 3 really liked vive pro 2 image quality  even though glare truly   ‚Äô want base stations  1  headset connected pc via usbc cable  ‚Äô battery drain  still headset ‚Äô connected  2  image quality comparable vive pro 2  huge difference  since focus 3 receives compressed image usb rather direct stream displayport  something easily ignored like slight banding  3  ‚Äô sound  audiophile  review  bad like quest 2 pimax smas  headphones absolute necessity hand similar index  reverb g2 
focus 3 nt tether often  actually direct charge port back headset plugs directly battery  battery swapping really cool  takes like 5 second pop pop new one  definitely one kind feature  vive pro v1 image comparable  amazing  sound also really nice  m definitely audiophile m really happy sound  especially compared vive headsets  nt index gold standard  ca nt compare 
1 nt tested  although would imagine drains equally fast since nt charge via usb  2 wo nt get image quality vive pro 2  neither tethered via usb wireless   due compression  mainly manifests motion  stationary images look comparable  although still softer   way kind prefer  vp2 drops clarity sharply move eyes around whereas vf3 effect nt pronounced  3 s pretty good  although index level  index headphones highly directional position correctly nt much leakage  vf3 blasts years high volume  privacy mode  appears little  nt need use headphones necessarily  unless noise leakage concern 
m pondering extending charging cable 5 metres running along usb cable charge play whilst playing  rush though nt seem play session long enough fully drain battery rarely tethered  another think whilst typing m wondering charging battery back head good idea  probably 
thanks input  charge battery  using

nvidia hdmi audio sounds lot better usb audio  playback devices select audio output  tried using mini displayport s worth trying hdmi see changes anything 
dp running splitter feeds hdmi port headset  headphones plugged hmd s board 35 sure dp cable makes difference  current driver bigscreen beta audio driver

seems grey screen problem caused vive audio drivers
old original htc vive  sometimes play ot using audio computer speakers  sometimes using headset headphone jack  started getting grey screens playing vive audio  even earphones unplugged system selecting vive audio device  super weird 
interesting  gaming laptop  vive gray screens full minute time  would blink back second  go back gray  time  would claim base stations found  switched usb port plugged  usb 30   seems solved  though need time  testing sure  occurs vive actually 2 audio output interfaces  usb audio  hdmi audio  wonder pcs selecting usb vive audio instead hdmi  somehow interfering tracking  also goes usb cable  try making sure re using hdmi audio  better anyway  
grey screen means tracking lost  means pose reconstruction lighhouse andor imu readings  means enough laser sweep data  transmitted usb   sometimes usb packets handled time  fw stops sending imu data  maybe usb audio device packets impacting  interesting case 
thanks  tried hdmi usb audio got result 
def suspect might usb conflict though  ll try unplugging usb devices see runs

maybe s find 3d audio underwhelming  obviously coming tv speakers nt much  using headphones audio sounds suuuper compressed s honestly bit uncomfortable listen  high pitched noises crashes cracks weird sibilance midrange completely scooped  s meant simulate sensation subbass impact extreme dyanmic range get real world shit like explosions  obviously ps5 headphones ca nt produce frequencies dynamic range ends sounding harsh uncomfortable  also lot work terms modeling sound bounces acoustic surface  right everything kinda sounds like recorded hardwalled room reverb added afterwards  harsh  inorganic  artifical  kinda stuff ton work extremely small returns  re essentially talking ray tracing sound vibrations  sincerely  obnoxious audiophile
imagine s playstation s take spacial sound like dolby atmos
think way  see pixar movie  say  s 3d   put vr goggle s also 3d real time  sense presence scale  thing apply 3d sound  surround sound backed  even realtime positioning occur games  tempest 3d audio tech good s generating 3d spatial sound real time possible raytraced audio reverb occlusion know sound coming left 1 inch head 3 feets 
might need adjust setting  everyone ‚Äô differ 
sure re downvoted  looks stunning well sounding great  really good showcase next gen thought 
demo exclusive ps5 right another demo releasing consoles may  pray includes psvr 
certain curious 
got ta play headphones 10x scary  played twice pussied headphones time imma play handle ready full game 
windows sonic headphone xbox   personally like better atmos  pretty much

isnt binaural sound  3d sound takes position 3d space  binaural  foam head record objects exact position cant move sounds around unless record exact spot  tl  dr  similar 3d move biaural stuck one spot  improving 3d audio sound closer binaural
proof concept around decades  technology implement  psvr breakout box new tempest chipset  pretty cutting edge though 
damn massacre
sure re getting downvoted  3d audio games predates psvr decades
actually tried  pinpoint sounds surprising accuracy 
tbh sound footsteps starting get annoying resident evil games notoriously loudest footsteps game ever lol
incorrect  3d audio audio moves turn head  something sounds like s front turn head left  3d audio makes sound like s right head 
would cool sony took five seconds explain way 
distance environment 
new console sphere   height accounted positional sound nt new 
nt ps5 yet  like every one else waiting chance buy one  m kinda serious audio  please tell ever experience sound dropouts ps5  use wired headset  4 4pro really disliked  hope better ps5  also  sounds like audio profile using nt one  read somewhere select different ones  made different ear types  profiles give result  thanks 
meme based psvr 3d audio since came  ve playing psvr since came  ps5 touting 3d audio  nt impressed  impressive yes  much since ve exposed already  learn laugh
look nice great detail lighting  first thing noticed though first chain clipping wall  sort thing needs gone generation
would love try vr one well 
another thread think rps5 talking amazing 3d audio demo  upvoted comments talking sounds awful  suggestion disable system setting use game one  ‚Äô test soon

‚Äô probably simplifying tempest engine  ps5 uses  obviously little complicated  ya  ‚Äô idea least 
ve never experienced sound dropouts  m plugging headphone controller sitting 810 feet away  nt realize could select different audio profiles  ll check  thanks 
lol  saying ps5 3d audio upgraded  ps5 3d audio fact upgraded psvr audio
nt chain clipping wall guy hanging thin rope portion rope tied something straight ceiling 
m sceptical thread  people saying s amazing  many people seem different settings s clear right one  suspect s placebo effect many people 
sweet next play try  gross testing 3d audio utilizing maggots toilet  hear sure ingame option 4 owners getting game  honestly hits hard like vr experience 7 bit intense players 
yeah footsteps scared would end running away continuing tge cycle scared first 
yeah footsteps scared would end running away continuing tge cycle scared first 
suppose make realistic would replicate real life  powerhouse ps5xbox  makes lot easier implement  nothing anything new per say  example different  oculus study couple months ago make sure sound insanely accurate  put open back headphones person speaker room  people time could nt tell sound coming speaker headphones  thats aiming  sound video games pretty good right want make good tricks brain  ears matter  thinking really space  also havent tried ps5 yet dont know accurate sound truly  goal least
ps5 includes hardware dsp process 3d audio instead using cpu time  game already 3d audio software  s different player
maybe ‚Äô headphones  logitech wireless headset works well  also tried yamaha wired headset use guitar amp  fine 
got ta make perks attractive
s 3d audio  psvr stereo  3d audio makes sound stays environment move head  without head tracking  s 3d audio 
finally eli5 
still dont get s different  honest  sounds good 
tried couple sets  ear bose qcs ps gold headset 
s perk  s field upgrade  called dead silence 
 3d audio binaural audio  two ears  nt hear stereo crossover way sounds reflect shape ears environment allows brain understand things coming  3d audio simulates effect  allowing us feel sounds coming around us  us  closer us  done without vr headset  ps5  adding vr headset simply adds another level immersion  3d audio  sounds actually tracked around head movement well  distance orientation track movement  make 3d audio better  even keep head entirely still  s still 3d audio 
‚Äô imagine simpler way explain 
yeah  understand  im college audio right still confuses lol  defintiely good thing  also didnt even realized username  main mercy  
difference may hear chains rattling game yoo know chains game buuuuut 3d audio hear chain rattling right next right ear specifically know chain immediate right  tell sounds coming like real life 
lmfao binaural means stereo  two channel  psvr literally special box whose job process audio position sounds come stays place move head  re confusing 3d audio surround sound  3d audio spacial positioning sounds  look  nt say moving head   sounds 3d audio stay position  like real life hearing binaural bird tree stationary turn head sound stays place  stationary external speakers additional processing necessary keep sounds coming re coming  speakers stationary  headphonesearbuds move head 3d audio compensates 
quit downvoting explanations  re one nt understand  sorry  grow 
already though 
 lmfao binaural means stereo  wrong  binaural special technique replicates way ears process actual 3d audio placement   psvr literally special box whose job process audio position sounds come stays place move head  s done ps4 makes audio 3d   re confusing 3d audio surround sound  3d audio spacial positioning sounds  look  spatial positioning sounds require movement head  s audio processing technique  called binaural audio  sound move move head enhances binaural audio adding immersion  required 3d audio  binaural audio allows precise audio positioning surround sound  surround sound horizontal ring around listener  usually specific 5 7 speaker positions  3d audio achieved adding vertical positioning  atmos dtsx  accomplished adding speakers listener  headphone based 3d audio  done binaural audio processing allows precise audio positioning listener well better depiction distance audio  example  audio coming  head  accurately represented system  well distant sounds  ps4 also achieved games without psvr using sony platinum headset s special processing mode  ps5 holds audio processor every single game  vr games specifically made ps5   nt say moving head   sounds 3d audio stay position  like real life hearing binaural bird tree stationary turn head sound stays place  neat side effect vr  s required component 3d audio  nt playing vr  camera controlled controller  movies  camera operator  3d audio works sources well  nt get added immersion connecting camera movement head s real world positioning  like said  s neat effect vr happens  s 3d audio   stationary external speakers additional processing necessary keep sounds coming re coming  speakers stationary  headphonesearbuds move head 3d audio compensates  3d audio processed without detection head movement  makes assumption re sitting vertically facing screen  yes  head movement detection done vr enhances  required process sphere audio around player  s done specially designed binaural audio processing techniques  replicating way ears work real world 3d sounds 
 explanations  wrong  downvote misinformation  dolby atmos  dtsx  tempest audio 3d audio systems nt use head movement  psvr absolutely 3d audio  head movement  simply enhances s already 
maybe stop wrong people take seriously
like compared experience 4 5 5 pulse headphones  demo joke comes audio performance  think might download 7 onto 5 done hitman vring see 7 sounds compared 8 great example experience psvr 3d audio current hitman game

thought bookmarked post unique  first time seen part teardowns v1 headset  fairly common problem v2 well  would really liked find fixed headset  frankenstein though use bluetooth dongle tv aux port sync bt speakers  buy stuff though nt  probably close spending would repair sony 
video audio skipping ps5  psvr
basic setup psvr v2 ps5  hdmi runs ps5 processor another tv  m aware doesnt process uhd something like  whenever m running vr processor audio video cut small two second periods random intervals  m sure s vr unit plug ps5 directly tv problem doesnt exist  ruined ps3s hdmi port plugging constantly m really trying avoid  anybody heard fix maybe  edit chance anyone new reads  clear video psvr never skips  vr turned functioning hdmi splitter video passing ps5 tv skips 
s re moving around  s s break somewhere cable
replace hdmi cables  fixed many others  cheap amazon basics ones fine 
 vr works fine  m saying vr turned hdmi passing vr ps5 tv causes video skip 
thanks much ll try  edit  got new cable nt seen skip day
psvr2 audio
remember  sony pulse 3d ps5 headphones   https  cdnalzaczimgwashx  fdf4  cdmsx005pu1  i1jpg  got released  people noticed well design goes psvr  looks fits around headset many assumed would goto headphones psvr2  ago m hoping re gon na something better audio  index came headphones hover ears without touching results much realistic sound  hp got partnered valve used reverb headsets  new vive focus 3 came  version directional speakers sound leakage reduction   https  youtubexugsmitjhsm  t39   nt think sony get away releasing cheap earbuds option plugging headphones time around every hmd market decent built audio solution  one thing know nothing even leaks nt touched  predictions would like see audio department 
honestly think ll go earbuds similar original psvr  maybe slightly higher quality ear like psvr1 v2 redesign  real magic 3d audio know ps5 custom chip psvr2 take advantage designed work earphones  people want better quality sound  certainly deeper bass  think ll stump money  main reason cost savings hit  399  thereabouts  
ehhh ‚Äô know ‚Äô opt audio solution similar index  limited budget work  money spent headphones spent million things headset  finding balance really hard  clip accessory would make ton sense 
bingo
sound coming headphones
ve psvr year  long ago   ps4 black screened deleted data  psvr started work  sound specifically  ve tried tips somewhat successfully found google turn sound make sure everything plugged restart console hear sound  cuts every 12 seconds  comes back  s extremely static help welcome  notice nt dropped vr  damaged anything degree 
go settings ps4 make sure hdcp turned  headset started blackout  sound issues  turning setting seems fix everything
sounds like hardware fault  faulty capacitor  would need warranty replacement  said  think s related ps4  try another system rule software issues  full wipe os installation might help software 
thought  gets even weirder  turned far point  sound nt work turned beat saber  sound worked perfectly fine  little glitches quick second leave song go ps4 menu turned far point  still could nt hear anything turned game vr  everything worked perfectly   
breakout box 3d sound processing psvr  could plausible game like beat saber ‚Äô really use 3d processed sound much farpoint  hardware issue breakout box could fact cause kind behaviour 
re right  weird  although kinda agree thefr33  still  whatever cause  path clear   test another ps4  fails  call sony repair vr  works  backup saves  hard reset ps4 safe mode using full os reinstallation usb stick  still nt work  something hardware ps4 narfed also  thought something  3d audio think goes usb port  re using hub  also  replace usb cable

amazing specs  ‚Äô become clear vr needs wireless move forward 
thing teased  game changer     ll stick quest 2 s wireless pcvr  s gamechanger
 750 email promo
pre ordered  fingers crossed  ‚Äô big jump vive og  add wireless later knuckles better later  resolution kicker needed index ‚Äô ship australia warranty  ‚Äô 
least compatible previous wireless adapter  yeah  80  increase resolution  cost  1000  massive downgrade contrast 
got valve index offear sound thing nt 100  like  vr works best re fully immersed  kind kills immersion noises outside headset nt blockedmuffled  sound quality great face gets less hotsweaty  horror games scary ca nt get deeply immersed 
see reviews  yeah  m sure flimsy lcd s better colorbrightness wise even compared cosmos 
wireless ton limitations still  5k 120hz wireless  yeah  yet  wired best way get vr  freedom wireless also considered  good know compatible vive wireless adapter
never care wireless  recently return quest 2 give best vr best spec    x200b  move vr forward  need triple company start making games vr  right  games look like straight crap 
well  says compatible vive wireless adapter  even 90hz  specs might good  see comparisons lcd  nt think high resolution come  free   ll passing anyways  space games look like cheap trash like lcd headset  anything dark scenes ambiences 
wireless wifi wigig  know 
get email promo work  tried refuses work  tried 3 different email accounts none work 
thinking upgrading og vive  oled killed sadly   hope enjoy though 
bemoaning lack built wireless  wireless adapter vive pro  s taxing cpu  never use vive pro wirelessly since got quest 2 s convenient throw q2 play rather deal hassle switching wired wireless pro 
know believe replace valve index speakers headphones  really issue 
yeah really sucks  oled wireless 120hz   thing would get upgrade vive pro  even old resolution fov  maybe another year two 
yes  originally ordered without promo someone said vive pro get  later saw inbox cancelled chat reordered worked 
watch reviews 
fair enough  yeah  processing needs done somewhere  putting chip headset  going increase price substantial amount  would happy improved wireless adapter v2 something line would make convenient 
nt know cpu i5 9600 5800x nt see impact  would nt make sense 9600 500‚Ç¨ video card 
s eu store f      ed  go chat order mine  upgrading index upgrade og vive 
wait   nt seen reviews anywhere yet  also  weird say preordered without watching one  
i9 9900k  wireless adapter absolutely impact play flight sims like dcs il2  anything heavily physics based lots ai units causes video compression issues lots stuttering  issues playing games like hl alyx 
sorry  meant  taking risk hoping deliver specs real life ‚Äô great upgrade path  hesitant  wait reviews hope üò¨you end buying thus supporting  present  risky decision  good luck
unfortunately s easy plug back original cable going back wired sometime  like seated  nt play cpu intense games  i5 4690  upgrade  games could nt run  like arizona sunshine  even pavlov ca nt run 
ah  see  understood  nt think worry much  know make good headsets  m susceptive bad contrast  specially space games dark environmentgames  even best lcd vr headsets market  would nt good enough  since technology limited thing  purchase knowing  m sure great experience

ve og vive 2 years without mods without deluxe audio strap  missing much 
ve heard lot positive reactions gear vr lens mod deluxe audio strap  nt use tried either  missing much  buy point  late 
re going keep vive much longer  highly recommend wireless adapter  recently upgraded pro2 splurged wireless adapter  honestly ca nt imagine going back tethered  ca nt speak two never tried  remember though  gear vr lens upgrade nt much one  ca nt imagine worth  129 new gear vr 
imo  point might worth upgrading piecemeal index ve got money  s  400 das s also entire headset overhaul instead comfort ease access improvement  plus however much d need blow gear vr cut apart mod headset  otherwise  dunno  happy headset current state  reason go blow couple hundred dollars fix nt broken 
nt gear vr laying around  s worth modding vive  ll improve clarity  ll still looking low resolution pentile screen  agree cap  wireless would upgrade get  move vive pro vive pro 2  need  50 kit use adapter new headset  das also excellent would way go wireless outside budget  s comfortable sound considered good index came along 
played og vive 2 years original headstrap  actually loved elastic  needed good counterweight back made strapping water bottle perfect amount water balance  anyways  means  upgrading index  far  worth visual fidelity upgrade offear speakers  controllers good  important headset imo 
das gear vr mod  intend using vive good longer  d suggest trying lens mod  s easy results great  hard part finding right settings make slight distortion best  follow guide somewhere reddit easy  das  ve never used original strap ca nt tell s worth  love mine  frame reference outside  like keep things  d say go  fun 
vive since 2016 got deluxe audio strap 2017 massive improvement comfort yes think missing  ‚Äô upgrade feels pretty mandatory  vr hours due  even play non vr games  often stereoscopic 3d  rocket league using vorpx  unavailable due risk ban ‚Äô even play pc games giant stereoscopic virtual screen  playing pubg like surprisingly immersive despite lack stereoscopic 3d lower resolution 4k tv 70 inch tv  yes think og vive trumps tv even non stereoscopic games

issue year s seemingly getting worse recent windows update  instead better   playing game vr  s completely random occurs  sound cut loud shocking robotic static sound coming headphones    currently playing    samsung odyssey    32 gigs ram   x570 aorus elite   ryzen 5800x   rtx 3080   x200b  things tried fix issue luck    purchased pcie external usb 30 hub runs directly psu power supply   reinstalled wmr  steamvr  drivers   reinstalled realtek drivers default also tried ones recommended motherboard   lowered sound quality realtek drivers 32bit 16bit dvd   lowered sound volume vr game   x200b  issue completely random  sometimes 5 minutes playing  sometimes 3 hours  s shocking  loud  borderline painful  completely ruins vr experience  nt believe support wmr future     x200b  update 242021  played 2 hours without audio static blasting today  m going assume fixed sometimes occurs 5mins3hours game time  bunch steps today including    in steamvr developer settings  option disable windows power management usb ensure steamvr utilizes power  clicked unplugreplug odyssey    in bios  set fusb31c auto gen 2 learned via internets  gen 2 ensures 3031c usb s utilized faster rate  s set gen 1  essentially ubs 20 port    resize bar support  enabled  nt know bios update rolled already rtx 3080  course enabled improved performance reasons    xhci handoff  disabled  nt seem like necessary option usb ports    pciex16 slot config  switched gen 4 gen 3 since believe gen 4 spotty sometimes   pcie slot config  switched gen 4 gen 3 reason  actually noticed decreased stuttering playing games wmrsteamvr waaaay less tracking issues  overall improved stability  fingers crossed  final update 282021  fixed  changing settings 242021 update  played many hours without crashing  loss tracking  static audio blast  conclusion default settings x570 motherboard compatible wmr potentially due usb settings  switches  eliminating cpu overclock closing msi afterburner  one multiple things ve done   completely eliminated issues longer even need external usb hub motherboard handles vr headset correctly flawlessly 
used exact issue  much reading issue ordered usb hub  4 port black superspeed usb 30 hub https  wwwstartechcomencacardsadaptersst4300usb3 s external powered usb hub static issue never came back hooked  also hooked 6ft usbhdmi extended cable give space vr  works great 
used similar problem previous internal audio card much searching found problem nvidia hdmi driver  inserts windows audio stack make sure hdmi drm chain secure input  blueray  output  monitortv speaker   one uses shit nowadays anymore  yet injects s way install  since otherwise windows update adds older one  resulting even problems  way get rid open device manager  browse system devices find high definition audio controller  properties  details  hardware id contains ven10de  right click disable device  clean reinstall nvidia drivers  nt install hdmi drivers  usually holds windows feature update  case usually reenabled 
either two things   try setting headset s audio dvd quality  sound control panel  o headset  realtek usb audio    default value  studio  windows sets incorrect headset s audio chipset  ve read    use powered usb extender  yes single portcable  hub   inject  amperage motherboards  possibly  pcie cards fail provide  things o nt issues since seem vary users pc configurations  also sidenote  usually tell o getting enough power move ipd slider steamvr  overlay showing value instant means delivering required amperage  quite strange know 
noticed static burst occurs rarely many usb devices connected system  could try disconnecting usb devices vr session troubleshoot  threads around wmr tends bit problematic amd motherboard s usb connectivity vs intel 
using extension cables plugged directly computer  issue apparently power delivery inconsistent usb extenders something stopped using problem went away 
much also hate  ‚Äô thoroughly discussed solutions  ‚Äô issue personally   also odyssey develop daily unity  1 usb pcie cards equal  support spec properly  one specifically  2 using right drivers usb card  also ‚Äô created equal  3 check windows power settings  need high performance experience 4 instead messing sound quality  disable cortana  voice recognition 5 check bios settings see ‚Äô undervolting usb power supply  6 power psu  ‚Äô strong enough  even psu powered card ‚Äô still gon na happen 7 using extensions   experience  ever happened using nonpowered extensions  particularly sus amazon ones 
temp fix  probably related major problem  heard static took headphones let static continue went couple things stop sound  stopped static reverted normal audio going usb audio device settings turning spacial sound format immediately turning back   temporary reset could related problem 
recently issue upgrading gigabyte motherboard intel cpu asus motherboard amd cpu  motherboard different  prime b450m gaming ii   m sharing case helps someone  seems worked plugging headset usb different port  motherboard 2 different usb ports  blue 31 green 32  supposedly faster  plugged headset 32 port figuring would better connection  started audios issues  switched 31 nt problems since  also changed steamvr usb settings might helped
huge problem lot people seem far could tell nobody microsoft ever commented  hope re aware
need powered usb port  added one never 
im really thinking selling o getting quest 2 link cable point üòî
sounds like windows might think audio device disconnects reconnects  might way force use audio device  sorry could nt helpful

ll tell ya worked  looking hardware  ve got suspicions might help  get beefier power supply  specifically  issue old psu nt enough available 12v rail handle everything plugged  damn near everything running 12v  including pcie usb card bought  s voltage regulation  going 12v 5v  got psu could handle 500w 12v rail  taking account anything else  issue went away entirely  even use extension cables  definitely seems like ve got lot potentially power hungry hardware  s definitely something d wary 
also another link saved issue  worth shot try  https  oldredditcomrwindowsmrcommentse3blorsomeadvicesforwmrowners
hope find solution  ve problem ever since got never able fix  ve seen suggestions thread nt tried  ill give go  way ve gotten around disabling headset audio using bluetooth headphones instead 
check motherboard something like usb dacup  issue good bit troubleshooting found setting  basically motherboard yellow usb ports setting stabilises voltage better shielded given noise reduction 
got skullcandy crusher bluetooth headphones fix issue  nt much lag far notice nt worry power overdraw  works great far 
exact issue  fixed   https  wwwamazoncomgpproductb079gt1zvsrefppxyodtbsearchasinimage  ieutf8  psc1   https  wwwamazoncomgpproductb079gt1zvsrefppxyodtbsearchasinimage  ieutf8  psc1    x570 aorus master  s really nice physical switch disconnect headset 
s related usb throughput  try unplugging anything s usb s essential  also better nt use hubs plug directly possible usb 3x ports  problem solved 
hello fellow odyssey owner deafining static  og odyssey dealing static issue year half  found working solution also tried everything people recommending thread none worked  also tried direct powered pci card powered hub  got rid extension cords  basically everything sun sometimes issue would go away bit always come back  working solution  htc vive breakout box  sure works powered hubs tried  reliable power delivery something  since purchased six months ago  static  yay  hooked 3 foot extension cables stopped static issue  able easily unplug odyssey mounted vive box desk  fyi  saw posts quest 2 well  also quest 1 quest 2  honestly odyssey still looks way better quest 2 really like quest 2 odyssey  simsitting type games prefer oddysey  active type games quest awesome cause stream vr wirelessly virtual desktop  got best worlds good luck 
things check nt see anyone else mention  bios update board couple weeks ago  might worth trying  asus released chipset driver update  would nt surprise see vendors soon  upgrades also using pcie 40 speeds  maybe noise issue board  upgrades made worse   try locking pcie 30 speeds bios test  d mad bought leave  case metal  motherboard back plate make electrical contact psus cover   screws provide connection  looks like blue ports connected directly cpu  red chipset  tried  d stick ports closest motherboard  leave ones right empty test  blue n white one looks interesting  anything interesting windows event log exact moment problem  check system application logs 
pretty easy fix  go sound control panel change 24 bit 16bit cd quality
know mentioned drivers usb controller  ensured microsoft s usb drivers installed  actually labelled   google usb stack microsoft wmr asmedia find results  also referred  though dont call 3rd parties like asmedia  error 712   https  docsmicrosoftcomenuswindowsmixedrealityenthusiastguideerrorcodes   https  docsmicrosoftcomenuswindowsmixedrealityenthusiastguideerrorcodes    x200b    x200b  odyssey back exploding static noise  usb driver issue  also happens usb extension cables 
thank keeping updated  m going try tomorrow even though m intel i5 7600k  3060 middle race iracing  static blast m seeing posted scared ever living shit  nt even know hit anyone leaping behind steering wheel chucking headset wall  ve rifles fired ear  disturb way shit  ve owned two wmr headsets including current odyssey  m  never happened 4 years racing vr 
ok uh  used satechi hub vr headset 30 cable static noise disappeared  easier expected 
hmm already purchased external usb hub recommended  fix  issue  m glad worked 
‚Äô seen one  interesting pov
interesting  found exact audio controller  going give test run disabling reinstalling nvidia drivers 
unfortunately  thinking worked  2 hours gaming happened went deaf day 
ipd adjustment pretty immediate  tried 
changing bios settings usb steam vr fixed  plug directly motherboard without issue ü•≤
yeah unfortunately mouse keyboard plugged outside headsets edit  issues prior updating 30805800x  3800x1080ti previously without issues  plugged gpu directly usb via vrready slot edit  period playing non steamvr games  nt played steamvr games noticed issue
resolved issue taking steps original post edited  definitely issue default amd settings biossteam wmr  probably something bandwidth bottleneck  plug directly motherboard issues 
nope  extension cords  originally plugging directly motherboard found sometimes headset get enough power  purchase external usb pci express hub directly powered power supply instead motherboard  issue persists  believe software issue point power issue 
may power delivery bandwidth issue default motherboard settings  edited original post fixed  running directly motherboard without issue
1 bought since mobo would cause world flip upside vr  usb fixed issue audio  https  wwwamazoncomgpawdb00fpimjew  psc1  refppxpopmobbasintitle 2 yes  3  s always performance 4 cortana vr voice recognition disabled via wmr settings vr 5 hmm  ll see dig around area  61000 watt gold evga psu 7 cable extensions
also try invest usb 31 30
hope well  m assuming affect multiple headsets  ve seen issue new g2 reverb posts believe s issue across wmr headsets  however  since headset new talked s least becoming prevalent topic 
resolved issue edited original post  think s default settings amd s bios creating irregular bandwidth headset 
buying powered usb pci card fixed  microsoft comment reddit  said ‚Äô power delivery issue 
powered usb port  unfortunately  luck 
‚Äô trade away odyssey oled panels facebook crap lol  wmr  knows oculus around postfacebook
makes logical sense  wondering try disable audio devices manually 
tried issue persisted unfortunately 
editing bios steam vr settings able get running perfectly 31 usb motherboard  thank 
1000 watt gold evga power supply 
interesting  nt seen one yet  ll add list give shot  m going try one thing time way try isolate issue eventually find fix ll repost 
actually tried  however headphones two issues  issue number one  headphones plugged output motherboard seem lose directional audio vr headset sounds around correct accurate  second  headphones barely fit around headphones already attached samsung odyssey headset makes feel practical ears squished directions  earbuds might good way around bluetooth 
setting  bios setting 
definitely multiple motherboard bios usb settings fixed issue  thank
yeah would last ditch attempt work around issue 
hmmm  s pretty cheap  nice find  ll try problem persists since s cheap enough 
fixed able plug usb directly 31 usb motherboard edited steps original post  external usb ü•≤
tried usbs motherboard things really bad lost tracking sound issue  bought external usb fixed tracking audio issue 
interesting   https  wwwamazoncomhtcvivelinkboxpcdpb01lxr6dkvrefmpsa15  dchild1  keywordshtcvivelinkbox  pdrdr424075164b814249a736247235e0951f  pdrdwcrtjr  pdrdwg1r5ne  pfrdp4223292f5e3e4e2fabdeab59b33e7b79  pfrdrgzzdnsx1zkye0z5fkk1p  qid1612391463  sr85
pci 3 list tinker completely forgot  thanks reminding  ll check bios update well  get one past month access ryzen curve optimizer  tried usb ports unfortunately 
already  unfortunately  find mentioning title 
hmm  ll play drivers today work
yeah hope one works  one year later still ‚Äô happen  one settings worked  wish knew one 
yes  may work  ‚Äô work  bought different hubs none fixed 
got one shitty star tech  tiergrade   https  smileamazoncomgpproductb07z34bjyh  pci cards  black colored one inserts motherboard sata power connection  totally fixed static explosion sound issues vr  however  using peripherals  mouse controller plugged pci card  frustratingly lose connection every 30 minutes   issues headset plugged though  audio fine bought  ‚Äô say try buying one powered usb pci cards test thoroughly 
yeah sorry hear  threads ve read  external usb hubs would still give issues static  guess ve also made sure usb cable connected usb 20 higher  guess last resort would reformat  reinstall windows  problem persists know s hardware  makemodel usb port get 
sucks  still sounds lot alike  burst volume 100   even though set 10 
also upgraded 3070 1070 started getting static issue  sucks seems like gpu got make vr better making worse 
long shot using gaming mouse high polling rate  testing could reduce standard 125 hz see eases congestion usb hub 
great discovery  never expected pci gen 4 interfere usbwmr audio  thread pinned sticked users problems x570 wmr 
ve never heard someone using usb hub powered psu fix  use one powered straight mains plug  figured benefit splitting onto power supply  since audio blast seemed begin momentary drop power delivery 
would still try different external powered usb hub like one linked  ve read usb hubs still exhibiting issue due power supply cheap providing enough power hub  swapped different one static  static issue directly related lack enough power certain times thus causing static  lots reddit threads discussing issue 
duly noted  fwiw last year going saw post ugeofffrommsft usb chipsets  would double check see one pcie card uses case  https  wwwredditcomrwindowsmrcommentsa7v48ostuckonconnectyourheadseted3cyyw  https  wwwredditcomrwindowsmrcommentsa4p3sjodysseynotworkinganymoreec10fb1  https  wwwredditcomrwindowsmrcomments8xe741dellvisorusb30extensiblehostcontroller10e23370e
confirm affects multiple headsets  issue lenovo explorer occasionally 
well old intel board must something else guess  unless s similar feature  ve dug bios looking something nt see anything
unfortunately fix  fixed tracking issues random audio issue 
oled vs lcd significant huh  thinking would worth trade intermittent untethered experience games better tracking
windows mixed reality headsets disable audio mixed reality portal closed  could try manually enabling launch vr
based posts wonder psu failing powerful enough
 deleted 
 d definitely concerned issue  curiosity  know many watts psu available rail  tried connecting pcie usb another 12v rail  one  
maybe ur psu  random component  buggered way
yeah also let know goes trying ports usb card  good luck 
yeah  ve using earbuds  s ideal since odyssey headphones kinda push ears wearing bluetooth headphones  works enough let play games without thinking m going go deaf surprise noise explosion ears 
yes  also make sure using one ports supports  said yellow  check manual  looks like motherboard support 
yup ‚Äô  also need purchase ac adapter separate  sure works better active powered extensions hubs 
ok well  started crackling  know steamvr could damage hardware get crackling noise since heard someone say something hardware    x200b   dont need audio app use vr 
already one  stated main post  fixed lot issues tracking  nt fix sound 
yes s connected new external usb 30 resolve lot issues headset sudden loss tracking  however  fix audio issues 
exactly  playing low volume fear  nt seem matter sound still gets loud speakers get static burst  s almost like s taunting giving finger 
chance dedicated usb 1070 plugging headset   believe nt issue  usb slot gpu upgrading 3080 believe incompatibility may ryzen motherboard wmr  testing weekend tell  get improved stability disabling msi afterburner  steamvr new nvidia drivers compatibility issues  fix issue 
interesting   worth try guess  probably unplug play 
thanks  yes actually saw rogue comment hp reverb g2 side reddit say setting helped  since also struggling headset  amd combo  sure main solution  switching settings definitely fixed 
s hard justify 60 dollar usb hub potentially get occulus quest 2 wash sell odyssey  problematic since s purchase  already purchased https  wwwamazoncomgpawdb00fpimjew  psc1  refppxpopmobbasintitle vr face cover
finally fixed  edited original post worked  im even plugged directly motherboard runs flawlessly  thanks input 
definitely software  d think headsets probably pulling different levels power usb  yet issue 
ah bummer  usb settings bios play  recommend eliminating overclocks present  usb 31 motherboard present  lastly  steamvr  developer settings  option override windows power management usb ports  definitely click  make unplug plug vr headset  steps took outside usb settings bios  tweaked one thing time like normal scientist  would exact solution  unfortunately  took shotgun approach changed things 
youtube videos show quest 2 versus samsung versus reverb 2 really researched dumping samsung well quest 2 near constant failures wmr  increased resolution quest 2 seems watered cheap components otherwise  plus even go lowest memory version apparently need buy  100 worth fit hardware make actually usable human head  hear modeled zuck s headlike appendage   display nt look good controller tracking nt seem incremental upgrade  ca nt remember reasons quest 2 eventually lost appeal simple choice  ultimately decided quest 2 would upgraded terms ecosystem nt commit suicide every patch  enough drawbacks hardware make think would miss samsung end  checked see audio driver headset indicating problem  headset would lose audio indicate driver issue seemed fixed reinstalling windows mixed reality  fix lasted day  running pciedirectly powered usb card hub always worked fine  using motherboard nt work  hub even worked janky string extension cables  could 12 volt rail maxed  voltages sitting around plenty margin  ran 2080 ti 750 evga psu never issue  also ran way many big fans way many things plugged every usb slot   times disable every audio device get one wanted used  windows bad understanding peripheral devices want use   ve never heard idea downgrading quality headset s audio device  wonder would fixed  lastly  tried moving around headphones adjacent flexibles see potential continuity issue like old pair headphones  good luck  s probably software issue s windows mixed reality issue 
classed year products  feels hot right get long imho
1000 watt gold evga psu  works fine anything else outside steamvrwmr
yep bios set auto instead gen2  gen 2 forces s max bandwidth  may missing link

new external usb 30 hub powered 
nah 1070 nt built usb  use pluggable 7 port hub working great  tried updating bios chipset drivers maybe help  idk s frustrating 
hey curiosity try usb ports card linked  reading amazon reviews one talks ports true 30  might worth look 
honestly  s fixed makes really happy came back updated rest world  struggle assuredly     x200b  behalf  thank

cause everything else works fine  nt mean whole package flawless  least experience  anywho  static explosion occur every rear io usb 30 port  hmd work every applicable usb port available back  judging posts id wager s probably hardware issue somewhere perhaps something specific recentish pc upgrades  random thing  u could try reverting motherboard default values  maybe checktroubleshoot usb ports via something like usbtreeview  whether ports hitting advertised speeds  aand something quick help troubleshoot usb issues  https  forumssharpcapcoukviewtopicphp  t349   https  forumssharpcapcoukviewtopicphp  t349  kinda random thing  ive recently started playing quest 2 certain games s big difference visually coming odyssey  cost quest 2  assume additional accessories  u could instead investigate options could result  wireless  odyssey  basically something could run virtual desktop ie  laptop backpack  id imagine aspects d pain ass  token d something special 
naughty bot 
bad bot
basically change settings bios 
yeah  s crazy though usbs motherboard  nt work  usbs new usb card purchased  nt work   everyone making cheap usb softwareheadset s job 
yes powered directly psu
frustrating  changed settings bios steamvr  settings listed original post edited update  ve zero issues weekend even able set supersampling 200  still maintained stability  m going say s fixed  yet  going give another day use  crashing loud static two days  case  s definitely usb issue potentially amd motherboard settings wmr  least case  even able plug motherboards 31 port without hiccup 5 hours playing  fingers crossed 
hmm  interesting tried 2  ll play  good find  thank 
also couple reviews power delivery issues 
solve many things via people troubleshooting reddit  figured would pay forward others 
hate say fix issue  even fix  another waiting next time promise kids play vr  m order index  want spend whole bunch money something already hand  wmr stuff disappointed kids last time  least valve cares customers takes reputation seriously  ve huge advocate wmr since beginning  lot people around wrm sets result  nt go quest 2 tracking marginally improved  visuals potentially barely lateral despite higher resolution  headset requires investment wear comfortably  want encourage facebook choke chain hardware bought  concerns optics quality terms size sweet spot ability actually adjust ipd like used high quality optics samsung  people reporting s way adjust headset clear limited optics  money quest 2 hard argue optics work particular geometry  getting index country easier  d writing goodbye email wmr community sooner 
yeah m going update new bios reset settings default tonight motherboard came new bios probably go support bar nvidia  ll give one last go  could buy quest 2 save time troubleshooting  baby way couple months vr time limited spent trouble shooting instead playing   mention quest 2 visual difference significant  mean significantly worse odyssey better  efforts nt work today tomorrow m going purchase quest 2

‚Äô correct
m expert  motherboard usb ports supply much power unfortunately often inadequate microsoft intended  guess motherboard specs designed vr mind  understandably   sucks many hurdles  vr certainly janky  s also exciting cutting edge  someone makes entirely accessible boiler plate  ll see mass adoption  facebook removing pc equation  honestly  want g2 quest 2  upgrade nt seem substantial enough acer hmd  q2 looks user friendly developed though  hope continue enjoy vr content

resolved issue steps edited original post  nt get new headset thankfully 
aw yeah hell dude hfhf tc o
three years coating audio cable dell visor disintegrating
""
cover electrical tape mate 
odd  part visor sort discoloration also audio cable
also experienced  strange  wrapped electrical tape golden
nt noticed mine gone strange green  orange colours way starting crack 
suppose re going tell us brown gunk also poor manufacturing quality  nt take care stuff 
ended replacing mine  best tell hdmi cable split somewhere near headset causes crashes  s shame loved headset 
flex seal spray 
mine  headphones input though  must different material 
ve done well  brands  cable lasts year 
dip flex seal
2 dell visors audio cables  older one significantly worse lot plastic flaking  guess must got weird batch plastic coating  work fine otherwise 
fell   fair white electrical tape probably meant heat shrunk
get touched hair greased years  many plastics deteriorate contact oils  getting exposed heat sun another common course plastics aging prematurely  though think people take care due risk lensesscreen  could course also something wrong chemistry cable begin  rare see cable bad shape three years  though unusual electronics two three decades old 
""
ve using three years  honestly m surprised controllers held punched wall many times  excuses  cable dissolved  mean would abused audio cable somehow audio cable 
yeah use daily  beside issue works flawlessly
heat shrunk tubing would probably good method fixing tbh
never seen white electrical tape   surprised pikachu  know regular 3m black one really good nt come easily 
always made sure pin mine would nt exact thing touching skinhair mount headset wall away sun  color actually changed period time used headset audio cable affected
mine got fair bit sun exposure  could part  ve recently started storing dark
would quite stiff though
s made color s probably people think hear electrical tape
weirdo boxes set use 
nope  also printed wall mount

deluxe audio strap dell visor

bought dell visor 3d model online used design das adapter would attach properly sides curved surface  using oculus rift adapter found ebay ‚Äô fit properly snapped  still tweak bit move bit use  also top piece ‚Äô still using original set bought also designed new peice fit curve top well  im endgame major thing still ipd mod see better game     https  wwwthingiversecomthing4569522  thingiverse link ‚Äô still worked 
god need  dell head ring thing sucks  hurts time 
 strap nice 
slick  use adhesive  stick velcro kind command strips 
s screen fov 
cool  love visor  used use time got reverb g2  might consider  would cool give old headset new life  thanks sharing  üëç
wow guy love vr lot
mine breaking ‚Äô decided replace  although initially tried use cheap cloth strap first ‚Äô find comfortable got das instead  feels lot comfortable also nice headphones built  thing sucked taking headset apart basically full teardown remove wires inside halo 
used heavy duty gorilla tape  originally used regular goriilla tape pieces would snap easier  stuff works really really well doubt come easily 
one  s fine  s probably better headsets cheap headset  rock vr like nobody 
‚Äô screens nice fov pretty small anything bigger fov  got headset pretty cheap tho lot first gen headsets comes cheap nowadays think ‚Äô fine 
oh wow nt even consider wires  sounds like lot
oh  wires  complicates project beyond anything ll ever want 
still think worth  found ifixit guide thankfully teardown able get everything 
‚Äô worry ‚Äô complicated taking ‚Äô tedious takes couple steps 
could nt risk breaking vr headset  ca nt afford one re incredibly hard get country  knowledge  wires sound  nt  running front headphone plug left 
‚Äô actual hdmi part headset sound cables  basically take apart headset halo unplug route away halo  sucks visor one first gen headsets end worked 
okay  nt require soldering cutting anything s fixed  imagine cables simply routed inside plastic ring free cut open 
yeah basically cables go halo headset part  way get could cutting plastic choose take apart unplug pull  wish took pictures first time looking ifixit guide helped lot 
thanks lot  could come handy something breaks   s good knowledge  hope visor lasts long time  love little fella  m order replacement covers

dell wmr audio jank
ok m trying use lapel mic wmr headset m quirky like  seemed simple enough first  buy trs trrs micaudio splitter hook lapel oems  nt work  adapter sure  proven phone  wonder aux omtp ctia standard could nt find  m  really nt know  must succumb headset buy earbuds mic  rip kph30s two halves use  things note  headset trrs double adapted use mic worked  lapel question sony ecmcs3  m honestly trying get best bang buck using micless oems jank rig  tape together aux port headset loose af  nt proven headset mic working fine  info appreciated  even leads needing another lapel giving  edit  forgot mention lapel stereo  hindsight might much problem headphones mono mics  might double adapt kphs use mic  forgot mention original setup  lapel  oem  works stylo 4 almost certainly omtp
headsets likely ctia standard  probably ‚Äô audio circuit detect switch ground mic ringsleeve like many laptops engineer  pair sony ericsson earbuds worked fine xperia phone one laptops work wmr headset computerslaptops  headset  hold control button would give stereo audio  released mono  think generally control buttons short ground send signal device  wife ‚Äô apple earbuds work  though noticed incoming mic volume extraordinarily quiet really boost within windows  use turtle beach gaming type headset  short lead meant console comtrollers  got goodwill  2 works great  would nice smaller form factor earbuds though mic picks well enough eliminates background noise  apple earbuds wife gave picked everything microphone  sorta related ‚Äî ‚Äô get ctia became standard omtp  ground sleeve makes sense

similar issue especially static electricity  best way found fixing fiddle connection worked  nt work good pair wireless headphonesearbuds might best route go 
use logitech g933 wireless headphones  wireless bluetooth interfere bit motion controls  makes jittery  wireless headphones nt add lot interference wireless keyboard mouse interfere lot  general rule supposed use wireless devices using wmr avoid controller tracking interference  devices worse others  d recommend wireless wifi headphones opposed bluetooth headphones since motion controllers also bluetooth  nt really used bluetooth headphones wmr like pointed  mic sounds like trash pc  sounds fine paired phone though   personally d recommend logitech g933 g935  933 935 current version headset

mando ps4 aparece como dispositivo de audio en pc
hola  al conectar m√≠ mando de ps4 en la pc aparece que es un dispositivo de audio un control  antes usaba el ds4 para eso pero anda muy mal ya lo reconoce  si alguien sabe alguna manera de que por lo menos el mando windows lo detecte como dispositivo de audio lo detecte como joystick se lo agradecer√≠a
entras dispositivos de sonido lo deshabilitas  despues en steam abris el big picture ya te lo tendr√≠a que reconocer como mando 
lo que decis est√° dif√≠cil  porque lo quieras  es un dispositivo de audio  est√°s usando w10 relativamente actualizado  si es as√≠  la m√°quina te lo deber√≠a reconocer como mando sea por usb bluetooth 
tengo el mismo problema hoy dia  lo lograstes solucionar   probe de todo ya 
ayuda ayer estaba chill de la nada deja de funcionar el joystick onda anda en steam todo menos en el fornait xd entonces hago un procedimiento ahora tampoco escucho de mis auris ya hice todo lo que dicen nada funciona
hola  alguien lo ha solucionado  si es asi denme todas las soluciones posibles porfavor  llevo meses con este problema es muy frustrante tener que lidiar con esto  una mierda 
lo intente pero solo  reconoce  el mando en el coso de dispositivos de bluetooth  pero en todo lo dem√°s aparece
hola c√≥mo va  mira si lo solucione  ten√©s que entrar dispositivos conectados desde el panel de control ah√≠ te van aparecer todo lo conectado  luego le das click derecho desinstalar lo que diga wireless controller lo volves conectar te lo detecta todo de nuevo  con eso calculo que ya te andar√≠a
lo que hice yo para solucionarlo es  ir  administrador de dispositivos  encontrar tu wireless controller  que podr√≠a encontrarse en los dispositivos de audio como en mi caso en las entradas usb  en cuanto lo encentres le das actualizar controlador  luego buscar controladores en mi equipo elegir en una lista de controladores disponibles en el equipo  ahora solo debes seleccionar  dispositivo de entrada usb  en vez de  wireless controller   solo queda desconectar tu mando volver conectarlo  espero que te sirva 
conectalo con usb primero  despues de configurarlo fijate si lo podes conectar por bluetooth
que genio  muchas gracias
que tal bro  como dices mi wireless est√° en las entradas usb  est√° en las de audio al estar ah√≠ puedo elegir  dispositivo de entrada usb   alguna soluci√≥n   gracias
consulta sobre pistas de audio en obs
buenas  antes que nada ya se que existe un subreddit dedicado al obs pero est√° en ingl√©s la verdad soy una poronga formulando preguntas en ingl√©s  lo entiendo la perfecci√≥n pero cuando tengo que escribir cuesta una banda   yo uso el obs para grabar videos de jueguitos mientras juego escucho m√∫sica  que quiero que se escuche en la grabaci√≥n  hay alguna forma de hacer que el obs solo capture el audio del juego  todos los tutoriales que encontr√© hablan sobre separar el audio del juego al del mic pero es lo que necesito   desde ya muchas gracias  3
entre virtual audio cable eartrumpet ya podes hacer muchas combinaciones controlar de bastante mejor manera el sonido  con eso deberia ser suficiente para lo que vos decis e incluso para tener un mayor control facilidad para el sonido  ya otra idea seria usar tambien voicemeeter  que te da una mezcladora de las entradas salidas de audio de ahi podrias combinaciones gestionar el sonido tambien  aunque te reconozco que este programa todavia ni lo us√© desde que lo instal√© aun lo entiendo muy bien   en fin con la primera opcion deberia servirte apenas la googlees vas poder ver entender como funciona de facil  suerte con eso  espero que te sirva se te haga sencillo 
medio tarde  pero si averiguaste como  podr√≠as explicarme  porque quisiera transmitir grabar sin que se escuche soy medio est√∫pido tocando todo lo que es audio siempre mand√≥ cagada
el voicemeeter lo uso nom√°s para mejorar el audio del mic  prob√© otras configuraciones  voy probar los otros 2 que dec√≠s  gracias  3
denada  suerte entonces

ojo que lo que dice el post es que puede ver el equalizador  es lo mismo el equalizador que el realtek audio control  con los drivers uad suele venir el equalizador para la salida analogica  si lo ves en la digital   depende del tipo de codec que tenga el chip de audio  con mi tuf gaming x570plus  wifi   viene equalizador grafico en la salida analogica del rac  unica forma de solucionarlo fue con equalizerapo64121 peace eq  es feo pero tiene bocha mas de opciones configurables que el eq que solia venir con realtek  drivers uad   en este foro estan las versiones uad de acuerdo cada chipsetmotherboard  https  rogasuscomforumshowthreadphp  117596driversrealtekaudio  mbintel2xx3xx4xx5xxampamd3xx4xx5xx

conversor hdmi vga  audio horrible con est√°tica
hola  compr√© este conversor para la pc  cuando conecto los parlantes sale un audio bajo con much√≠sima est√°tica  alguien sabe como puedo solucionar esto 
saca el audio por la placa de sonido listo  el dac de los conversores es una porqueria
es un conversor activo  te fijaste si la fuente est√° bien  es la que ven√≠a 
parece ser la √∫nica soluci√≥n  gracias 
es uno activo  como fuente vino un cable usb us√© un cargador com√∫n para la alimentaci√≥n  pienso que eso tiene que ver  en un momento use la misma pc para darle corriente hacia much√≠sima m√°s est√°tica
entonces proba con otro cargador
placa de audio pci con conexi√≥n frontal 
se quem√≥ el audio integrado de mi pc quer√≠a saber si viene una placa pci que adem√°s de las obvias salidas traseras viene en la placa para conectar el cable de audio que sale del frontal  desde ya gracias 
depende el mother que tengas creo te sale mas barato uno nuevo que una placa que tenga para salidas internas  casi se venden placas de sonido las que hay son muy caras son una basura en ml hay una sb1570 usada 4k que trae
la √∫nica que conozco es la soundblaster xfi titanium fatal1ty pero ya tiene sus a√±os en el mercado salen una moneda  en ml hay una usada 17k 
yo compr√© una soundblaster platinum pci que viene con un conector propietario para el panel frontal  pero 8 lucas vali√≥  que mother tenes  por ah√≠ te convenga cambiar eao 
acuerdo el modelo  es una 1155 que soporta 3ra gen con i5 2500k  ya cuando tenga mejor econom√≠a cambio por algo m√°s actual  gracias
problemas con el audio en mi laptop 
buen d√≠a gente de reddit  mi problema con el audio se debe que cuando enciendo mi pc ocasionalmente se queda sin sonido  la soluci√≥n es desintalar el dispositivo realtek high definition reiniciar el pc  lo que sucede es que luego de este reinicio los aud√≠fonos  se escuchan sin bajos con peor calidad de audio  despu√©s de un tiempo se arreglar suenan bien  deber√≠an ser los drivers porque en otros dispositivos suena bien  son los aud√≠fonos   mi otro problemas es que luego de este reinicio el problema se soluciona el 100  vuelve fallar de nuevo qued√°ndose sin sonido tener que volver reiniciar pasa seguido 
tenes el realtek actualizado  algo que paso mi con realtek es que tengo que cambiar manualmente entre los parlantes los auriculares  instalalo de vuelta asegurate que sea eso
que windows ten√©s  fijate el modelo de tu laptop busc√° el driver de sonido que corresponde 
nose como saber si lo tengo actualizado  lo que hago es desinstalarlo al reiniciarlo se instala de nuevo solo 
tengo windows 10 amigo 
busca en la barra de b√∫squeda de windows  administrador de dispositivos   bajo la pesta√±a  dispositivos de audio  deber√≠as tener al realtek  dale click derecho actualizar controladores

 ayuda  detecta el panel trasero de audio
como dicen que les va maquinas  resulta que compre unos auris el viernes  redragon scylla  los conecto en el panel delantero doy con que funcionaba solo el lado derecho al mic lo detectaba asique se ocurre que se rompi√≥ lo conecte en el trasero paso lo mismo  apague la pc desconecte el panel delantero  para ver si as√≠ funciona bien solo el trasero nada  la placa madre es una asrock fm2a68mdg3 con codecs alc662 los drivers en la pag de asrock son los instalados en la imagen  prob√© con los √∫ltimos publicados en la pag de realtek tampoco funcionan  tengo windows 81 64bits  en algunos videos vi que en panel de control el nombre del   cuadro numero 2   es administrador de sonido realtek   hd    en el mio en el   cuadro numero 1   hay un icono como de una carpeta  alguno tiene idea de que mas puedo probar    dato importante    los auris los probe en otra pc  en una notebook en el celular funcionan 100   el monitor tiene salida de auricular aca funcionan perfecto  pero puedo conectar el microfono https  previewredditmolb1u54zer61png  width1289  formatpng  autowebp  venabled  s1051ce6832252610b72a1da0dc528017220df701
lo √∫nico que te dir√≠a es que instales windows 10 tiene sentido andar con versiones m√°s viejas  se ocurre mucho  tambi√©n proba con un linux live para probar nomas  puede ser que simplemente se rompi√≥ sea nada de software 
la ten√≠a con w10  pero pareciera que anda m√°s lenta  es viejita se caga un poco  pero unos auris deber√≠an ser problema  voy probar con linux  se hab√≠a ocurrido  quiz√°s lo m√°s probable se haya roto  seguite intentando  sino toca comprar esas placas de audio usb  gracias por molestarte en responder  un saludo
problema conexi√≥n audio de panel frontal
hola  acabo de armar la pc  pero resulta que al conectar los auriculares al jack de audio frontal  los reconoce  si los conecto en el panel trasero  los reconoce perfectamente  alguien sabe una posible soluci√≥n 
lo que suelo ver en placas de sonido realtek hd es que  si el conector del panel de audio frontal al motherboard es tipo ac97 en lugar de hdaudio  tengo que tildar una opci√≥n que dice algo as√≠ como  deshabilitar detecci√≥n de jack frontal  en el audio manager del driver  que suele aparecer en el panel de control   si  suena al conectar un auricular parlante en el jack frontal del gabinete 
que tipo de conexi√≥n tiene tu panel frontal  tampoco te reconoce las entradas usb  mi panel frontal por ejemplo tiene una conexi√≥n de 5 cables la mother solo es compatible con una de 8  como dio paja cambiarlo termin√© comprando un adaptador usb 
el usb 30 lo reconoce perfecto  las dem√°s entradas usb tambi√©n  las uso para conectar los dualshock de la ps4 perfectamente  lo √∫nico que reconoce es la entrada de jack de 35 del panel frontal

audio 71 canales hd  c√≥dec de audio realtek alc887 
hola yo tengo una mother a520m la cual tiene la placa de audio  audio 71 canales hd  c√≥dec de audio realtek alc887   bueno la cuesti√≥n es que quiero comprar unos auriculares lo mismos tienen conector jack 35  lei que si son esos conectores depende mucho el audio en que tal placa de sonido tenga mi mother  quer√≠a saber si eso es cierto ademas si se nota diferencia  este es el auricular https  articulomercadolibrecomarmla863022033auriculareshyperxcloudxxboxgarantiaoficialpcejm  matttool38087446  utmsourcegoogleshopping  utmmediumorganic hyperx cloud x
se nota la diferencia  la calidad del audio depende tanto del chip en s√≠  sino de que tan bien implementado est√© en el mother  buenos capacitores  un path separado un escudo contra emisiones ayudan que el sonido de las salidas anal√≥gicas sea bueno 
consulta nombre de dispositivo de audio
la cosa es  una boludes pero quiero saber como cambiarlo  que hace poco compre unos auris inalambricos que se conectan por un usb  para probarlos cuando llegaron los conecte la pc en el primer usb que vi para probar si andaban todo bien  cuando pase ese usb la parte de atras para ya dejarlo ahi  el nombre del dispositivo cambio altavoces 2 el nombre de los auris lo cambie otros puertos ahora dice 4 afecta en nada para usarlos pero bueno gustaria saber si hay forma q diga ningun numero este normal digamos  si alguno sabe se lo agradezco pd  ya probe ponerlo en el primero q habia probado siguio sumando numerito   x200b  https  previewreddittsg74w9csye61png  width383  formatpng  autowebp  venabled  sc20bfa738e2653b3f2a9502a12b07d56ba3e7d46
