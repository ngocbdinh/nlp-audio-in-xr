dawned apple certainly make headset compatible airpods spatial audio 
""
spatial audio “ head tracking ” audio products  vr devices already spatial audio since head already tracked 
realize ll able absolutely nothing apple vr headset right  ll  2000 business headset  ca nt game apple devices 
true  long appexperience supports  one thing apple ’ headset figured anyone else though  media consumption  none current solutions apple could simply bringing existing feature set vr  especially nail comfort weight  essentially apple tv theater environment  high res  spatial audio  share play  bonus points convince content owners bring 3d catalogue vr streaming  especially disney  
get downvoted
play video games basically every single apple device screen connects screen  play steamvr games macbook pro  vr headset ’ higher resolution valve index 
’ game facebook either see  ’ saying focus gaming seeing ’ done silicon past years ’ reckon new headsets ’ disappoint graphics wise  also use openxr ’ much stretch devs make ports game ’ sure apple ’ mind selling  apple also fitness lifestyle brand apple watch lineup ’ weird go fitness gaming  saying focus think ’ early make calls exactly plan 
realize apple ’ headset got delayed may final form ever actually exist  right 
definitely consumer product definitely games  hate apple even concede headset potential
factually incorrect  need snide tone 
anymore ’ reckon ’ due little run mister call duty gamechat  also sometimes sub people taking time downvote everyone comment section  ’ weird sometimes observe newer posts 
 play video games basically every single apple device screen connects screen   learn fucking read instead playing shitty retro games time m saying apple devices natively ca nt play games 
bullshit
 ca nt game facebook  🤦🏻‍♂️
ok would give fuck  fuck apple 
like apple pro stand consumer product 
 hate apple  bullshit 
legitimately ’ believe ’ capable setting valve index little know technology  ’ link modern game runs natively apple device  https  appsapplecomusappgenshinimpactid1517783697
developer apple platforms guarantee run native games  major factor ’ see many aaa games running mac simply gaming market aaa games apple computers  would hard justify porting game native apple frameworks like metal  similar vulkan directx 12   see  one biggest issues development different systems use different libraries  system different set operations access requires extra work make application abstract apis way port application different platforms  said  triple aaa games mac  ’ make mistake thinking triple games “ real games ”  biggest market today gaming actually mobile  https  wwwdigitaltrendscomgamingbestmacgames  amp https  wwwdataaieninsightsmobilegaming2022gamingspotlightreport
wow  clearly ’ know much technology 
yeah ’ word play  also real strong argument
seem like fun person around
 little know technology  apple nt technology bubba  know acknowledging valve index s existence  lmao bubba really linked shitty low spec mobile game try prove point 🤣 
 know statement bullshit 
s 
bubba  calling daddy 
rig 2020 intel macbook pro 13 ”  ’ connected razer chroma x egpu amd 6900xt inside thunderbolt 3 use bootcamp run windows natively  hp reverb g2 connected egpu runs flawlessly  ’ know possible knew anything technology 
’ joke since facebook ’ prior hardware releases vr stuff  ’ humorous way saying facebook ’ gaming focused company yet ’ invested heavily  mainly  gaming device  much way apple ’ gaming focused devices  however headset needs run 3d environments reason support gaming device 
sure bubba  think born 
make fucking video showing 
’ daddy little pervert  would taught absolute basics technology 
better use time would learning google 
’ prove ’ impossible ’ sure 
 little pervert  👴🏻
keep thinking technology solely apple 
cause nt shitter mac nt make claim first 
response barely coherent english  least improved last one deleted  straight unintelligible  one said apple entirety technology  straight wrong ’ possible operating systems super popular first world countries  clearly ’ know much technology  ’ say thing said vr ’ work windows 
sub full uninformed people strongly asserting incorrect things  means carry 
looks fine  said work reading skills instead shilling apple playing retro games 247  also s kinda contradictory claim know technology play shitty retro games also buying computer takes assembly ever  pc better mac within last 20 years   straight wrong s possible operating systems popular 1st world countries  m right  apple devices cant play games   clearly nt know much technology  ya see bubba  right s m talking  think apple sole proprietor technology  s apple technology nt give fuck  s useless 
mac ’ even main vr machine  headset attached macbook higher resolution primary vr headset  ’ embarrassing  feel sorry 
feel sorry apple shill 
lmfaooooo
apple already device capable full color pass ar vr  equipped lidar sensor m1 chip plus neat tricks like hand tracking spatial audio  missing part stereoscopic rendering controls designed hmd  👀
""
wow need make small figure performance stereo rendering
know sub antiapple circlejerk  ’ personally excited apple ’ headset  think nail 
know apple looking get market market profitable  otherwise would nt jump bandwagon 
believe performance clip woman  ceiling one faked sure though illustrate tech  indicative real performance guess  m powerful players vr ll believe see product  s lots pieces get right far ve seen nothing pure speculation  ar kit stuff ipad equal good vr experience  s small piece puzzle
rumored headset ’ sound unlikely considering already built  ’ noses time  people ’ even know arkit fully capable making vr experiences ar app exactly vrvana apple acquired 
achieve literally phone
need games 
challenge ar isnt passthrough hand tracking much occlusion transparency  ’ much difficult make ar objects appear opaque render frame push display  basically ’ saying concept created  need rrestofthefuckingowl
could invent amazing thing ve ever seen d never buy ecosystem 
ll coming back 4 5 years buying apple vr headset
s also performance depthaware mapping rendering  two hard bits  performance  tolerate lot latency flat screen  vr 20ms motionphotons cap  ar latency ceiling even tighter compete direct realworld interaction  viewthrough devices re racing actual photons real world  mediated reality displays still compete physical interactions manual manipulation  picking visible object  otherwise still 20ms ceiling  depth aware mapping rendering even harder one  single 2d viewport ipadiphone  depth nearly ignored  rendering overlay wall needs know shape wall  squashed poly  mask objects wall  solid colour within poly  rough guess z distances sufficient convincing perspective  slap masked render captured image re good go  nt come even  close  cutting vrar  compare passthrough quest rift  depth aware reprojected  vive  nonreprojected  see scale problem  2d ar  style rendering like around long apple released arkit   s example decade ago   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vcnu4clufocw  
 missing part releasing product nonshit app locked hardware device nobody buy said app locked bullshit 
oh yeah also need add possibility compile application ios ipados without needing macos device 
apps showcased  thanks
hope foldable ipad  fold half  fold around face vr headset 
ve never used apple s ar stuff end video see girl ipad time  latency seems way high ar vr headset  might easily fixable apple though  maybe s nt prioritize latency choosing screen something 
m  impressed  ve stuff like since first consumer headsets came  let know drop something interesting 
lidar could useful fast accurate tracking  gon na need quadruple resolution  double frame rate quarter latency mvp apple s price point though  mention weight reduction much bigger battery 
really thought give us finger third energy beam 
really expecting flip us final pose
stuff need run stable 90 fps 5 ms latency 10 times smaller cooler space  10 times smaller battery vr os running 247  stable clock run multiple sensors vr bacround run human scale temperatures last least 1h gl apple  fb spend billions make work
really hope rumors true oled micro displays pancake lenses  push technology standard across industry

pretty good product think  concern tbh price especially gaming  want give game devs enough motivation support headset  far apple ’ support openxr bad news  ’ gaming similar gaming macs 
apple tends take long time release products  time  deliver promised
ca nt wait second gen nails  first gen probably overly walled garden thing expensive dev  even accounting hmd   nt right userbase spending  30 games  s unlikely pcvr  s going good mobile device  m less enthusiastic 
course nail much cost  m sure big tech company make powerful standalone headset put powerful chip  cost 1200  nt see goal
encourage competition everyone 
hardwarewise probably  m curious see much ll pretend vr zero established ecosystems allow apple tvarcade   price really come 
apple mr digital music player  redefine levels 
project something interest apple since steve jobs ceo apple  waiting right moment tech catch whatever ideas hadhave  example first apple headset patent appeared 2008 
 believe performance clip woman  ceiling one faked sure though illustrate tech  indicative real performance guess  ’ fake  ’ tried ’ really good  apple sometimes something remove shakiness hands otherwise would appear shaky actually due ipad fixed like demo  yes  make look fake ’ holding device hands ’ really magical experience  ’ nothing like meta ’ fully cgi demos lol  lidar heavy lifting make look solid  hope every headset future comes lidar sensor  ’ know ’ useful vr ’ really nice ar mr applications  ar kit stuff ipad equal good vr experience  s small piece puzzle  gives us sneak peak apple building headset  sane person thinks apple built meant touch screen device  moment open ar app iphoneipad immediately start think would look hmd  ’ really better indicator ’ come rumors
 people ’ even know arkit fully capable making vr experiences ar app exactly vrvana apple acquired  m ar vr developer  watched video linked still nt know arkit fully capable making vr experiences ar app   hint  s s anything resembling vr  also strongly resent implication arkit current implementations actual augmented reality  s far akin realtime aftereffects  cool universe real ar  look forward seeing apple pushes high water mark xr coming headset though 
’ think games intended purpose
specific  arkit already supports occlusion   example   https  youtubedcagvn276k  transparency ’ issue pass ar complete control pixel user sees  whether ’ virtual object real life  arkit display opaque transparent materials  think transparency problem see ar apple trying first headset ’ referring
 every time use apple product ends common feature working without ability fix
’ true  many people ’ buy reason sell around 200 million iphones every “ shit app locked hardware ” ’ think matters much us sub believe
likely never happen  unfortunately
sounds like something want instead something need   iphones ipads cumbersome devices serious amount codingdeveloping
first one “ sky guide ” second app rather demo devs showcase apps
yeah  make cool enough nt fry eyeballs
 deleted 
’ support webxr though 
supporting openxr huge  ’ support unity unreal  like games iphone  ipad mac desktop  ’ take much port hardware platforms  ’ come big user base  percentage user base gaming oriented 
far m aware  ve promised nothing yet
would call  1200 cheap  expect headset like  23k
steve odd  even patent idea would nt without ground stand  make tech bilionaires geniuses  people took time make decision even dreamed  lept like tech start ups majority would fail 
download app “ clips ” apple pretty crazy realtime ar effects  one replace floor disco floor  another confetti actually recognizes falls difference surfaces like tables floors etc 
rephrase  think simulated steadiness perfect performance  m aware s good reality
ok  clarity  move around  asking sure looks like s mounted  first tripod  stationary  
 m ar vr developer  watched video linked still nt know arkit fully capable making vr experiences ar app   hint  s s anything resembling vr  ’ video linked ’ show type arvr apps ’ talking  many apps appstore course simple limited due fact touch screen controls good ar vr   ’ example   mission mars   https  appsapplecomusappmissiontomarsarid1550116275   ar mode let ’ place rovers real environment vr mode opens portal teleports mars  quite simple effective   also strongly resent implication arkit current implementations actual augmented reality  s far akin realtime aftereffects  cool universe real ar  ’ real pass ar unless ’ consider “ real ” ar either 
bro  going buy hmd runs apple apps 
yea like gaming mac computers  ddd
’ already happening  code  limited  swift apps ipad run directly
able compile device  would make developping games app easier example unity  ar field apple need used  windows linux user able compile ar app iphone ipad would open new ideas  new people explore exploit full potential ar   want see ar capabilities devices used full potential 
 deleted 
s  nongaming vr applications weak hell right usually fancy ways multitasking worse computer 
’ primarily gaming long ’ robust enough allow 3rd party game devs bring games  would depend computability market share 
fingers crossed  ’ even hope openxr
 percentage user base gaming oriented  good point  ’ curious apple try market
rumors ’ working pair ar glasses  vr headsets couple years  think close decade  apparently ’ announce within next 23 years  nothing promised yet fingers crossed
imagine end goal get  400  600 range  though would make sense first gen   2000 
tech start ups nowadays almost attract attention big companies get acquired  take look oculus  pushed consumer vr 2012 got acquired facebook 2 years later
’ simulation  take video  screen recording  put fixed template  ’ different putting mockups appstore  get exactly see 
 many apps appstore course simple limited due fact touch screen controls good ar vr  yeah   touchscreen mutually exclusive feature ar vr device    ’ example  mission mars  ar mode let ’ place rovers real environment vr mode opens portal teleports mars  quite simple effective  s iphoneipad ar  application allows look 360 photosvideos like photosphere  nothing related vr whatsoever  3d rendering vr  mode  unless stereoscopic rendering headmounted display s still definitely vr way   ’ real pass ar unless ’ consider “ real ” ar either  think clearly either experienced real ar vr  re trolling  smartphone ar take headeye position account  stereoscopic rendering critical xr experience  input methods 6dof controllers hand tracking arguably bigger deal hmd  please nt pollute concept xr public consciousness garbage  know far many people tried cardboard  imagined pinnacle vr subsequently dismissed entire concept 
’ mean ’ iphone apps apple ’ appstore billion people like  really ’ matter long devs port apps games appstore
people ’ buy macs play games
sure  ll able use ipados  macos  m guessing op meant something s apple os  eg windows linux machine
oh mean make apps idevices windows linux without need mac  thought meant wanted make apps iphone iphone haha  see point agree
yeah brand new m1 macbook pro gets pretty darn warm using logic  idk use m pretty sure re either thermal throttled anything taxing
laptop huge heat sink tho cooling  ’ headset apple opted fan design reportedly still facing issues overheating 
ar porn course 
openxr nice convenience long unity unreal support sdk provide easy input wrapper ’ really matter 
matter many peoples use vr games vr need use game engine apple support vulkan dx  metal metal shitshow 3d apps  trying support   apple vr  layer running  super hard open xr basically input layer  yes apple support sad huge problem
lmao fucking mind think going cheaper iphone mass produce millions  going cost macbook easily due complex engineering 
oculus far startup  large back john carmack worked 
point post say ar vr iphone equal arvr actual headset  personally ’ think equal even tho companies try make us think  remember google cardboard daydream samsung gearvr   point post show people building blocks apple may leverage use proper arvr headset  ’ quite naive think would invest much resources arkit related technologies touch screen devices without planing cross good chunk headset  ’ reason believe core user experience would different  irrelevant end users  get technicy want  user cares delivered vs ’ delivered 
 s iphoneipad ar  application allows look 360 photosvideos like photosphere  nothing related vr whatsoever  completely wrong  ’ 360 image video ’ entirely 3d environment 6dof  literally walk inside get look whatever object whatever perspective unlike 360 videos course
yeah  s phone  everyone needs phone  everyone need  get  hmd  s also  porting app  apple store  hard core apple fanboy  probably already known s money involved  often exclusivity bullshit 
oh yeah definitely would nice use machines develop apps 
yes meant  precise  make iphone apps iphone  seems like worst idea ever haha

hey  ar porn might drive innovation though
think version aim mass produce iphone accessory  processing likely done iphone leaving less hardware necessary glasses apple watch  even  first gen may well price macbook 
 point post say ar vr iphone equal arvr actual headset discussion nt whether re equal  s whether iphones ipads ar vr capabilities whatsoever  google apple damaged concept ar enormously arcore arkit google  samsung vr gearvr cardboard  re managing perpetuate even exacerbate crap saying 2d smartphone display without lenses anything somehow vr   ’ quite naive think would invest much resources arkit related technologies touch screen devices without planing cross good chunk headset  s literally half equation  sure  underlying tech comparable  like vr headsets use smartphone displays standalone headsets use smartphone socs  nt make anything smartphones relevant  consumer perspective  ar vr   ’ reason believe core user experience would different m quite sure ve never used real ar vr   user cares delivered vs ’ delivered yeah  currently  apple nt deliver real ar let alone anything remotely resembling vr  especially subreddit like  may well call self driving car virtual reality  since would actually relevant 
guess also ignored part responded possibility   ’ entirely 3d environment 6dof rendered 2d screen  pancake experience kind like original quake   literally walk inside get look whatever object whatever perspective like quake different input method 
 everyone needs phone  everyone need  get  hmd  time phones ’ needed everyone  pre iphone smartphones  almost made exclusively professionals businesses  pretty mush essential everyone  spatial computing lot potential reach every use case imaginable makes sure hmd ’ “ needed ” item decade   s also  porting app  apple store  hard core apple fanboy  probably already known s money involved  often exclusivity bullshit  ’ care happens  long content
great  try running 3d graphics stereo crazy high resolution framerate
 m using text editors s throttling  pardon attitude  coding hardly going stress system unless re actively running app   re claiming nt fan spin load  re full like stroke apple internet  m mobile dev running flutter builds stimulated physical devices followed automation kicks regularly  s technology works  take second google people use m1 macbook air python simulations re talking core temps reaching 90c

well  yes  practice  apple tends avoid lowering price specific product s previous generation  often continues selling last gen product cheaper  offers cheaper product new base product real next gen version original product  pro  version  eg  iphone x  iphone xs  iphone 11 pro   1000 iphone used normal model  re selling  800 one normal one   1000 one  pro  model  may seem trivial  practice means average price new iphones apple products sold steadily significantly decreasing past years 
 man really kind imagination  vr also rendered two 2d screens  ’ brain makes look 3d ’ point  respond since s completely clear either understand concept vr re troll 
buddy 
correct  need underspec still try get super high framerates resolutions  see much better xr2 gets

better 5x better pair koss ksc75s kind money 
get info  buy mod 
s  m seeing potential problems third party strap users  https  youtubeskikdu2x748 s conquestvrs set coming  ve revealed price astronomical m hoping bobovr finally drops set 
thought thing 
valve ear great ear amazing default  could good  shit  wo nt know try 
valve index 3 years old still  1000 
vast majority  estimated 90   quest users pcvr  pcvr suggestions matter people nt want tethered gaming pc 
vast majority quest owners nt pcvr  combine fact would increase price include integrated highspeed  lowlatency usb hub maks sense one 
valve nt invent open ear headphone  put vr headset first  hp also used g2 
lot people  100 lot good headphones  quality headphones huge effect vr  multiple pairs  200 nt even considered expensive 
speakers really break tho  like time 
cv1 originally  800 without controllers 
got idea  buying pcvr headset instead  400 stand alone headset  expectations stupid  tech 
yea never happen 
rebuff reality makes garbage though  logitech much better brand
though admit look nicer
cool nt want another thing charge 
yea  cause know great bluetooth audio works quest 
looks like pass 
else would power speakers  d even bigger  heavier  expensive needed battery charger
charging works  link cable 
charging works  link cable 
 preorder   one actually yet 
vr youtube thing  nt know big guys make much content tiny little things often  could design 3d print  diy quest speaker  10  video better things 
ya lost
s love seeing wither dry current quest content 
nt appear quality though  look like ca nt even positioned correctly 
looking store please seem plug directly usbc port passthrough elite battery head strap
bmrs passive 35mm headphones though  literally adapt 35mm passives headphones  use eq windows driver level  even phones
someone explain said
index never registered could adjust height speakers lol 
m saying based index ones  seems least little important  sound really works best ve moved pointing pretty much ears 
certainly
height crucial  sounds wrong places  looks like crappy knockoff vr ears  allow position speakers perfectly 
index placement super important

know mean ’ product difference ’ design style difference “ elite ” vs “ halo top ”  bobo one popular third party brands use “ halo top ” ’ describing  kiwi uses “ elite ” strap style  one comes quest  ’ done shifting look  least  comfortable
kind suck  elite strap nt enough padding already know break easily  kiwi design makes superior version elite strap padding back top  top face cushion vrcover set 
says  charging optional usbc link cable  superscript near  usb passthrough   afraid might charging passthrough 
called pass  ’ charging 
ahh great thanks  misread  hopefully passthrough wo nt affect transmission speed 
’ pretty much tried ended back das 
’ got ta sort amp ’ gon na quiet ear headphones
 bet going  quality  logitech shitty audio
kinds info online search porta pro quest mod… actually personally use ksc75 slightly different model koss ear phones…  basically 3d print mounts attach headband  less give exact sound original cv1 model
yeah  looking  1 wo nt work bobovr straps 2 wo nt work link cable  bought  kiwi  3 pretty expensive honestly biggest problem q2 speakers nt sound quality  s great nt find offensive  problem amount sound leakage  index  even rift  yeah people hear bit close s bad  q2  playing reasonable volume  people hear exactly m playing like 20ft away    annoying  well  let s say would nt want games like vrchat pavlov speaker mode lol ll probably use wired earbuds  hoping decent offear headphones  apparently good ones gone forever  ones etsy  😮‍💨  nt like full headphones vr bulky  hard take onoff  make get hotter
headset  500  whole kit including base stations controllers  1000  actually cheaper buying everything individually
good headsets coming pike 
hp literally patent licensed valve 
eh  preference  find built headphones good enough  would nt spend 100 dollars better ones  wo nt judge anyone would 
longer exists
well quest 2 miracle s already  say never s clearly going heading way 
works fine airpods pro
power
vive das works normal audio jack  find solution draws power usb without blocking data 
make video
bmfvr 
s vr quest  put effort designing developing good vr games would next bill gates 
look like re supposed touch ear  like index s audio  s way comfortable sounds super open  terms soundstage   pretty great 
hah  meant audio quality suppose ’ matter much ’ actually place ears well  would shame buy nice speakers  ’ always offset inch
hoping nt fuck link  passthrough  would critical design flaw imo
obviously m aware eq passive 35mm connections software  wavlet  equalizer apo  portable dacamp devices like quedelix 5k  etc    s referring  would designed conjunction fb  gaining access base os level audio stack eq   purely software correction   internal  active  circuitry performing functions independent oculus quest  sorry confusing unclear  thought redundant qualify statement  point trying make bmr s ca nt plugged headphone jack like porta pro s vive das sound like index  heavily corrected  question  even  logitech accomplishing 
bmrs heavily equalized sound like trash  s limit physics intrinsic designposition drivers  either accomplished oculus baking chorus specific eq profile quest os  logitech including rudimentary computerprocessing headphones 
""
come  nothing gets crappier vr ears  people never get tired throwing money crowdfunding campaigns 
tilt head 90 degrees still hold 
’ problem elite strap either
gah  enthusiasm tanked 
s charging passthrough
really like das foam back strap starting wear thin velcro tape around holding battery pack making worse  probably attach foam  try another method hold battery aggressive sessions ragnarock  
agree points  although nt seen confirmed link cable wo nt work fact nt saying makes worry  said works power buy link cable separate course  nt use airlink meta 
s point  everyting use  s  1000 
partnered valve  seen anyone post valve patent headphone design 
builtin audio reasonable quality  lacks real power much bass 
part   past tense   statement nexusknights trouble understanding 
well s like whip snap dragon chip throw ryzen  best hope better optimization go far 
amazing magic  quest bt hardware causes noticiable delay 
ah ’ right  ’ sad 
nt passive headphone like das logitech many companies already make quest  directed speaker  requires power usable volume  agree logitech could    allowed data passthrough  perhaps price point concern  something else mix may screwed link functionality  maybe check rebuff reality s vr ears use case  prefer logitech s design vs vr ears s one less battery worry 
aaah  nt sub talks nothing quest
yeah unsubscribe bad hype click bait  yeah bible scriptures bit turn 
’ pcvr players ’ spend money required indies become bigger remind everyone  3k vr setup better quest  also real quick refund post negative review game released early access made one dev ’ support every possible pcvr control scheme day one  index owners seem saltiest controllers ‘ special ’ pcvr gamers worst enemy 
would  moss 2 great game recently released met utter indifference supposedly 15 million quest users even dying psvr1  gaming main activity vr right  current audiences dressing furries chats chopping boxes ragdolls 
quality might step due usb c instead 35 port  way early reviewers sound centric standard paid hype makes sus
like elite strap  tho use virtual desktop 
fb  facebook  mean could use app phones small circuit  bose since forever
yes  ’ got elite strap quest 2  vive das  index  use ratchet tightening stay face extra securely better elastic strap  odyssey halo styled strap sits head differently 
index easily  need wear properly cup back lower part skull 
ok true suck cable users 
bought replacement vr cover  definitely worth
quite sure alot people like already owned lighthouse og vive nt cost  1000 upgrade index  hypothetically lighthouses could work across generations hmds theyre kinda long term investment 
side dude
well yeah nt yet  quest 2 computing power xbox one  graphics nt look level however obviously vr running atleast 1600p 72fps rendering wider area flat screen  saying closer think  m want high fidelity vr 
’ literally issues maybe fixed newer versions
honestly really dislike content
absolutely true
exactly  big game comes like skyrim hitman decree s shit wait modders  re grease monkeys gamers  fun messing around setting stuff 
yeah facebook  would add core quest os ability detect chorus  add toggle menu  applies complementary eq profile  accessory manufacturers nt given kind access  s something oculus would work  small dsp circuit built chorus option proposed  s referring  onboard processing   internal active circuitry   phone apps nt able control alter quest s direct audio  would nt work 
know made    thanks 
gotcha  still  1000 lot invested get 
lol  guess foot mouth 
arm vs x86 difficult compare speed  said bigger issue fact vr chips power limited  going difficult chips keep getting significantly smaller  ways mobile chips already near limit raw processing power 
np dude  leather replacement infinitely better original 
know actually unused thick foam one laying around  bought two cuz wanted try thicker foam… ’ cover shipping   6   dm ur interested

thinking adding pacifist mode space shooter  think   ziggy ’ cosmic adventures   watch sound  
""
small team making vr space shooter  think starfox control full cockpit  power ship killing transforming small alien called ziggy fuel   heard many think ziggy cute killed  thinking pacifist mode little alien replaced potato ziggy s harmed  would play mode  find info game   https  steampmapp1501820   https  steampmapp1501820 
pacifist potato pretty cool proposition  think powered making ziggy laugh  monsters inc style  laughing gas instead suffocation would fun way extract energy 
’ admit watching first videos  killing ziggies one thing made hesitant  yes  ’ like pacifist mode  rather ’ think mode  think built  like fuel options side side  let psychopaths kill ziggies want  give everyone access alternative right bat without turn settings play specific game 
’ brilliant  direct correlation cuteness energy density 
2 favorite things games clunky cockpit controls pacifist options  please  
good one might drained need little nap andor feed get energy back  thing damn cute replace potato 
actually first time finding put game  idea sounds awesome  killing ziggies  general game xd  anyone know full game released much ll cost 
yes definitely would prefer way play ’ require killing ziggy 
yes
love challenge strategy comes pacifism game  totally worthwhile add  perhaps make ziggy misbehave around potatoesthe ship used himitself fuel challenge players pacifist lol 
yes  want drink bottle wine slowly sloppily explore cosmos vr 
would absolutely love pacifist mode ziggy cute 
love
nonlethal option harvesting energy ziggys  like  maybe trade offs  get less energy individual ziggy  charge battery quicker  fully  harvest multiple times indefinitely cool  conveniently maybe hang air lock somewhere put recover  
pacifist mode would fun
agree others adding pacifist mode would good people nt want kill ziggy  anyways kudos hard work look forward playing future 
sorry  using cute little guy fuel source ensured playing  totally board 
played demo  different modes sound good  flying challenging though  hope gets attention release 
great option imho  probably would nt play pacifist mode  least first time playing  s great alternative 
ask  ziggy reference ziggy stardust 
d kill ziggies hotas support 6dof flight model 
mess around random objects environment   instant buy 
kill little guy  makes game harder  would compelling  end situation boost gives save life  whole game progress  decision use tough make 
nt waste time resources pacifist mode 
yeah also want even hardcore mode get ziggy cannon ship  use ziggy s projectiles splat hit
need protect ziggys 
’ wait game  ’ number one wishlisted game steam long remember  looks immersive 
cool af man keep
certainly step right direction  think ziggy still big part gameplay cycle  earlier posts  comments ve seen many suggestion could still implement ziggy without killing poor thing  potato  inanimate object  would nt quite interesting ziggy  re really going places  keep good work 
whatever reason  killing cute things video games piss people haha  source  subnautica fan great concept game though  looks fun 
look guys posted shit games bit much  point advertising stated rules  excessive advertising making sure 10  post history related advertising  100  post history exactly  game looks great please follow rules
make feed ziggy point kill make harder killing 
common potato deserve fate 
lime instead potato 
downloaded demo wouldnt run hp g2  game ive found hasnt worked  looks cool tho
make pacifist mode extra hard  perhaps require resources make potatoe  low  barely worth power output   people always option kill ziggy  test humanity 
feel like ziggy s used power instead dying lose color recharged way also love game ca nt wait try m hoping demo comes soon
hi would love pacifist mode  guys work flight controls  tried demo real rough time trying move flight stick  always felt like fighting going enough 
like dark humor would probably stick main mode  nt begrudge anyone else would nt 
think entertainment evolve beyond shootingkilling things general  give player option take path want  people burning dung source energy millennia 
gon na lie wouldnt jump game kill cute creatures constantly im soft  immersion makes insanely magnified
please  first time saw game thought  moral dilemma created needing sacrifice ziggy power ship  would love mode ziggy hangs sacrifice potato 
yes please  worked zoo kill cute rats rabbits daily reptiles eat left doozy aversion killing small animals  interested game saw regularly kill ziggy  pacifistpotato mode would perfect  big yes vote 
s game  ai nt important issues  good  d play either way 
 would play mode  potato lame  want pacifist  let print shake weight charge shaking like lunatic 
mind went first   instead finding ziggy s  one pet ziggy  create fuel throw extractor object play  toys ziggy fuel instead ziggy 
great idea  monsters inc 1010 movie  idea little boo alien disguise cuddling ziggy warm heart
sort feeling watching trailer  although honest ’ realise required action assumed dev psychopath torturing ziggy kicks   
’ glad like  working 2022 release estimated price 1999 gbp  although subject change  
thank kind words   hope enjoy game releases 
literally talking pacifist mode dont kill ziggy

’ literally exact attack animations used blade sorcery latest update  guess games used items asset store 
bit clunkier blade sorcery hellsplit actual campaign like say im excited 
name  link 
many shitty knockoffs blade sorcery going get another  real  game drops   anyone  thinks hitting skeleton  blade  fun
personally disliked  mainly clunky combat 
honestly  waiting many years ’ underwhelming 
sound work demo  ’ tomb explorer demo previously ziggy ’ demo  ’ never problem audio index vr except steamfest demos  hit rate pretty low  strange 
looks sick
unreal engine 
sound worked case helps  sound hubris demo found sending audio desktop essentially  able work around problem changing windows audio output target headset speakers 
hate vr cant participate bind 
please  write list type game  know blade sorcery popular one  gameplay looks cool nt know th e title  og quest  run games system 
thought demo ok disappointed floating hands arms though  breaks immersion compared games like hellsplit b  
yeah  looks really bizarre magic undead move way

s like first time played legendary tales could see right possibilities yes story dungeons etc  m
https  storesteampoweredcomapp819190undeadcitadel
undead citadel free demo steam
yes especially s story involved  mindless wave wave 
 s indistinguishable 2019 blade sorcery  b  advanced far beyond  especially randomly generated dungeons added  recent animation overhaul 
nt know s changed video card yesterday went 1080 ti 6900xt  found good open box deal micro center lol s much much faster 1080 ti
problem hubris demo 
unity
s usually issue  nt concerned want check gameplay
undead citadel
quest 2
definitely prefer full body ik game deep enough look past  time tell one shapes
would say compares legendary tales  far feel combat 
thanks 
thanks 
blade sorcery procedurally generated dungeons  next update  dungeons get progression system 
oh really  reason looked like unreal  developed vr games  thanks info 
pretty hard tell direction enemies coming without sound 
yes already quest tests
s close think legendary tales s little better sword play
problem  enjoy

use sound positional tracking 
say 8 directional microphones every corner room pointing towards center  well tracker emits continuous unique tone  imperceivable humans  could use programs measure volume individual tones comping individual microphones determine approximate location tracker   could calibrate standing center room get base measurement  approximate location tracker could use something like aimachine learning  conjunction vr headset ’ positional data  interpret motion trackers accurately enough  physical way limbs move predictable  long know length limbs positions joints  easy enough program determine intending walk  course see obvious hurtles standing way already  like  quickly need sample audio  loud speakers need  even though ’ hear sound volume required might damage ears  noisy environments might make hard detect individual tones  plenty  ultimately really want know  done 
probably  though instead continuous tone  d go pulses  like bats  think light might easier handle  polarization  know  like  lasers  obvious answer aside  magnetic waves well  s research paper motion capture via disturbance wifi signals  works walls  neat  could track neighbours neighbours  could problematic 
measuring distance volume nt precise enough  think  tracker muffled clothing obstructed  also s nearly impossible create speaker s evenly loud every direction  turning around would also change volume  would probably work better tracker emitted pulses sound constant rate  microphones used timing differences measure relative distance tracker microphone  little bit like gps  reverse   many problems make practical  think 
see problems solution  measuring distance sound works pretty well  thinking house building applications measuring distances  next common laser driven devices  work precision level need solid hard area repel sound waves  chirps  even better facing 90° angle reflects back perfectly  human middle vr play area whole different story  sure would able get position  maybe sort algorithm something even use  every human shaped  wearing clothes  facing emitters receivers perfect angle  na dont see  precision tracking would usable vr  light  laser  easy  travels straight line  either hits sensor  1  nt  0  audio based tracking much stuff cause interference  sound bounces surfaces room naaa  dont think gon na happen  
yes  pulses better  blipchirp wide range frequencies  earsbrain locate sounds way expected sound transformed time gets inner ear  op nt need microphones corners room 
point trackers ’ necessarily precision  needs tell whether tracker moving direction  benefit tracker ’ inexpensive  lightweight  longer battery life  though trackers chirp measure approximate distance  like said sound might get muffled obstruction  though might able use low frequency continuous tone  lower frequencies ’ get absorbed much obstruction  figured measured relative difference volume base measurements  could train program track relative position tracker ignoring measurement greatly differ average  even instances looses “ tracking ” program tracking data headset ’ attached fixed point body  like trackers  ’ actual tracking  vr programs already approximate leg movement based headsets positional data  could way supplement bit control  basically would wireless motion sensors tell relative direction motion

know still mobile chip also ’ mean low enough latency induce presence esp controllers  example rift also wired headset significantly worse latency cv1 valve index 
nt know  anything controller wise d notice  beat saber  pistol whip ect  play index 144hz anyway  real reference meaning could give  would time splits braking distances race track  m generally around split 23 racing circles  everything seems point  win lot   one reasons gave racing 45 frames g2  shooting every braking point due visuals matching precisely

s quite impressed  https  wwwredditcomrvirtualrealitycommentsxtmv0dthepico4fovisquiteimpressivegerman
sweet spot quality pico 3 quest 2 lenses  fov bigger 
coming soon   
hmm nt sound right s experience s interesting hear  honestly expecting lot pancake lenses far sweet spot size clarity goes  mean s whole new lens technology re also quite bit bigger comparison  go detail  example towards outer edge lens notice chromatic aberration image get softblur like headsets 
far outer edges orange tint  nothing worry  bottom edge quite blurry comparison edges  pancake lenses clear winner clear advantages headsets  good lensen  exciting aspheric lenses 
interesting thanks  really hoped improvements fresnel would bigger  guess s possible fresnels come long way last generation headsets gap smaller expected  really need see judge though 
yes  exactly  newer fresnel lenses good 
virtual desktop movie audio

vr audio
hello everyone  probably buy hp reverb v2 g2  one question  connect via displayport rtx3080  pc   heard motherboard  asus tuf gaming plus z690  pretty bad integrated sound card  wonder vr s sound card  use motherboard s sound card  something graphics card  ps  nt know audio really bad say  headphones use sound card
displayport acts sound card computer  accept digital audio streams variety formats embedded video signal  display device  ie  headset  conversion digital signal analog signals routed headphones  motherboard s integrated sound card involved process  graphics card wo nt create analog signals  either  virtual audio device simply embed separate digital audio created vr applications displayport cable headset 
yes  realtek usb sound card built headset takes care builtin microphones  theres two  audio output headphones  re actually speakers stay suspended near ears   re pretty high quality speakers  dont know says re bad  lower register strong  want use headphones  would nt  prefer  unscrew builtin ones 
audio carried either display connector usb  either case s digital  headset dac  sound card   audio wo nt affected motherboard s  shame g2 nt 35mm jack  though  running iems dislike stock audio pain ass since run extension
thanks  nt worry  
tweak windows sound enhancements 
ll see  ve heard s audio pretty good  thanks anyway 
well  nt know quality reverb s builtin sound device  least wo nt worry motherboard s device 
someone works audio production side gig  audiophile  people idea talking  check reviews someone knows shit  necessarily someone ton followers thousand people saying thing without able explain nt g2 ve used  audio fine like pretty much vr headset  decent set iems still worth want quality audio

audio playback device issues playing pcvr  workarounds oculus hogging audio devices 
maybe m missing something  s annoying reshuffle devices every time m playing air link  option choose specific device somewhere opposed air link hogging default audio device  s ca nt reset manually  s really annoying  instance youtube tabs open chrome ca nt reset reloading page  actually open link new page get working  work arounds  possible specify fixed audio device hidden setting somewhere  virtual desktop maybe better regard  ca nt one finding extremely annoying 
found small tool switch devices   https  soundswitchaaflalome   https  soundswitchaaflalome  wo nt fix chromeyoutube problem  least makes less painfull switch devices 
annoying  nt found means make switch back automatically  vd switch back headset goes standby  windows 10  found quickest route switching back audio device clicking speaker icon taskbar s system tray  clicking active device  little arrow   brings list  selecting main playback  ideal  3 quick clicks without need dig though settings windows control panel 
s nt know switch back  also breaks youtube course might google fault  s super inconvenient  applications manage play audio devices without breaking setup  nt think s anything sloppy coding  oculus probably issues getting work endless different setups eventually decided hog audio device let user deal fallout since pcvr meta priority  likely never come fix 
nt issue needing reload videos  youtube  etc  odd  curious driver compatibility issue  link cables nt like asmdedia usb drivers  example  love vr  fair share software rage last couple days

hello  3d bluray movies would like watch vr  research see bunch stuff encoding sbs ou really cuts resolution  also every vr player treats files display differently  players play 3d bluray file natively full 1080 per eye without screw anything  basically im looking whatever way takes least amount work get makemkv vr displayed correctly 
 native 3d  bluray requires active passive 3d glasses  vr headset  method generally either active shutter  quickly alternating image eyes  polarization  restricting light eye give depth perception  though players also support methods make choice viewing tv  options vr stated  redgreen shift  300 3d blurays ripped plex server watch g2 q2  1080p mp4 sbs  better tv 3d theater  brighter nt tinted glasses  large screen close makes lot 3d effects pop much better  issue resolution  going good headsets video kind  pixel density factors come play limited current state technology  g2 much clearer brighter q2  however  pretty good  edit  player important  bigscreen free  limited theater environments limited picture quality controls  pigasus skybox well worth purchase price imo due extras controls get  3 depending watch use either pigasus skybox 
use mpchc madvr play video files mvc stream  second image  sbs use bigscreen watch vr 3d
linux  cheap janky budget solution displaying 3d video use bino hmd extended mode  change settings match whatever 3d format video setting leftright sidebyside  move middle hmd screen scale stereoscopy matches  could really use better solution though  might make one point 
nope  activate whole sbs crap
ah  ok makes sense  thanks informative reply  anyway get skybox pigasus steamvr  use vive looks like skybox stopped sold ago pigasus isnt listed  way get 1080 per eye sbs  regular sbs looked fine headsets get better time would like future proof basically reencode everything 
sounds interesting  ill look 
encode mp4 3840x1080 sbs  full 1920x1080 per eye  play dedicated player like whirligig deovr  nt tried skybox imagine well  bigscreen really option mirror desktop since nt 4k monitor  ca nt get full pixels way 
steam skybox  aware available anymore  pigasus quest  viveport steam video player 3d  virtual desktop steam app  least  play video player remote desktop set vd sbs  use video player desktop show sbs image switch vd sbs mode  use dvdfab backup discs  1080p per eye would 3840x1080 resolution pretty sure unless possibly ripped 4k using ai enhance  would upscaled native 1080p disc   someone else may better info  edit  bigscreen appears still available steam

afford thing fine getting bluetooth headset 
used vive use audiotechnica athm50x headphones audiotechnica atgm2 midmic  gives highquality audio fantastic blocking even loud fans air filters  hmds  prefer use reusable audio solution builtin one must upgraded headset 
try audeze isine 1020  cheapish  lcdi34  exp  bluetooth 50 module  different leagues terms sound quality 
get headset mic  use jabra 80  full sizeover ear  fits easily 
nt bluetooth headsets loose significant quality headphones mic used time 
yea  common problem bone conducting  earphones   also bluetooth already looses quality stability s nature  least windows   especially listen speak time  wired maybe wifi options better way go game audio 
definitely get point writing  know good solution could buy  else would  basically saying  s ok companies sell expensive stuff working cause people buy stuff make work   people  trying  make complaint  try   maybe double check posts press submit 
bluetooth headsets tend bad audio quality windows used gaming  quality extremely low listen speak time  even speak listen  connection sometimes drops quality introduces noise  bluetooth option nice game audio  better go wifi wired 
plug cable connects microphone boom replace short one audiotechnica atgm2 modmic  know brand  cause would perfect varjo  35mm headphone jack cm away unnecessary long cables headset could avoided  seen antlion modmic v5 could  called modular  current lineup microphons 
dont use bluetooth home  mostly m  ca nt really say  however good quality paid earbuds  nt noticed anything like mentioned  used actual pair headphones  would think loss quality would even less apparent due extra power hardware  course  buy  20 pair  air pods   nt think re going good experience  much like  5 pair wired earbuds  buy quality reputable product  dont think issues long meet requirements  anc  works pc  good mic  etc

 plug cable connects microphone boom replace short one audiotechnica atgm2 modmic   actually  fact cable least favourite thing mic  originally bought replace zallman modmic failed due bad cable 3 years one  exact cable thickness  despite  10x price   course  removeable  extremely disappointing given originally bought last longer  find something quality removeable cable currently available today  please let know  although mic excellent sound quality superb noise isolation  worry fail eventually    ve 1 2 years  usually leave plugged pc along headphones  cable length reduced big concern  even using phone  s bit awkward works fine   suspiciously flimsyseeming nonreplaceable cable definitely  definitely recommend works well vr fantastic sound quality even lots background noise  need short longlasting cable  recommend perfect microphone yet found 
potentially thing windows  none 6 bluetooth headsets  true wireless buds   managed sound like terrible phone call mic use  bluetooth signal bottleneck sound quality falls cliff matter good sounds 
dude slight visual upgrade  pretty major  good g2 
indeed loose much quality listen speak time  least windows  cause tried  tried soundcore life p3 80  cause brother spare set gave testing  even listen  clearly hear artefacts occasional quality lost  option nice game audio  think wifi wireless headsets better option regarding quality stability would go wireless  would much rather preferer use 35mm audio jack varjo

kiwi design done  ve recently using onear audio head strap kiwi wanted share experience far  ve used many vr accessories throughout past years kiwi products never fail impress  specific product impressive  comfort counterweight headstrap provides excellent sturdy feeling  coming music production background used quite bit different pairs headphones throughout years  firmly say headphones provide high quality sound experience  headphones also provide noise isolation really nice live noisy environment  would also like mention headphones soft comfortable  worry ears sweating irritating long sessions  highly recommend product anyone looking comfortable headstrap built headphones

kiwi ones lock open position like das 
audio connected 
quest 2 connected pc via link cable  enter oculus link  reason audio coming headset  instead comes computer monitor  check oculus app  says headset connected “ audio headset ”  whats going 
 oculus audio output  something like sound device needs use windows  think setting oculus app specify audio device switch link activated  ca nt remember outside headset headset though  otherwise manually switch windows audio settings 
good suggestion  however oculus virtual audio device show anywhere audio settings  nowhere found  check app things device seen anywhere windows settings  probably also specify windows 11 
s possible never created windows 11 differently  one thing note windows 10 hides disabled audio devices default might want check  show disabled devices  toggle

""
swapped earpieces got side lacking audio  think cable inside strap torn 
cable tuning ic  problem cv1 literal hmdend connector  microchroma  manufactured single company  spectra7  discontinued manufacture  microchroma intended avspecific  vrspecific  compact connector used multiple manufacturers  oculus ended implementing  rift switched oculinksff8611 cots connector originally designed high data rate pcie  available multiple manufacturers 
planned obsolescence  also never trust oculus product  shady af
ca nt chargeback purchased paypal  filed 3 disputes keep closing  latest one says delivered  apparently oculus told paypal purchased service  goods lol  reported nothing come  genuinely explored every available option think aside taking court 
fuck charge back report 
yep  love play vr quest 2 basically needed reasonable price  ’ worry super mad would loved buy another brand time price option 
absolutely  fml  apologies 
cable straighten since nt bends  s gradual process s big deal 
goes luck next four years lol
yes  took 2 weeks total  kept old cable still works  asked earphones headset back
worked perfectly  thanks 
good point 👌
spent time chat explaining issue  traded emails serial purchase date  got email saying send hmd replace  wow
s former actually  op stated europe another post  force corporations supply replacement parts decent amount time sell product  unlike good ole late stage capitalism us  got lucky 
m complete opposite  never touch oculus exclusive never even considered looking oculus store replaced rifts last year hassle 
yes 😂
yeah issue response  means spare new cable headphones  made point keep original cable sending back even nt separate spares cables  fix audio issue consume rights good europe s design flaw orginal design reasonable wear tear 
ah  nt intention  merely trying say kindness never bad  heard multiple instances support robots  sorry came wrong 
think op meant receipt
happens us 
lets hope one lasts long
glad hear 
surprised tbh  5 year old one holding alright  baby though  man must logged 1k hours least  probably  fragile points still think pretty good durability things considered  thing mine cord bumps  audio fine  visuals solid  look tape trick audio nt break  congrats though  s awesome 
really speaks lot meta thinks customer instead going beyond absolute bare minimum legal requirements vary region region 
send back headset cable broken  still works wires exposed spots  ’ covered tape headset controllers acting  cable issue still 
yea support people ve spoken kinda apparent learned english customer support  tried thank using slight advanced language thanks  sometimes agents nt understand  kinda sad goes show nt get lot appreciation 
bone apple tea
mailed today  fingers crossed
s m saying consider damage cable wear tear  internal cable headset causes audio issue design flaw replace headset happens come spear headset cable  sadly cable connects headset breaks real option expensive replacement ebay 
lmfao
maybe email ask sell spare cable  tried like 2 years ago  would nt even consider even paid  m cool   want spare incase break  bumps scaring hate baby 
heard company made cables went bust ip ca nt resourced hence able get new ones  managed get one guy amazon marketplace  brand new  lucky 
try chat  relatively quick back forth get past lot stupid questions lot faster email  yes  judging experience  op s  try  maybe save replace bad ones  sell spares

 virtual reality  s pretending child  connotations rolling floor
know ’ lot serious stuff  talk ’ using wrist straps end…
“ jessie ’ avatar assaulted ” almost feels like parody lmao
still think s anoying people say  uh metaverse  show vrchat 
problem vrchat meant 13  exclusively children  ways block report people  nt stop people first place  worlds made community vrchat  s way really 100  regulate uploaded shown people  additionally would hard find worlds since re generally lowly populated meaning people would need go searching specifically  fact s still proves people nt care report  goes avatars well  clearly people nt care report s used public instances often one time probably guy nt care got hold friend someone cloning  honestly hate news covers stuff like  expect internet 100  safe kids even though s super easy find 18 content simple google search  hell accidentally stumbled onto website 6  14 years ago 
hate  dont wear straps good  didnt even tighten like whyyyy
meta blame  parents 100  blame 
see vr new evil corrupting children putting risk predators  s like children 1st world countries small pocket able computer always connected internet goes relatively unmonitored parents  oh wait  course went straight vr chat darkest corners  imagine went something mellow like altspace something instead  would nt made interesting news report suppose  also  pretending child  thing bugged many levels  ca nt honestly say ve positive experience vr chat yet hate throwing bus 
wait minute  clubs age restricted rooms  journalist playing literally go settings  turn age restrictions nsfw filter search clubs suppressed vrchat filter displays first rooms see play tab  child exact thing  btw  s games fault  s child parent s fault child clearly learnt things experienced somewhere else  tik tok  snapchat instagram  
wtf club ruby
s like bbc went explicitly wanting hint s child pornography freeforall  screw modern journalism 
forget metaverse  s walkabout miniverse   vrisforminigolf
think lot 18 vrchatters tend really good blocking children soon ve talked mic  usually super memey  obnoxious avatars re really easy point block  think best thing hide  visitor  rank safety settings outright  filters kids screeching new quest 2s filters cooler people  new user  rank nt really missing talking people actually enjoy stick around game since s time gated 
feels like parody
sub stop caring everything vr lumped  metaverse   metaverse irrelevant term 
fuck media  would blame violence caused games  😂 news media needs abolished real plague society 
yooo 1 news  fellow kiwi
re looking bad shit
npc clown world 🤡this cant real
vrchat running standalone high framerate  totally fake 
let ’ wait till talk vr making people want kill others
m 100  certain exact story written aol chatrooms 20 years ago  fucking tired bullshit journalism 
good  widespread adoption pave wave corporate takeovers 
basically issues know…the entire internet 
easy seek toxic people know look  strips club vr  good spot vr  could teach kids interact situation  best situation uncomfortable leave  vr app unhinged place  anything goes time  worse social app start  rem room better kids 
ve never played vr chat  genuinely kind thing stumble across without warning regular  like seem suggesting  journalist actively searching inappropriate content disgusted found 
s  vrchat
degenerates exclusive vr  find online general
fucking hilarious ’ sorry just… leave  😭😭 hit block button  nothing new  sort shit around since habbo hotel😭 “ safe kids ”  well… ’ kids  albeit  issue actual harassment stuff safe 13 year olds reality ’ age restrict human interaction  ’ parents ’ responsibility make sure ’ interacting safe people imo 
way  saw exact clip bbc news uk yesterday lunch break work  stop laughing people watching genuinely taking seriously  saying awful etc
ugh vr chat pure trash
joke  article filled lies misinformation  get life people  raped assaulted vr  weak minded sensitive take damn headset moron 
vr chat metaverse
quest 2 ’ even designed young kids  headset ’ going small neck favours  ultimately ’ parents role supervise kids  would buy headset let kid roam adult chat rooms  would let kid wander talk strangers  ’ understand vet movies watch games play  ’ instance  ’ like buying kid laptop letting roam free internet controls 
using tamaki skin vrchat  nice weeb
meta verse like vr game something
vrchat video faked  way h3ll got running smooth without lagging glitching  lol person comment wavelength 
wait hear people kill vr 
prob indirect metaverse ad
anything mean anything could lower viewership traditional media condemned media chance get  2014 media tried tell us gamers dead  happen vr  threat news empires world 
sex related things always led way new technologies  new format supports sexual content others arrive  internet  vr  robots  s companies interested realistic robots sex companies interested realistic robots service positions like waiters something  ever get robot serve us drinks  many many years ve robots sex  yeah zucc says metaverse future sexual content make think s lying haha
’ tired boomers scaremongering new technology ’ understand 
dude block child online games  like internet ’ stuff block  would even let kid play game clubs  mean says 13  mean yeah age restrictions certain worlds parents also play part monitoring child
think news story missing several key details  think agree internet communities general  especially gaming  full toxic interactions would never allowed slide reality 
god pray shit crashes burns
mean  ’ purposely entering adult section vr chat  make specific changes settings enable  reason complain  looked drama  ’ club ’ ’ gon na donkey slap mother
reads manner  local strip club pretends child  shocked things sees 
guessing jess never seen wii 
 removed 
agree  much misinformation make jab facebook  fan fb  least get facts straight
every social app vr  metaverse  fucking hate
know right  metaverse corporate buzzword  made thing s boring real life boring vr 
mean metaverse still uscanada
technically  minecraft
think something similar going roblox horror games  totally innappropriate anyone 015 age range  re planning implement age ratings games  already age verification set  hopefully lot socialite simulators like vrchat see something similar  game 13 excuse 
’ never used straps lol
buy new head strap  got awesome one amazon 
yeah  m 18  turning 18 next month  would love private rooms age restriction vrchat  social game  get access private room need prove age id  way atleast escape majority annoying people  reason like 1 hour vrchat s like social game tried  want game people like 1516 ca nt access  want able conversation without interupted someone screaming 247 
modern journalism  kind reporting old time 
imply wrongly
ayyy
yup comes massive regulations  ’ pretend ’ regulating wellbeing users tackled copyrighted character avatars  think goes bigscreen ability stream movie public  ’ still early stages somewhat free widespread adoption fearmongering media coverage know shit changing getting limited  bombarded ads 
hang around public areas  shortage screeching children furries pretending fuck front everybody 
mostly option 2 whilst ocasionally idiots inappropriate things public worlds  could said anythinganywhere   usually trolling  majority time specifically need go looking  exactly reporter 
bro 6pm nightly news 💀💀
generation time comes  grew 80 s remember pieces exactly like one 
lately people  including people sub  taking issue online interactions new problem  really dont get 
mean  horizon worlds   social vr app  s      metaverse  claimed either 
fuck let mark zucker throw dumbass  metaverse  blanket everything remotely involved vr
right  s also internet  without internet would nt interaction   internet allows children see porn  newsworthy water wet 
app  minecraft   part  metaverse  like brothel real life representation ‘ world ’  ’ part bigger picture 
technically  metaverse encompass vr   technically  metaverse apps facebook put far  vrchat part metaverse  s game available tons platforms   zero   metaverse affiliations 
spare links brudda 
club penguin vr would dope everyone  moderating voice interactions orders magnitude harder though
“ perfectly balanced things ”
experience also say seen  fucking cringe would nt want kid going anywhere near vr chat 
pretty much 2 usual screechers edgy kids crash people 
 deleted 
fact even people subreddit confusing drives insane 
absolutely  opinion  game nonregulated user generated content public voicetext chat  considered 18  given special ‘ unregulated ’ warning   would least put awareness game ’ effect kids parents make decisions articles like ’ complain though kids wandering without restrictions  plus would encourage game developers add measures profiles aged x younger voice chat disabled default enter games like  kids would chat friends via party within friends list  ’ work done  made much safer regulated space 
 metaverse  used htc advertising well  m interested see meta tries trademark  metaverse   seems little late game 
clearly little idea metaverse  s nothing new  unfortunately facebook brainwashed  s similar gamers call rtx anything rt path tracing related 
got amazon  replacement oculus quest 2 elite head strap 3in1 version  kuject detachable  adjustable headband strap  lightweight  portable oculus quest 2 accessories fit official quest 2 carrying case  nt need top strap

generally love quest 2 air link works seamlessly except one super annoyance  please stop switching audio output  absolutely reason happen streaming quest 2 understand pcvr priority meta  chose include software please right  decode audio without switching devices stop breaking enduser setup

point even touch audio device  sending stream  playing hardware  decode without switching hardware devices  hardware devices attached  s sloppy coding

specific  ca nt find anything settings related audio devices 
go devices  quest2 touch  audio  set microphone audio output 
yes found  thank  think ve misunderstood complaint  unfortunately change anything oculus behavior  oculus still switches windows audio device  forcing user manually switch back longer playing 
chance playing steam game  rather oculus rift store one  time ve ever seen behaviour describe steamvr changes audio output headset wherever changing windows default audio device rather sending sound directly  playing oculus store game oculus device windows default audio device entirely unaffected  settings steamvr similar oculus ones let define happen audiowise  experience re janky af ll often manually change windows default audio device get sound come hmd playing steamvr game  whereas oculusbought content audio works properly every time  least

locationbased audio controller 
recently  playing bit phasmophobia pavlov rather intrigued different approaches different games voice chat want know ways  regular vr player  starting game dev player want way make virtual audio source attached controller example  discord using virtual speaker virtual mic mirror  mix actual audio device attach left controller lower raise volume depending distance controller headset dev  s pretty much walkie talkie  s much less hacky much immersive  pretty much using spatial audio attached player s controllers instead directly cast audio regular headphones   x200b  imagine one wii game controller phone need move controller ear real world hear call
possible write app presents virtual audio output voip app  passes sound audio library spatialization support position  outputs headphones  steamvr lets applications access positions tracked devices  part nt difficult implement  game engines already come audio systems let spacialize audio sources way like well

good know m right track  wish vm would autocheck  meh  edit oh shit s autorestart  ll try  edit 2 nope  constantly restarts 
like additional channels  additional settingslisting apps using virt channels  look banana well thank suggestion 
worries used potato first till realized needed particular setup figured d offer incase nt know  really wish worked better tho feel like m constantly tinkering even tho get set works next time use  s changed defaults idk m switching around channels shit till works xx maybe s user error feel like nothing changes still messes somehow even past losing detection

hey guys  ve vive pro years never really run issue last weeks  reason ingame audio vastly louder  ingame voice chat volume extremely low  nt necessarily case every game  example  walk mini golf  pc sound settings sit around 50   game sound settings 100  exception music around 90   hear everything loud clear  hear everyone game perfectly voice chat  fall  pc sound settings sit around 50   ingame sound settings 50   voice chat 100   people significantly quieter game  even varying person person  vastly mess sound settings able hear anyone clearly without straining  pavlov zombies  pc sound settings sit around 50   master volume ingame 5   voice chat 100   people quiet hear anything said unless completely silent levels  zombies loud enough hurt ears melee range  even 5  master volume  someone picks upgrade like someone screaming ears  inconsistencies audio levels driving crazy  feel like spend first 15 minutes game mucking ingame sound settings try get point enjoy game  anyone experience advice getting consistent sound levels 
don´t know happening volume levels  use simple software setup volume level application  it´s name appaudioconfig nirsoft   https  wwwnirsoftnetutilsappaudioconfightml   https  wwwnirsoftnetutilsappaudioconfightml  curiosity offtopic  use vive pro headphones  og vive vp2  immediately detached phones came use sennheiser 580 hd open backed headphones  much  much  better sound ample soundstaging  nightday difference  best choice buy wireless headphones  mine wired

ca nt get surround sound receiver using psvr watch 3d films 
connect ps4 pro processing unit  pu goes receiver  normally  works fine watching 2d film playing vr game every time want watch 3d film  get audio  fix 
need use headphones  psvr converts 51 surround sound 3d audio 
m pretty sure audio works headphones
dadly stereo output playing vr mode  51 
speakers work m playing vr game 
nt think immersive sound go along immersive visuals  know nt use receiver vast majority folks nt use receiver playing games still surround sound 
s way 
fully agree  real issue hopefully fixing vr2  nt really solution turning system louder s less annoying  mean 3d audio surround soundthing people got sound system right 
correct  film 51 
get 3d audio ps4 audio output  headset 
got audio setup want connect ps4  specify s stereos also headphones driven amp  since play vr m wondering tv output also 3d audio connect headphone jack headset  thanks
 3d audio processed breakout box  sent headset audio jack 
3d sound works cabled headphones psvr  google „ binaural audio “ want understand 
oh see  nt processor box send signal tv though  3d audio sent one 
understand  m wondering specifically headphone jack headset 
’ send 3d audio tv  speakers tv fixed ’ move head headphones  sounds would coming wrong directions 
yes  specifically headphone jack vr headset  test swapping connect headphones turning head vr headset  connected headset  sounds change relation direction facing  using headphones connected way provide directional sound results  also throw brain cause motion sickness  really want use headphones attached directly vr headset  
nt make sense  view tv changing headset user turns head would weird audio nt change well match view
gotcha  thanks explanation 
imagine ’ ingame sound source right  sound going come right speakerheadphone  turn 90° face sound  headphones correctly shift right central position  tv speakers  fixed location sound would actually move physical left turned face right 
another useful info…the 3d sound ps4psvr actually calculated breakout box  ps4  hence headset works 3d sound 
headset user would weird  display tv sound intended headset user  anyone watching gameplay tv sound needs move normal 
part nt clear hdmi goes breakout box tv  m taking sound tv hdmi thought would chance would 3d audio well 
tv gets stereo sound 3d audio
breakout box also recalculates picture sound tv social screen output without 3d information 
pendantic  stereo literally means 3d audio  https  enwikipediaorgwikistereophonicsound  wprovsfti1
good way reduce sound breathing psvr microphone 
mic sensitivity cranked way breathing still super loud psvr headset  friend play online issue  winds us able hear breathe super load games  especially physical games us moving bit  tips make quieter  since ca nt seem able switch headset mics 
 heavy breathing intensifies 
breathe nose mouth
breathe nose 
setting lower mic volume hold ps button controller  help bit fix
yoga 
’ using headphones supplied psvr  might reduce sounds swap rubber said headphones  ’ three sizes rubber default medium  would switch smaller size  rubber size effects noise cancellation  ’ 
yk sleep apnea  ’ fix  serious note ’ say try find way breathe ’ loud even picked like saw another guy say  make sort cover  ’ experienced issues ’ really say much  good luck though 
switch mic camera  
nice username 
get fit
already cranked minimum  mic still picks everything  made dang sensitive
bonito 
 nt know  option mic selection one vr headset
could next try piece tape mic hole  experiment much attenuates sound 
ca nt change mic vr  lets use vr mic  even mic camera mic whatever headphones re using  tried breathing  s overrated may find get away without   probably wo nt find   wear mask  everyone s used lately  give go  ll save 5 seconds trying find go later shops somewhere   unless re one people wander around spreading viruses everyone  case  try breathing thing put much effort manage  sound breathing people hear  whole crackly blowing mic thing 
mostly breathing gets even slightly heavier absolute rest  m 100  sure happens  always hear buddy releases breath aiming gun example  mask definitely good idea  ll try
suspect mask cause bigger problems  anyone wears glasses complaining past couple years  ll probably end badly vr  d definitely want let headset warm beforehand least  nt want steamy lenses

educational products like  platforms  electrical wiring simulator teaches tests welding students vocational schools properly lock outtag along tool usage safety aspects electrical work without risk getting shocked  lenovo headset called lenovo classroom dedicated educational use  others well  much far psvr goes

used happen occasionally  happens literally every single time boot headset  ever actual real fixes  edit  seems fixed  reduced frequency  use one 2 specific hdmi ports gpu one specific usb 31 port like 7 mobo lol  weird 
999  time loud static undervoltage condition  port re plugged supply enough amperage powered hub required provide supplemental power  mechanism behind static loss communication audio chip headset s internal hub browns  audio dac simply runs random data headphones bus powered amplifier causing load already teetering power balance causes oscillating power draw fed power starved audio chip causing static
issue  tried every usb luck  way managed fix getting powered usb hub 
lowered sampling rate sound settings  get couple times year  sound directed headset  right click volume icon taskbar  select  open sound settings  right side sound setting window opened  click  sound control panel   find click headset speakers  something like usb20 audio  select properties advanced  use 16bit dvd quality  hope helps 
nt know headset re using  g2 issue pogo pins make electrical contact speakers  usually removing speakers cleaning contacts resolves  bug encounter sometimes causes noticeable distortion wmr  sounds almost like static  metallic grating sound  s also nearly always isolated single channel  voltage issue  s software issue  restart always clears  headset nt get enough power  tracking fails first  followed connection issues 
lenovo explorer  one computers  amd system cheap motherboard  problem  tested usb ports one port could use without problem ever triggering  another one  using pciexpress usb3 controller card motherboard nt compatible usb3 port  one port card would nt trigger problem  bought hmd one friend never problem intel system  motherboard highend gaming one  time  current amd system  nt get static anymore use usb3 port  motherboard higher quality guess s factor 
digital static  check usb 3 lines  man  unplug anything else usb 3 ports system  check cable  adapters

plug hdmi graphics card  never motherboard lmao
well would nt say based experience  amd motherboard works pcie 4 amd motherboards pcie 3 
bios upgrades get sam  sadly made difference static noise time  still amd motherboard usb3 port working correctly  since works way m inclined research 
sure  point  s solved  end system needs good usb 3 chipset  s bit sensitive  example  could never make work extender 
ok ll try  unfortunately see people still saying nt working s worth try 
ve read reports nt fix people  
thanks tip  found son s computer bad static problem old headset last night  ordered one try  hopefully fixes things 
yes  typo  meant gpu  fixed 
guess s overall issue windowsmr 
took steps already  appears issue amd mobos  maybe x570 specifically  pci 40 usb something 
nt fix static issue unfortunately  ended getting usb extensions amazon basic one fixed issue 
nt  using shorter cable usb port otherwise unused internal usb controller  looks like product design fail headset  everybody knows usb power supply flakey many motherboards 
 m using exact one nt issue since  hopefully goes well well 
sucks  wonder solved addon usb 3x card 
show amazon link fixed  m confused basic usb extension would fix 
would use shorter cable  m using cable comes  nt detach lol
may  fixed   see post edit  also ordered powered usb 3 hub case  blows mind microsoft still nt fixed bullshit  ve seen complaints dating back like 2017 wmr headsets first launched

many people  included  use usb video extension cables use headsets away computer avoid connect headset back computer possibly wear gpu connector  cables  long bad quality  degrade signal bad enough cause noise 
yeah  guess s flaw original design  nt know headsets market kind  single  cable configuration  also bet current cable system limitation 
makes sense  however issue extensions lol 
m seeing history wmr headsets lol 
sound constantly image headset  ve tried restarting reinstalling resetting cables  still happens  help

update prevents bluetooth audio 
samsung odyssey plus using bluetooth plantronics headset  guess took vr break year  audio literally directed headset  happened  know update remove fix issue  let know 
odyssey uses bluetooth controllers  bt audio nt work well alongside game controllers  course year perhaps devices appeared area causing interference  smart bulbsappliancesswitches  phones  gamepads consoles  etc   make sure audio device properly selected  startbutton  r type  mmsyscpl press enter go playback  tab select plantronics headset click set default  button done still nt work try pairing samsung controllers pc 
run controlexe go sound  playback devices  realtek usb20 audio  disabled might right click check show disabled devices   run wmr portal see enables automatically  stays disabled  changes automatically device default device 
paired one controller sound still cuts soon sensor sees finger  ll try tomorrow 
disabled everything else  soon o sensor sees finger  sound gone 
turn sensor turning manual switching  actually probably wo nt make difference idk
success

hi everyone  ve experiencing issue o well acer wmr suffer extreme volume blast playing games experiences  ve read power delivery issue posts  purchased sabrent powered usb hub recommended  nt made change  furthermore  problem completely repeatable 100  consistency across wmr headsets  really seems like strictly power bug way manifesting  interactions steamvr wmr driver seem almost immediately trigger problem  absolutely expert could totally wrong  first exclusively noticed issue phasmophobia van start level large chance triggering bug spawn  nt given happen immediately happen couple sessions  games like vrchat alyx never suffer problem  regardless long play  however accidentally stumbled across trigger immediately makes bug manifest  steamvr home environment would open wmr steamvr driver menu  goggles icon steamvr toolbar  anywhere twenty seconds one minute later issue always appear without exception  powered unpowered  every usb port  ryzen  rtx system moving i7 4970  however never issues intel system  using powered hub  exact one recommended  ve tried every usb port  o functioned flawlessly 1300 hours intel system  anybody know specific bug taking place recommendations whatsoever        addition  specific issue nt effect massive number games  d really interested seeing many people   replicate  ryzen   systems opening wmr settings button steamvr home teleporting around  60 seconds   though use extreme caution set wmr volume 2   get loud enough damage ears hardware

thanks thoughts suggestions everyone  unfortunately yet find fix adjusting sound settings something attempt making post  optimistic seems ve started getting problem vrchat followup meaning wmr setup effectively done unless ms releases magic fix  reinstalled windows entirely point  looks like two surefire options either buy index upgrade alder lake setup  depressingly expensive options  alternatively could possibly try scope  known good  am4 motherboards  would cheapest logical step 
problem using odyssey ryzen 3700x rx 5700x  believe might ryzen problem similar hp reverb g2 problems amd systems   workaround  use  every time bug disable headset sound windows sound panel   reason  reanable without bug  games  fix  nt fix completely audio  like ragnarock sometimes loses song audio  also beat saber used give e score complete song used  fix  song  nt trigger makes bug happen  consistent game bug ragnarock 
able solve problem sort equalizer apo set headset audio turning preamp way whenever happened  one nt enough  add 3 preamp things  creates annoying quiet feedback noise
also issue past hp  lenovo hmd s  instance  use hdmi  usb extension cables  issue would occur  solution use powered usb hub  worked 6 months came back  bought another powered hub problem solved  6 months came back  point nt going buy another hub opted use pair g933 wireless headphones  since wireless produce small amount interference controllers s huge totally usable  dont issue nt use extension cables  active cables  used reset hmd issue occured actually necessary  disable audio reenable audio  temporary fix issue occur later though

logitech nt exactly make great audio products d hard pass spending 90 usd things
hope fit official case 
108 dollars  hell 
anyone know work kiwi headstrap  love kiwi headstrap would also love better audio 
think audio base headset fine
work officially battery strap 
like minimalist design wire management  sure putting money quest 2 point 
’ wondering faq confirm support elite elite battery straps  chorus work different accessories  logitech chorus attaches included soft strap well meta quest 2 strap options — elite strap elite strap battery  without interference 
neat  ordered one  ll try post review arrives 
ve something similar elite strap since january  really like  mine came  globular cluster  amazon re currently  43  also got amvr  small elite strap  case  fold headphones flush strap  everything fits case without take apart
would ve good 2 years ago  gon na invest anymore quest 2 3 releases  plus got psvr2 coming 2023 honestly next platform revive vr  re8 vr  re4 remake  horizon vr  among us vr  walking dead chapter 2 30 vr titles works 
wish meta would come something like 
really use quest 2 tethered pc decent headphones  see improving freestanding play without doubt
big companies popping quest accessories
personally love using bluetooth headphones  beat studios   nose cancelation makes really immersive play 
would great two years ago m sticking deluxe audio strap
go frankenquest never look back 
logitech  copy homework  valve  fine  ’ make obvious  logitech 
good luck lying
  90
preordered amazon  shall see 
disables data rift link via cable pcvr unavailable  m using q2 pcvr useless 
lol s nothing wrong built ones 
specs listed anywhere  red flag 
apparently support link cable via usb c word supporting third party straps like kiwi either  basically paper weight point  sure great quest 2 user vast majority play pc  s worth sadly  logitech dropped ball hard one  bloody shame cause would bought heartbeat used fucking 35mm jack 
nt understand people nt use bluetooth earbuds
fix shit graphics
 deleted 
would curious see causes tension usb port arm adjusted 
krx halo head strap comes something like optional attachments 
prettygood3d offear headphones quest 2  earphones great vr  best upgrade next strap 
pair bluetooth ear buds  dudios ones like  30 work awesome 
oof ’ nice
130 bucks hell naw🤣
pointing outward away ear  least s looks photo 
right side connected powered   
ninety pounds  fuck mate  m pretty sure saw exact thing half fuckin price 
40  max
ve using airpods 
possible solution use link disappointed usb c poweronly passthrough  use elite strap battery strapsolution  short usb c extension cable  keep logitech chorus powered  something like 
saw video mentioning  hope good 
d highly recommend moon drop chu  s insanely good sound quality 20   look put ear nt used iems
expensive  upgrades required make quest 2 comfortable  get better headset 
nt worry s  89 speakers attach headset
still love frankenquest vive elite strap
literally bought vr ears sale  would definitely work halo style strap 
would read review far logitech quest 2 audio products ’ great 
imo vive dasfrankenquest still best overall solution  terms sound strap quality   alsó  roughly price speaker  m curious sound compares 
bit late reply far best headphone solution found using pair  ksc75  headphones  kind clip onto ear pretty lightweight nt really notice  3d printer print mounts use normally    x200b  real downside cable m considering velcroing strap
would awesome  perfect vr setup
images walmart show s compatible elite strap  also passthrough charging usb c battery straps  https  wwwwalmartcomiplogitechchorusoffearintegratedaudioformetaquest2white1701213556
unsure bobovr last image product page shows fitting elite strap  s exclusive original one
use  bionik mantis headphones   https  amznto3k0visw  bobovr strap  tight fit  creaks putting  fit  barely  best solution found far 
remember thing like fit bobovr thing  gim moment ll find  edit  yep  hifix clip headphones 
good sound quality consider vr ears comes attachments fit headsets
agreed  got bobovr strap yesterday  superglue might involved 
got strap saw  😢
fit elite strap though
’ quest 2  quest 1  feeling waiting right thing  people might ok waiting whole year feel pretty patient vr world moment locked buying quest ’ another good option 
used use psvr wires kept getting tangled  currently use das quest padding becoming uncomfortable  m attaching battery pack headphone amp  wish bobovr good audio solution 
point das would better investment  ’ get modded adaptors quest 3 like quest 2  great strap  great audio 
i m sure really consider cambria direct successor q2  s aimed segment market  s business productivity device  price s likely launch would cover pc capable vr  connected q2  would probably feel like much bigger upgrade real terms
mean typically use headset already works fine good long ve using built speakers
bet gon na get something like quest 2 pro considering raised price nt think planning phseing quest 2 anytime soon 
nt mantis vr make something like psvr 
charging via usbc though  ’ complete non starter sadly   hell downvoted  weird subreddit 
making essentially useless pc users unless using airlink
basically throw bin  useless  paper weight point  sure quest 2 standalone users would get use majority pc users useless  used 35mm jack honestly 
charging     passthrough usbc data  mentioned link users 
 deleted 
audio strap tho  see soon   
definitely try another option  happy built audio  use headphones ’ night day 
audio base headset nt fine competitive gaming  thousands wins pop1 switching cv1 bought 2016 quest 2 cut damage kills half despite higher res display  purchasing das mandatory  ever play vr fps think people radar probably better audio 
says  s picture strap  page   https  wwwredditcomroculusquestcommentswqmvw9logitechhaveanewsoundsolutionforthequest2ikn8l7t  scroll 
literally says product page 
boat ’  came year ago  ’ probably pre ordered already  expect buy next headset  cambriaquest pro  launches sounds like could soon 
 use turtle beaches cord coiled strapped headset  used since day got quest  nt see standalone makes difference pc regards sound
last time tried using bt headphones terrible delay  year ago  updates improved bt sound drivers 
yeah ’ stand headphones let sound  like ear headphones common vr headsets   really subtracts immersion 
’ glad frankenquest mod first thing got quest 2 still couple accessories want get like controller grips afford one mod  would absolutely recommend frankenquest 
looked back went bobovr m2 pro  printed adapters fit das headphones  best  
could nt put better
looking 
usbc passthrough  could still plug additional usbc cable
airlink
’ want hassle dad headphones let try vr  commented built speakers terrible plugged x2hr ’ lmao  try pair open backed headphones  ’ world difference  need bass beatsaber 
use airlink virtual desktop
audio strap tho  see soon 
lag horrible  try play beat saber bluetooth earbuds notice mean 
lag 
 removed 
audio latency 
tbf 1   130 canadian maple leak dollars 2 probably best audio devices quest2  powered bmr speakers  3 s ton cheaper  lesser quality headphonesspeakers already market   50 mantis clip ons popular choice
fix bluetooth lag  tried using airpods long back half second delay much
apparently logitech reading customers 
bit late reply far best headphgone solution found using pair  ksc75  headphones  kind clip onto ear pretty lightweight nt really notice  3d printer print mounts use normally    x200b  real downside cable m considering velcroing strap
 hoping somehow logitechs would somehow work  das still best imo nt fit well quest 2  still original
yeah  s like s ton quality games coming vr right  arguably last good one early 2020  alyx   since things released mediocre  decent  bad  great either  lone echo 2 short really bad performance call actually good  s absolutely pressing need run buy vr hardware anyway  unlike say something like ps5 
ah  shortened wires mine  used rift  3d printed holders slide sides local library  clipped ear pieces koss  attached basically identical das  great sound  way cheaper  quest 2 m often swapping bobo kiwi  m using ears usual  considering bought like  20  ksc75 amazing value 
 deleted 
risky  das would fine quest 2 came  d get 3 years service  right  highly risky  look cambria  moved lot hardware mask strap  back strap thick heavy  looks like battery lot stuff got moved back  much better balance  s good chance quest 3 similar  aftermarket straps wo nt thing  ll able attach different padding  maybe diagonal top strap  nt think ll able replace entire strap way ve able quest 2 mean  s possible quest 3 closer quest 2 cambria  nt know  s huge risk  totally see quest 3 design cambria  das nt exactly cheap  quest 1 quest 2  lots things interchangeable  like prescription lens inserts  example  lenses size shape  lovely  nt see quest 2 stuff reliably compatible quest 3 promises eye tracking  potentially face tracking  etc  ll difficult stuff front  ll likely move hardware strap 
cambria wo nt quest 3  ll quest pro name  think  cambria supposedly coming yearearly next year  announcement annual show october  quest 3  actual follow quest 2  consumer headset  expected late 23  possibly early 24  window quest 1 quest 2 barely 18 months  re approaching 2 years past quest 2 s unreasonable see quest 3 late next year  past 3year mark 
s thing  ear headphones open back  mantis regular old closed back headphones supposed touch ears  based valve index headphones everyone loves 
fyi mantis fits bobo m2
yeah actually use quest think still get fits eliet strap bit tight fit get
s headset uses  would something specifically made headset  charges usb c  use usb c 
though    
phrasing lol  downvoters think want charge dc port something  obviously meant  charging  vs  charging  data link cable 
seriously actually uses cable since vd airlink 
heavily downvoted pointing lol
except majority pcvr users use wireless  s still cool product  using 35 limits ability use dsc power 
hello  looks like ve made mistake  s supposed could ve  ve  would ve  short could  would    never could  would   misspelled something  ai nt checking everything  beep boop  yes  bot  nt botcriminate 
yeah sucks  understandable presume ve got amp get drivers  solution using tectonic drivers index aux still awesome much better solution s good sound index despite bmr 
150 aud  oh come different places
 99 us 🤣  ’ stick x2hr ’  appreciate effort  ’ nice see big manufacturers getting vr space  hope sells well 
fuck get  scan page smallest number 
sooo nt saving pennies vive das frankenquest adapters  😄
read tried using carefully routed nice iem buds  thought dangly super fiddly hanging earphones super annoying made realize airpods pro 2 w new low latency tech mandatory kind audio hardware  wired inear vr doa 
sometimes connect headphones honestly ’ usually listening music whenever play vr unless ’ something like vader immortal
mostly play solo games tho
’ maybe experienced delays twice  also play using virtual desktop pc  audio quality signal ’ issue 
store page explicitly says “ charging usbc passthrough ”
option people like flying combat flight sims  see compression artifacts negatively effecting spotting distance visual identification distance 
option everyone 
good solution  s perfect one  link cable available backup imo essential  0 reason headphones ca nt work via 35mm plug instead 
looking forward 
 deleted 
nt mine 
ve heard m pretty sure s 50 bucks us also definitely valid point lesser quality choices even amazon remember ugly ass earmuff style ones nt good coverings anything claimed improve sound quest build speakers nt work 🤣 one youtuber tested definitely sucked also cheap
think comes late quest 2 lifespan really matter  would must 2 years ago  moreover s logitech audio product  130 canadian kinda hard recommend price  expensive  late  look nice ll give
oof ’ noticed delay maybe 
doubt ’ data back ’ gon na go ahead assume overwhelming majority quest users casual ’ care strap use  default ’ good enough  plus ’ good chunk people care strap use default genuinely works fine head  …but casual vr users probably gon na fine default speakers  really market niche within niche hardcore vr users willing buy accessories ’ felt need buy alternate strap
nt forget trover saves universe golden😁
def sound quality really surprisingly good 
yeah  original rift prints required bend ear clips  quest print used ’ clips fasten mounts  bobo m2 pro quest 2 ’ really good option  also soldered ksc 75 cable perfect length extra cable manage  good sounding phones get right mounts  really need sit flush ears best sound  wish printer could tweak 
read comment responded regarding koss headphones person  ed  
q3 continues  cheaply produced possible  keep enduser price low  mantra  doubt ll see anything like battery back head – base model  s expensive manufacture 
’ right  moving components back strap logical move  would make das incompatible 
das even though m going get cambria launch passthrough  stuck default audio huge turn means ca nt resell quest 2 good audio critical competitive gaming 
thank  idea actual q3 coming  remembered people calling cambria last time paying attention  make price increase curious move  ve everything increase userbase ve made bad idea buy one entire year 
probably see think remember well never owned valve index remember seeing however nt vive though 
really 
definitely imagine tight fit 
’ usbc data pass  ’ talking 
means ca nt use bobovr battery strap elite battery strap
oculus link requirement  simple 
used store page s phrasing lol
well  sim racing lol
lol  everyone 
link cable backup imo essential  wireless pcvr solutions great  flawless perfect  reason couldnt go 35mm jack  couldnt proper data passthrough  would happily pay extra 10  20 functionality imo 
oh well  thought 3 pairs screenshot seems like something s cheaper poland
indeed 🤣
keep pennies  ll see   
playing beat saber airpods max connected quest wonderful experience  ’ stand ear headphones 
ah  go  used rock puzzling places podcasts 
really  well ’ missed opportunity ’ case 
good router cause nt really notice anything  admittedly nt play flight sims barring star wars squadrons problems 
maybe need better  dedicated  wifi 
fix setup  zero issues
thought s normal link issue  wanted uncompressed ve gone better headset
d imagine power supplied usb connection used amplifier things 
yet dumb comment  comment vr subreddit ’ even use vr 
beat saber example cant even played bluetooth headphones  crashes launching song due game handling audio latency reason  function settings set audio latency still crashes 
hoping sequel show eventually 
wtf  showed comment main comment reply another comment  bad  removed reply 
’ already cambria  makes sense move components back head weight actually benefiting headset opposed making worse  less weight front weight back excellent comfort  imo biggest issue vr headsets rn 
think simply sold live cost price best selling killing every competition  competitors price range  pico ca nt compete software  native games optimization ca nt produce many headsets  thinking earn something least 
’ pictures attached elite battery strap  ’ got usc c pass
importantly  use oculus link  hope short usbplugcable unplugged without detaching entire headphone assembly 
 usb c passthrough  picture used elite battery strap site 
""
ok
doubt lol
lol  actually read  
maxes heard latency made airpods actually useful  try 
router equation  tested 200mbps bitrate  max airlink bitrate nvidia  cable see artifacs  400mbps fine see problems  point  il2 dcs spot bandits small dot low bitrates usually erased  also night flights horrible low bitrate expecially terrible banding sky clouds  anyway m happy cable need airlink 
dedicated router empty channel  two important wifi6 anything fancy like  tried options
thanks 
fine cable 
  different pico neo 3 link example  display port comes 5m cable included native 90hz pcvr  specs otherwise almost identical 
anyways  ’ waisting time explaining flappy pirate 😄
got game recently ’ far good yeah devs definitely follow trover saves universe
worries 
makes sense  s expensive  cambria  quest pro  different type headset  price  800  according facebook   s likely double price q3 
power  s link compatible  edit  stop booing  s written compatible french website  local logitech website    charging  compatible optional usb c link cable  https  wwwlogitechcomfrfrproductsvrchorusformetaquest2982000154html
yeah  read usb passthrough charging  suck  personally use virtual desktop air link  remain unbothered   seems like worthy successor broken das 
one cares link  5  quest owners use pcvr majority use airlink virtual desktop 
pcvr core use case quest 2 airlink ’ work wireless layout current townhouse 
used cable connect max ’ quest  ’ way avoid latency 
systems compress video  try adjust video bitrate airlink  maybe virtual desktop 
yes  right 
may reuse technology q3 without lot ar focused features cambria 
elite strap w battery nt link compatible either  s earphones would remove functionality
plug… headset… directly computer edit  thought talking battery headphones whoops 
source 
find  website mention explicitly power  also say usbc passthrough  nt sound like power  edit  nevermind  found faq  sucks
ah considered  ’ bit hesitant use quest mostly workout ’ consider maxes purpose normally  ’ willing give shot  using mini plug lighting adapter  use male male mini plug also  length cable  extra details would helpful 
 adjust video bitrate magical air link virtual desktop  router  settings minimize compression artifacts extent dialing wired link bitrate 500mbps  nt  ca nt tell nt care difference re lucky  really  wireless still trump cable terms usability always quality difference configured optimally 
also airlink limits resolution 2800 wire 3600  max wire limit around 4064px
french logitech website  https  wwwlogitechcomfrfrproductsvrchorusformetaquest2982000154html
got cable apple  https  wwwapplecomukshopproductmxk22zmalightningto35mmaudiocable12mwhite think standard lighting aux female  aux male male would work well 
yes  tested max airlink bitrate 200mps cable  best get good router  decided use 
yes
numbers comment added 69 congrats  22  35  12  69
yep also maters nvidia gpu vs amd one  amd one worse artifacting way smaller bitrate limit  stick bluetooth aptx earbuds play unless want smth relaxed use audio heatset  comment main post

bought last night steam  could nt get try though life came
sounds like cortana
tried opening bit  unbelievable graphics  ca nt believe s native q2 
m big video game player   never get  played game hours yesterday  s amazing 
completed red matter 1 super quickly never really bothered play  real replayability red matter 2  obviously  nt care fancy ray tracing d settle solid chunk gameplay time  replayability
think render resolution way low 
quest 2 using link 
picked one today  played 10 mins see visuals live hype  honestly  m pretty stunned  someone dev team must sold soul devil  genuinely nt think native quest 2 game could look good  got installed pc well  ll interesting comparison  honestly looks damn good natively d happy play way 
teleporting lot motion slightly nausea inducing 
thanks review  red matter looks dope  ’ checking tonight
’ like first one  best  half  game year  two one whole game 
need play first one 
good graphics  pretty boring gameplay 
pc  graphics absolutely insane  q2 graphics look amazing  pcvr brings next level  s incredible  120hz  17 ss 
say gamers fat basement dwelling trolls  man unit  someone come get yo grandad 
saw intro video game like yesterday  got excited saw s mostly puzzle game got bored
looks boring af  walk around slowly plug shit shit lore ear entire time 
graphics nice quest 2 still looks blurry
know s real reviewer gets 10 minutes names game game year  
 removed 
question  better buy steam play buy quest 2    x200b  cheers advance  
movement similar resident evil  really appreciate graphics  movement causes little motion sickness  ’ tried times  always feel little 
kind game red matter  horror  puzzle  
’ amazing  story  sound  textures  interactivity  faultless 
great graphics ’ make good game  ’ fun children youtubers paid cough mean “ sponsored ” play 
newest update made content trivial  half way noticed 3d  hacking  puzzles pointer telling exactly move  ball thing  little blimp targeting line showing s trajectory 
’ really need recommend play 1 first 2 much better playing 1 2  d bit disappointed 
quite needed summary happened first  s still excellent game  except new surpasses every way going back later might bit disappointing 
yes  one like half game worth play time  need get whole game  first one easier less pretty earlier story  ’ play first  
loved 1  nt played 2 yet   even nt  need   d say  graphics gorgeous 1st one  btw 
playing red matter 2 think first one better story  ’ need know story play second one 
bundle  43
price still seems kind steep 5  3 hour game  also s replayable 
think alot us playing weekend
pcvr games crappy   sir  s taste aaalike polish feels like vr 
came yesterday  surprised 
guess depends whether playing  established protagonist  mean  play lara croft  alyx vance  etc  even nt fit character irl 
ive felt way since wolfenstein 3d  thanks aknowledging lol
think depends ’ playing game  main character generic placeholder customizable  half life alyx  example   play alyx      ’ main character  would ridiculous suggest able lighter skinned hands play game  man ’ hands matter  would absurd demand option play tomb raider “ larry croft ”  largely agree point  ’ definitely game game basis  imo 
playing russian guy  color expect hands  hands characters hands  players hands first minutes s wearing gloves  even women play game  character story male  custom avatar  would point 
wrong opinion
whole argument back dumb tiktok  thought lot    s thing   s nonissue         every single vr game   able change skin tone   m talking multiplayer games games re nameless protagonist like blade sorcery    skin tone color options  might one two ca nt think  nt really make industry problem  games nt games play specific person  robot  break immersion    games like half life alyx  instance  nt care white man playing blasian girl darker skin  nt care playing girl  neither things problem  s character  fact  real  annoyance s short lock 5  6  even though m 6  tall  know annoying go easily seeing high objects jump  could nt even see top basic lockers  kinda liked new experience though  anyway  nt found game yet nt skin tone options  skin tone options   ted talk 
think agree others s game game basis  like  re getting updates supposedly grand theft auto san andreas supposed coming quest point supposedly near future  s game main character  main character  cj  black  m sure feel thought taking character black man giving players option turn white  like others said  makes sense multiplayer games re playing s less character avatar options make whatever avatar feel represents  nt know storybased games re playing character instead playing  nt know  know cj black  nt know would feel weird turning cj white hands match hands  know recent game played vr resist  game main character s female  hands operate game smaller side feminine shape  voice female voice  nt even think  instantly accepted playing character  fact m male yet hands feminine voice ears female voice  yknow  nt even come consideration playing character  assume ll feel way eventually play gta san andreas  yeah  ve decided would actually feel  really  weird uncomfortable way option make cj white  think able pick skin color avatar  nt think able pick skin color gender character  s like  m reading jane austen novel  main character woman  nt get customize book make main character man  stories characters  s difference videogames like gamessports point game gameplay versus storybased videogames point game story  even within story games  s story games like skyrim fallout main character blank slate real characterization story world re exploring versus story game like life strange main character max story max  s like  call duty overwatch fortnite sports  life strange gta fiction  part point fiction experiencing things someone else s perspective instead perspective

wish people would epiphany complain “ wokeness ” video games  one person ’ want change gender skin color ’ mean someone else ’ immersive experience 
yes  s cool developers realize able choose skin color featurebenefit players value  s one aspects would never think put game read people enjoying  however  also think s one features seems trivial implement unless account early enough development s probably insignificant amount work actually pull correctlywell  technical level also presentationui level  sure  s trivial make working color picker ui element s trivial make one looks good  feels good  bug free  blends well ui aesthetic  bury function settings menu nobody find unlesss go looking integrate tutorial process every player  gets complicated quickly  think ultimately become core functionality avatar sdks vr gets bigger  d cool avatar sdk basic functionality games nt want use specific avatar could still query specific features like skin color  eye color  gender  etc use ways felt relevant game make  easy  developers use information drive things  hell  could even get crazy  voice styleaccent  fromborn could make character sound like something closer want sound like  s going really cool see things evolve get figure core functionality start focus adding quality life type features makes vr unique platform 
sigh  s   game 
earned grays  gamer since atari 5200
walmart  😂
space exploration  mystery  escape room grande scale…  ive played first one years ago  excellent  honestly never finished first one…  dont played first one imo im sure u would appreciate one even 
played moss 2 three hours red matter 2 far  would give moss 2 technical level s even close though  red matter 2 crazy impressive ve managed get quest 2  s environments game platform even comes close  really look like pcvr game time  actual gameplay  s right  puzzles nt spectactular anything  story seems bit disjointed  ve also heard s 56 hours long nt much price  moss 2 allround better game imho  gorgeous artstyle  varied  far anyway  gameplay  decently long  well worth playing though 
totally different kind game  compared 
went head got pt2
ca nt answer  dev hyping release couple weeks ago said addressed amount content main complaint 1st game  expect s lot longer 
 adventure style games like really need alternate endings based decisions make  would nt hard script 3 4 different ways game go  even old fighting fantasy books used read kid multiple paths endings 
quest 2
thx bro ive earned grays  gaming since atari 5200
played first one honestly never finished it… way better first one  excellent tho  think u fine coming blind
wish cross buy 
game involves thinking solving puzzles  ’ thing  likely ’ enjoy  thing  game looks amazing 
game grown  go back gorilla tag vrchat 7 year old friends 
""
 s clearly using oculus 
buy quest 2 ’ get pc version free rift store 
buy quest 2 
movement one pretty slow gentle fine unless sensitive games  ’ also comfort settings  resident evil actually pretty bad motion sickness since movement bit fast jerky ’ many comfort settings 
feel pain 
sure whether re locked locomotion game  resident evil teleport  s play  much calmer stomach 
s puzzle game  nt much  first one puzzles obscure nt anything much actual game 
story good 2 1  1 best writing quest 
dunno re downvoted  vr game prices indeed high  however  vr games effort make fewer potential customers compared flat screen games cost  red matter nt expensive anything else store 
first game took like 5 hours  nt played 2nd one yet  adventures  always replay great ones  s worth 
eat burgers every day go fine restaurant 
think situation bit different vr immersion important  something pulling game experience easily addressed   ’ even suggesting changing protagonist  cases toggle pair gloves would sufficient 
s nowhere near important  s nice vr lefthanded  early flat screen fpses allowed lefthanded character view modern ones 
get point would totally play game play larry croft lol
suggesting black russians 
alyx dynamically scales world make shorter  cool  arkham vr similar thing make batmanheight  fool kneeling calibrate everyone turns dwarf 
fact alyx  larger gentleman  quite enjoyed using dainty little lady hands 
race  think speak one  s non issue  nt mean s non issue  like gatekeeping  add red matter 2 list games nt allow change skin color 
 deleted 
think case vr might little different  skin certain tone move arms around see different tone game  s gon na break immersion 
agree almost 100  part fiction seeing character portraying games like alyx  halflife2  etc  sure  games generic person x  allow decide choose match skin color    call duty  etc  white nt default   
would hilarious idea game studio trying stir pot  make provocative game white privilege  white trash  benefitting racial injustice etc  d get much hate right  praise wokecrtblmmarxist crowds  next year release arab man simulator 
 feels racist would say certain way  think projecting something nt stated anywhere 
crossbuy 
   
judge clip seem like space station simulator  m going look  game play  nt  really would nt say  grown  anyone  people keep saying looks great  really vr  nt make game great 
lmao  says guy throwing tantrum someone else ’ like game much  thoroughly enjoyed first red matter  could easily see people would find boring tedious  ’ everyone   ’ mean ’ “ grown ”  seriously idea could connect dots 
 s right  game looks boring 
probably thinking pcvr exclusive fancy graphics  p
s quest 2 
game quest2 
nt listed crossbuy store  though
yes probably triggered people  think entertainment value per hours played kind high compared even games replayable  probably wait longer considering  original red matter ’ buy short game complaints reviews 
mean  half life alyx vr game  pair gloves nt going turn male character male player  ca nt speak others imo game great immersive either way 
 immersed vr white hands robot hands whatever throw  would gloves make difference unless also wearing gloves irl tactile feel 
character wears gloves game 
 ’ called uncharted 
even better larry david 
suggesting story written style soviet era russia like black protagonist  character story white male  nt want play game white male  pick another game 
 arkham vr similar thing make batmanheight  best part re kid bruce wayne watch parents perspective kid  well  fictional rich white male kid 40s full disclosure  felt immersion  vr alternate reality  even someone else  like batman  m bored real 24 hours day  m moments 
 add red matter list games play russian guy nt get pick skin color russions soviet era 
like told guy  read whole comment want understand point  clearly 
suggest reading entire previous comment better understanding point 
given ridiculous  unrealistic scenarios happen games  find quite odd   breaks immersion  mean  aliens ’ exist real life  ’ break immersion 
think people tired crap created ones  mainly divide get money mess generate  also  think people able take 1st degree  lot weird people 
see  comment  joke white hands  downvoted  tells long state mind people 
except whole point privilege people nt understand understand privileges nt get white  would need make black manwoman simulator could understand point view things   honest something think would incredibly helpful teach peoples point views  imagine playing woman gaslit abused  indian child sent conversion school beaten left die hands church forced become white christians  black man experiences racism daily basis  sooooo many topics could explored  many things understand experience vr potential give us 
buy   thanks  
lol tantrum  …  right  😉 👍🏼 edit  downvotes fuel children
guy boring  ’ whole story  sorry game mature 
s quest   regardless game quest2
plenty things ’  looking game ’ store page basically guarantee accurate indication whether ’ cross buy  simply ’ go anymore  ’ able long time  accurate list cross buy apps third party database like  https  vrdbappquestindexushtml  filtercrossbuyapps even meta ’ cross buy category page incomplete  far fewer titles listed 168 link posted  idea meta suck much making cross buy transparent simple 
agreed alyx truly masterpiece  personally never desire toggle  understand people could benefit  said  pale guy  really ’ issue  even alyx ’ hands pretty neutral shade  ’ never position human hands meaningful different mine  apparent thread demand 
gloves ’ part persons identity  better worse  skin tone 
yeah  fingerless gloves 
dont play larry croft  play nathan drake  doesnt pointy breasts 
read whole comment twice  essentially saying  s non issue non issue  games see arms  change skin color  except  non issue  s non issue   edit  silver low effort comment  also  m leaving   add low effort comment 
bash game  m curious exactly find  mature   kind weird argument tbh
yea well  guy  one made fp  saw another post people shilling guy cleans toilet  marketing bots nt fooling actual customers 
’ pc 
thanks link  s definitely useful
gloves fingerless 
first   re  second    think important game like half life alyx  specific character core part story game  able change skin color  gender   read book perspective vietnamese child gender  would change age  race gender head better identify  m inclusion  think brought much better point gave credit  address  s chance 
would nt expect someone read comment twice ask question answered comment  leaves curious reading comprehension skills  regardless  vr skin color one two games might available problem  ve got bigger issues 
’ know good game came behind tickled balls 
played tentacular outraged could nt change color tentacle arms  outraged 
“ ’ chance ” lol  man thinks quite highly 
ah yes  edit end sling insult  nice touch 👌
agree  im might even consider “ woke left winger ” genuinely believe vr skin colour issue people  looking  issues 
ok

headphones attached think ’ worthwhile upgrade 
feel like engineering solve simple problem  people mention playing spotify headsets browser  still seems convoluted  ca nt play cell phone computer  someone cited immersion factor nt make sense re already playing music top game sounds 
re playing pc  know  play music pc would play quest match output device 
nothing wrong grass roots innovation  new creative ideas accidentally made  keep tinkering 
want hear music quest sessions  bt headphones wouldnt help 😀
headphones 
need aptx low latency game  q2 support  could use aptx usb bt transmitter though  exclude powerbank  really like integrated headphones didnt want waste much money  mod costs 1520   im pretty sure 2 channel bt aptx low latency earbuds  aptx usb transmitter pretty expensive 
😂😂😂😂😂😂
20k mah powerbank much worse 😄
parts rly cheap though  think 1520  mixer  bt module dc downstepper 
would neat 😄
seconded
tbh  idk 😄 name usb bt receivertransmitter 5  amazon  think theyre pretty similar  least cheap ones 
thx 😄
ive bended little bit upwards  less pressure  ive placed backhead pad top  back im using belvin vr mod powerbank holder 
theyre called bionik mantis vr  playstation vr headphones  theyre rly perfect m2 bobo  ive used ears rly good comfort update  paid 30   good deal 
ofc could use oculess sideload spotify another media player   always fragile  controlling mediaplayer ig problem  adjusting volume mediaplayer problem  performance problem sometimes games audio crashed completely  hardware solution seems top first  really comfortable use  works without problems compromises  dont say solution everyone  ofc play music speaker play pc vdlink  im voice chat 95  time  dont want music leak mic annoy friends  control volume pause music instant wrist remote  need full game volume hear footsteps etc  pop1 contractors  im using week  ive rly accepted normal quest feature  think looks complicated expensive  mean 15  nothing  little bit soldering  didnt even made 3d printed case yet  ur right  simple solution would integrated music player inside quest os 
im playing native time  ur using vdlink dont need solution ofc 
ve explained well post  want listen blue tooth music bluetooth headphones nt work

buy headphones connect multiple devices  artis wireless pro  connect quest 2 desktop simultaneously 
obviously
control volume song via another device  phone  spotify yeah 100  ideal suppose  definitely update v41 much smooth v40 many bugs

bluetooth speaks audiophile  d get far better audio quality trick re using 
ive used last week really fun  even competitive games like pop1 contractors  thought could interesting ppl  rly cheap rebuild  1520  
well  u use linkvd  yeah  playing music pc background pretty easy 😄 focused native quest gamesusage
latency  q2 aptx low latency  get 500600ms normal bt 
bt blasted cheap open air headphones cm away ears 
bluetooth audio codecs nt terrible like ldac
lol  bottleneck bluetooth  ’ absolute garbage speakers headset  bluetooth become bottleneck headphones reach price 400500 
ah  good job  ive never seen something like  im guessing tho might way sideload spotify quest   
oh yeah stuff requires low latency use pcvr get game audio pc directly  even best case scenario  bluetooth audio always bit laggy  would nt stuff like beat saber bt personally  aptx  
yes  none considered audiophile quality  researched current codec standards part embedded systems work  ’ better used 
sure  nt using built speakers  said looks like using psvr mantis nearly bad  point still stands  bluetooth  never spoken audiophile  s essentially oxymoron  reference  bluetooth becomes bottle next long  beyerdynamics dt150 found well 200 bluetooth connection fed absolutely deteriorate sound  point s funny someone would claim bluetooth speaks audiophile  nt matter setup 
sideload spotify use background oculess  basti   several problems solution  1  volume control  control music volume spotify  music android app  ur game party chat  2  since v40 u use button mapper control music player  u start music start ur game  like skip songs pause etc  3  performance worse solution  audio games wont work  came hardware solution rly works well 
exactly reason mod  costs  15   course
oh true nt think actually  good job 
also  think lot people assume everyone uses spotify s case 
enable background audio playback meta quest pro using v47 update  quest pro  vr

meta focuses fixing fugging bugs came quest 2 v44  s simple play music background play vr  re called earbuds phone  s dumb fug finite resources way  especially platform issues need fixed first
anyone know feature available quest 2 
love solution 👌
quest pro double ram quest 2 running applications nt need  nt bad feature 
news coming quest 2 however  still supporting quest 2 mainstream headset likely come  stay tuned youtube channel latest information
one else hear music coming  background play  anyways  use headset resources provide 
ll give  quest pro  opinion  allow us float couple 2d apps within vr application least within webxr application  could useful  would way cooler option could actually share music friends though  otherwise  earbuds still make sense 
thank  😁

new  feature  quest pro headsets playing music background hear  s shared experience  ca nt say vr chat friends   listen  s cool  share hearing  peripherals make sense less likely cause performance issues headset  rather install bunch movie tv apps headset  connected android tv box  use computer  use phone watch tv imaxsized screens anywhere house  thank walmart  20 wonder  might try official google tv next
see mean  would awesome feature  meta fire zuck hire 
connected android tv box headset   mean video output android tv box quest 2  
kept tight ties samsung well  samsung dex mode could modified specifically work inside headsets  nebula app used nreal glasses cool version could made quest headsets  nt want job  zuck made facebook ugly word hearts many  s exploitation  manipulation corporate gain  s disgusting would nice oculus could go back days relative autonomy focus good experience rather gimmicks profit usability

bobovr m2 strap currently use earphones audio  would prefer something wider audio would allow hear things around better  headphones could fit  fit ym head strap  kinda loose easily fall moving head around  built speakers nt  ve heard putting something directs audio ears improves lot  ve tried hands indeed better  anyone know accessory would something like  straight speakers  bobovr strap 
 deleted 
excited  disappointed got headset silicone ears would nt fit  silicone ear muffs wear perfect  hope keep simple cheap like 
oooooh  nice thanks letting know

chorus quest 2  white noise hissing leftright audio channels reversed
far fantastic start chorus quest 2  sounds great     two issues     even 0 bars volume  chorus hissing quite loudly  sort white noise sound   leftright audio channels reversed  plug chorus  sounds backward native oculus games virtual desktop  anyone something similar 
hi  new project understand content want see roculusquest    post fits purpose roculusquest    upvote   comment   post fit subreddit    downvote   comment  post breaks rules    downvote   comment   report   post 
anyone interested  logitech confirmed chorus quest 2 replacement  waiting shipment    update  share experience     thank patience  would like inform replacement approved    shipped receive email tracking number use track package    please nt hesitate let know questions replacement arrived    regarding defective product  please make sure keep least receive new one confirm issue resolved    may receive survey regards support experience encourage take moment provide opinion continue better customer experience  thanks much  
yes  experience quite audible hissingstatic noise left speaker  expected active speakers  however s point distracting audible even games  reducing volume quest nt reduce hissing coming speakers tells internal amp driving bmf speaker always cranked internal max gain  volume quest purely controls input volume  chorus exposed volume controls internal amp  think could greatly alleviated simply always feeding full volume quest headset  reducing volume chorus amp  s unfortunate  speakers really sound absolutely great  lightyears better vr ears  two sets  sound awful comparison 
confirm hiss absolutely atrocious  makes feel like brain condition tinnitus  absolutely ridiculous got released s current state  also  soon turn volume levels d call loudish  bass gets overdriven distorts real fast  hundred bucks real disappointment 
absolutely sure comes chorus  problem  unplugged chorus hissing still  end    fan front q2 producing hiss    never heard earplugs ve using accustically isolated 
s definitely noise floor chorus s noticeable unless surrounding completely silent  leftright pan seems correct 
experienced severely reduced battery life installing chorus  mean  makes sense since powered vis usb  m surprised rapidly full charge goes zero  m using elite strap battery 
experiencing hiss  would rather use crappy built speakers hiss  s bad  also  fact constantly triggers passthrough adjusting annoying  often register battery strap headset charged normally  nt get percentage displayed external battery  combined numerous reports reversed audio channels  man  seems like logitech really nt qa thing enough  m returning mine  logitech stops asking general qa troubleshooting  like plugging different usb port using hub  man s bad look company s support team clearly nt try address specific product   worth  130 cad product fundamentally broken 
hey  thought might interested learning received replacement unit  fact maybe little less  hissy   s great  although difference   subtle best  little improved  m realizing noise level appears within acceptable parameters logitech  apparently users sensitive  m happy able ship replacement within short time  m happy slight improvement first unit  however  used chorus time  initial pair  least   ve found appears sorts weird usb connectivity issues  elite strap battery  quest  likely power management issue quest  frequently complain s battery left sometimes lose connection battery strap  regain shortly thereafter  internal battery empty close  headset turn  probably unrelated chorus  m sure 
got unit week  receiving email weeks ago delay shipping could make updates product s firmware   unfortunately  m getting hissing   seems like whatever updates ve recently done product nt help  got unlucky  hissing really terrible  please update get new unit 
completely agree  way noise level kind system produce  wondering made past quality control  tried contacting logitech support issue  still waiting reply  yes sound great 
really  regarding vr ears  chorus come adapters different headsets like vr ears  understood attach myriad aftermarket head straps  original  work replacement head straps 
use  hiss gets bit silent still obnoxious  actually felt actual distortions  hiss sounds really decent  spatial audio much better default sound quest  28 email exchanges deep logitech support  hoping get replacement  confirm happens 
definitely chorus  noise unplugged  default speakers  made recording  sounds https  youtubeckqg4gkxiwk even hear  chorus gets enabled hissing  mean booting liftingmuting ear  q2 fan really quite  s barely audible 
got lucky probably  sound like  https  youtubeckqg4gkxiwk sound level bit elevated recording  s aint great 
drains bit faster  usually nt use quest longer 2 hours  try time long battery last  without 
actually timed long sessions puzzling places max volume  measured full battery  low  battery warning  difference 10 minutes  instead 210 got 200 
yeah  device clunky af  issues  also times stop working mid session  reconnect cable  hiss subsides use  bit  get used  s working s really good  much immersion sound direction  quest 2 onboard audio sounds flat compared 
note problem reverse audio channels goes away anybody ever reported  s almost chorus updating firmware first use  fixing initial quirks 
interesting get firmware updates  specify anything firmware updates done  arrive next week  post update soon possible 
 s ticket  m awaiting followup email 
chorus works official straps metaoculus  unfortunately  unfortunate  one advantage approach look completely seamless quest  looks like re part way probably would nt possible design needed accommodate popular vr headset  vr ears comes adapters different headsets  terms sound quality  really match chorus  also  must suffering quality assurance issues  original pair well replacement received rma suffer crackling issues  re also quite heavy  require charged separately quite frequently  ca nt adjust tilt position easily   install  sound quality important  really leagues apart  actually  getting vr ears  concluded  falsely  ear headphones simply nt sound great on overear headphones  would index reverb g2  wrong  chorus speakers positioned closer ears vr ears ones  quest 2 mount least   helps preserve rich bass response  sound much fuller  less noisy  would really happy customer 
today  ve investigating hiss  s easy  s barely audible  even moving arm produces noise  clothing  hear hiss  unplug chorus  hiss stops half second continues internal speakers  connect chorus  hiss stops keeps silent hit volume button  top  hiss comes fan  ca nt hear wearing headset 
scientific way  past two years ve practically never battery low warnings  play sessions tend around 13 hours  however  chorus  m getting warnings 15 hours  would expect least 3 hours battery strap  support staff nt given updates since first response standard usb troubleshooting tips  s absolutely terrible experience thus far 
guess re using battery strap  battery strap relatively new condition expect quite bit charge  chorus drains much power headset seems reduce battery life 34 hours around 2 
oh built quest speakers sound trash  even without comparing chorus  ve heard dlc songs beat saber enough normal headphones speakers recognize bad quest  hiss  man oh man  m really sensitive kinds things  stop watching latest house dragon episode could hear random clickingpopping throughout first 10 minutes  idea issue knew could nt put  despite otherwise great audio setup  regardless much better chorus might built speakers  hiss personally make overall worse experience 
m sure get firmware updates s left factory  s email   dear customer  know excited get logitech chorus  re excited ship  wait may little longer  ve completed final firmware update wanted take little time make sure get best experience possible  shipping logitech chorus within 3 weeks let know way  thanks patience see metaverse  friends logitech   theory  able work meta issue updates quest s firmware  similar controllers get updated  maybe release app quest could update chorus   fact say  final firmware update  nt seem imply ve gone route  also  immediately lost bit respect logitech read sentence  see metaverse  
 please update receive comments regarding issue  lr audio normal  sure happened 
sorry experience  got vr ears release day  pledgebox   first hours requiring  burn  time get full quality issues crackling anything else  mine lasts hours needing charge  outlasts b2 battery headset charge  see value aesthetic looking like belong  agree ability reposition could little less tedious  takes less 30 seconds loosen allen screw tighten back  reposition since release day  nt really noticed weight  perhaps bobovr balances headset well head  use bobovr m2 pro battery strap  chorus go  would never buy oculus elite strap  talk qa issues  meta comcast years ago  worst support softwarehw qa almost anyone  mention meta charges obscene high amounts accessories less half price elsewhere  things vr  everything fits everybody s tastes 
lucky  hiss absolutely audible  chorus powers  pop sound  tell chorus working  yes  works  unplug itreplug  s hitting volume button 
well 2 years  batteries start degrading  normal wear suppose  added even power drain mix  depending many cycles  well maintained batteries drop 80  60  original capacity  probably hardcore vr player  got low battery warning maybe  adding chorus  create negative experience  also  quest like 6 months old  maybe also contributes 
saying high battery drain chorus specific  elite strap battery   would weird indeed 
s interesting  thanks posting email  hope ll find changes firmware 
got utterly generic response back  trying different usb port    testing without usb hub    plugging another device   really nt make sense respect chorus  ticket escalated higher level support probably provide similar loweffort troubleshooting tips  meantime  testing chorus  gotten point really unpleasant turn speakers  ears ringing almost hurting short play sessions bombarded white noise  m conflicted speakers  look vr headset  looks amazing  sound amazing offear speakers  noise quite frankly unbearable  think rma way forward  really hope general problem isolated units  like  m getting feeling common  really nt get one else really mentions  nt seen single reviewer mention  first thing noticed turned  absolutely certain done something wrong  damaged transport  maybe s matter everyone sensitive  m really hoping possible way tap firmware lower internal preamplifier gain  ll take lower maximum volume day audible noise  expect noise diminish greatly gain lowered 
since many problems disappear first play session  well   suspect  nt know sure  chorus gets firmware updated quest via usb  power cycle activates 
yeah  whole thing burnin really grinded gears  pseudoscience best  s whole different discussion another day  re happy vr ears  s really matters  power  purely subjective experience  felt like pretty substantial upgrade go chorus 
think point trying make internal speakers hiss way intensity  also independently actual volume setting  nt excuse chorus  puts relation bit 
nt quite follow logic  never issues battery draining right moment installed chorus  expect play 15 hours max getting warning  s effectively half  beyond  course degradation expected  one day  m surprised much difference chorus makes battery life 
m saying battery life  nothing  nothing less  significantly shorter  re talking half  goes initial unit well replacement unit  ended rmaing first speakers hopes less hissy replacement   issues well  see others thread  pairing chorus battery strap via passthrough  importantly nt detect extended battery almost ever  rather appears headset  charging   restart headset seems like unplug replug extended battery strap chorus make pass correctly quest  quirks  difficult tell much related quest firmware driving usb controller  much remedied firmware updates chorus  right  comparing noise  battery life general stability  nt think chorus worth  unfortunate  s rare product like really  really want like  holding back much pass threshold 
forwarded another logitech rep came perfect response solve problems   thank patience    personally apologies delay response  kindly accept sincere apology matter    evaluating receiving update internal team  would like inform  headset compatible meta quest 2  
also got general reply  troubleshooting steps usb headphones  suppose  second reply one asking fill form refund  link website  https  returnsnarvarcomlogitechgreturns  refused  asked replacement  four days  still waiting reply  also  really like chorus  sounds really great   headset looks sounds like valve index  sort starting get used white noise  brain learns filter things  still unpleasant experience   s always weird one mentioned white noise  watched multiple reviews 
lower volume even s rma time  low volume  compared ear plugs  main concern chorus  s fine ambient sounds  walkabout mini golf  puzzling places   beat saber really need punch 
would really wierd way update firmware  dangerous  user disconnects power mid flashing  unless really resilient upgrade process 
re describing different  m experiencing thing op  s clear  loud hiss chorus entirely absent built speakers  s night day difference 
hahaha  one funniest  ridiculous things ve ever heard 
maybe issues device  usually increase 23 steps middle  s plenty loud  think tried max volume  s loud 
 https  wwwredditcomroculusquestcommentsxmsjlncommentis4e7rm  utmsourcereddit  utmmediumweb2x  context3   https  wwwredditcomroculusquestcommentsxmsjlncommentis4e7rm  utmsourcereddit  utmmediumweb2x  context3 
low volume  talking product  chorus speakers go extremely loud
think s today s industry standard two partitions  one currently running firmware second firmware uploaded  new firmware accepted  booted  cryptographic signature verified  yeah  pure speculation 
really much louder  hearing already much less sensitive   would explain hiss also much audible  maybe two devices calibrated differently  s annoying consumers nt control software devices 
re almost 1 cm away ears  press headstrap together hands chorus gets quite bit louder  low volume probably exaggerated  like said rythmmusic games s enough  loud club concert imho 
plugged chorus notebook unsurprisingly standard usb audio device  plus human interface device  likely  mute button    ubuntu leftright audio test   swapped 
would like see work way  nt think single device works way  everything gives  power  updating firmware  case lr issue probably s something simple  like oculus recognizing correctly  maybe quickfix applied oculus confirmationdrivers 
yeah  really bad  options  anything adjust anything  s  course  simple device  still  different volume levels  course  everyone perceives volume bit differently  course preference 
careful  much volume channeled directly eardrums certainly hurt hearing time  way re describing  sounds like like turning music way beyond safe listening levels  listen loud music typical sound system ears generally angled offaxis speakers  s distance listening position  case speakers directly facing ears within short distance 
interesting  need try see noise level different pc rather quest 
fwiw  eg  android  chromeos fuchsia devices update firmware way 
thanks warning  volume really loud max setting 
try 
nt actual usbc connect easily  back pc  unable actually test  also  nt think difference since usb port gives power volume control possibly 
used usbc extension cable  usb spec conformant  
yeah  nt adapter

nt noticed flopping weight battery das  kiwi definitely bulkier das heavier  often start velcro feels secure adapter snapped  far really thing stands better das volume level kiwi  quite bit louder  think preference leaning towards das

dont like idea killing ziggy  replacing inanimate object makes ziggy redundant  suggestion think others made  feed ziggy   ziggy charges  extract power  nt kill ziggy  causes ziggy poop  poop toxic product needs disposed  get keep ziggy 
ziggy s poop way go  think futurama
small team making vr space shooter  think star fox control full cockpit  power ship killing transforming small alien called ziggy fuel   ’ shared game see many think ziggy cute killed  thinking pacifist mode little alien replaced potato ziggy s harmed  would play mode  find info game   https  steampmapp1501820   https  steampmapp1501820 
 showed daughter said would play “ potato mode ”  ’ also likely play option  also also mentioned need ziggy merch  preferably plushy 
re right path  ve gathered backlash received last time around  lot people found ziggy killing mechanism gratuitous disturbing  yes  much better option  m sure people would like ziggy s spaceship pets company keep  space potatoes crystals whatever would indeed make much better energy generation mechanism 
could totally see preferring use potatoes  however  ’ still love find way make ziggy ’ useful  ’ pretty adorable would suck eye candy  maybe make useful adorable companions  could make cute sounds ’ close essential items questspecific goals  maybe sounds ’ low fuel need pay attention something resources ’ running low  basically  keep ziggy ’  killing them…
think idea knowingly exploiting innocent beings resources murdering sociopathic disturbing  yes  changed  would buy game  preferably mode  get rid mechanic altogether  poop idea people suggesting  alternatively  want explore morality exploiting ziggys  one option would conceal fact harvested  plot reveal  story player pursues end exploitation  perhaps ziggys little different looking  talk  occasionally gets flushed without explanation new different one appears  could metaphor society treats exploitable populations disposable “ ” 
still grew ziggy s  pooped potatoes
yes potato mode  nt want kill ziggy would dead space 
honestly    x200b  release already     x200b  wan na hang boy ziggy    x200b  s  wonderful day 
absolutely  looking forward game
play game without killing ziggy  mode build power cells 
looks sick
game looks great ’ wait play 
thought killing ziggies mechanic funny bit dark humor  ’ real  ’ gore anything  ’ really get people disturbed 
find something makes ziggy useful dont add
basically made poor ziggy totaly useless 
nt bend  stick vision  also bring game already m dying get hands 
’ ok killing ziggy also keeping 1 version ziggy entire game seems cool
get game 
making ziggy bit rare heart breaking use  like always access power potato use ziggy get 3x power boost another thing give ziggy gradual growth size game ’ getting impossible work around getting way small cockpit feel less bad putting blender bigger ziggy gives 15x times power

quest 2 audio volumepower increased recent update 
got quest 2 launch using pair koss headphones ever since  noticed month ago audio seemed bit louder   audio levels  put max level  bit quiet would ’ liked   ’ finding turning one notch audio level max seems increased  know recently quietly put graphics processing upgrade one updates  ’ wondering something similar audio  somehow increasing power outputvolume  anyone else noticed chalk personal thing  ’ complaining  like said  ’ always wished would little bit louder 
nt know actually updated also feel increased sound level
got steelseries artic 7p sound terrible quest 2
’ using wired quest 2 sounds quite almost like ’ miles away whatever game ’ playing  setting ’ missing ’ got volume wheel way well 
headphone cables seat correctly last 2mm  times  make sure re fully pushed

vr headset keeps making sound plugging in…
plug headset makes piano noise  strange keeps waking  please try help  nobody else problem last ditch plan 
seems like fir sone reason quest turned charging sound  hidden feature turned 
’ know anything suggested ’ work either try charging hallway nobody sleeps
s sound plays plug motorola phone must motorola something s probably software maybe go notifications sounds settings like charging sound cuz s works phone might headset
plugged pc 
sound headset makes plugged dw  since certain update started making sound confirm plugged 
based people saying reddit  s supposed charging status indicator sound  appears people implemented sound fucked  iphone also charging sound nt keep repeating sound million times charging like quest 2   people still common sense  called  bug  instead  feature  
quest 2 time  turn sound charges

abstract overwhelming audiovisual experience vr games like tetris effect  thumper  rez 
ve noticed three immersive vr games ve played quest 2  s nothing real life compare  hypnotic energy  anything else approach vr design  one think beat saber 
pistol whip 
experiences synth riders give awestruck feeling  feeling power  like conducting universe  song amazing  one addon packs 5 6 experiences packs  wow one  found video  tbh  falls far short real thing  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vro6exdzub3e
s pcvr  polybius feels literally designed make sick  loooove  😅 made jeff minter  infamous shroomloving game developer 
ca nt think anything quite exceptional rez  thumper tetris  use concept synesthesia works really well vr  guess closest synth riders  particular dediceated  experience  songs available separate purchases 
game  pretty cool visual aural experience completely free  cosmic flow applab https  wwwoculuscomexperiencesquest3872076276162726
would recommend audiotrip pistolwhip  also give solid workout
couple years ago ve developing experience  got vicious loop constant shifting one concept another could nt finish game  moment applab ve sure even pass quest store review process  basic idea experience orbiting around planets capturing music notes revive   concept art   https  megasonicuzimgsoundspacejpg   early demo game re interested could share 
maybe check arkade applab  s rhythmpuzzle game like ones ve mentioned found fairly hypnotic retrotron look takes immersive  unreal place  end intensity scale game like daedalus feels otherworldly immersive strange chilledout way  like trapped weird cubist work art 
avicii invector  s basically knockoff old harmonix amplitudefrequency s good rhythm game pretty great music decent backgrounds 
 deleted 
yeah  another vote polybius moose life  fit op s criteria  perfectly   let s hope get native quest version one day 
moose life another minter game s trip vr  flow state rivals anything op mentioned 
 early demo game re interested could share  specific reason nt consider releasing early demo sidequest gauge interest 
rsi 
gon na mention one  s pretty tame compared polybius  minotaur arcade vol 1 also favorite remake gridrunner s also playable vr  jeff minterllamasoft game vr support worth  re perfectly playable regular screen 
agree  could drop demo sidequest  think kinda shy release even demo felt unfinished  nowadays try fix  ve started early discussions subreddit ve received  negative   https  wwwredditcomroculusquestcommentswjzh4mwouldyouplayamixofwordgameandvrshooter   positive   https  wwwredditcomroculusquestcommentswe7ot4wouldyouplayvrshootergamesetinwildwest  feedback  feedback helps lot ve also found people interested testing early prototypes moves us forward

road rash vr  prototype  turn sound 🔊 
""
cool idea definitely nt skills something similar nt take comment wrong way  ridden motorcycle  corner like especially speed  nt turn handlebars  lean bike  fact speed actually put pressure bar opposite direction lean bike s counter d expect  something consider  feedback still think s really cool idea 
d tone bike punching face going speed zones  looks cool though 
want make road rash vr  recommend playing road rash first  zero elements seen harken back series outside unrealistic combat went realistic digitized look la 90s need speed  usually long stages instead looped racing tracks  maybe extreme g would work supposed inspiration given suspended tracks boost pads  made way faster    https  youtubemhkeipvayki   https  youtubemhkeipvayki  even eventually add melees would resemble something like sega s motor raid  style  quality  nothing trumps sega s arcade games design fun  instead   https  youtubefsiszsk54qc   https  youtubefsiszsk54qc 
road rash  nt see single kick punch head  disappointment  
nice see bends loops  vr racing boring flat tracks  going faster  seems slow atm   could turn extremeg wipeout game  
looking great far  good motorcycle  dirt bike vr games done right could big hit  ideas think might helpful although realize still beginning stages theses probably real far  1  back triggers work front back brakes  believe front brake usually left back brake usually right  could even corresponding physics  example pull front brake going fast fly forward  depending speed hard ’ gripped  real life would either fly handle bars  nose wheely slow added speed wobbles  brings  2  2  real life  faster go motorcycle harder control  might already  ’ tell really video  slow turns would something important make seem realistic  3  maybe dirt bike option well woods motocross type track including jumps  whoops  etc  know still beginning stages ’ thought  game looks great  ’ wait play see ends 
dang dude need dial  ride motorcycle  bit way crank kicking  clubbing whipping people death chains part  ve got  stunts   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  vhkk4gvos0  pretty good though 
think know  bars 2 wheeled vehicle barely turn re speed  looks cool hell though  perspective knowing nothing making games least 
nothing like road rash 
want like roadrash highly suggest getting rid ideas  tracks  least tracks lap  sort complex track design   roadrash always looooong stretches country highway roads  focus combat actual  racing   others mentioned physics bikes  m stickler especially game like roadrash nt need even want realistic handling 
know road road rash nt speed boosts right 
loop loop
download 
increase turn rate less turning handlebars
far reminds excite bike 
could remake sw pod racers vr would awesome
hi  op  nt complete loop da loop  m happy  please next time
giving real lego island vibes  pretty cool seem far immersive vr racers 
cool 
turning bike combination leaning handlebars
thats u turn bike
steering wrong  turn left go right motorcycle speed slow creep 
instead turning implement lean feature make realistic 
like stunts motorbike   beyond seeing road rash influence ’ nice work progress work 
first thing noticed also  op  great concept  want add realism riding mechanics  look “ countersteering ” utilized turn motorcycle  like previous user said  turn motorcycle actually turn bars opposite direction turn lean bike direction turn  awesome job far 
 cool idea definitely nt skills something similar nt take comment wrong way  ridden motorcycle  corner like especially speed  nt turn handlebars  lean bike  fact speed actually put pressure bar opposite direction lean bike s counter d expect    something consider  feedback still think s really cool idea  real gentleman  read something like people less politeness  yeah  countersteering great  remember still punch pilots   think gameplay arcade possible  think 
fun fact  force applied gyroscope applied 90 degrees direction rotation  ’ applying force feels like opposite direction actually pushes bottom tire leans bike 
s debug track  logic  physics works well crazy track  urban track large ways work even better 
wait
front brake controlled right lever  rear brake controlled right foot pedal  left lever controls clutch  left foot controls shifter  turning bars speed first gear bad results  bikes much better cornering higher speeds cars  yeah level going fast corner bad results  find safe speed start  maintain speed corner  apex accelerate desire 
thoughts entirely
yes   road rash jailbreak nitro  s almost  haha
soon 
could always change design pretend hover bike something doesnt turn like amotorcycle
think point motorcycles lean bike high speed versus turn handlebars  would nt worry countersteering think using example actually ride  low speeds  like parking lot speed  might turn handle bars pronounced  however want  feel  like motorcycle re going want change controls  lean  rather  steer   would still allow free hand combat
adding punching whatever cant save bad mechanics  bike rider  would nt play vr bike fails emulate reality 
yeah  came suggest less like road rash like jetmoto  looks like game lot fun  s game nt quite fit branding 
agree sentiment  head position control bike leans  left right turning  front back pitch  nt see wheelies  boosts dont count  s quite motorbike game yet imo  lol 
played much vr  s often reality comes controls

behave headphones bluetooth yes   people said audio bluetooth quest 2 little laggy games  ’ never tried 
problem bt audio gaming general latency  audio delayed  solution aptx low latency   receiver transmitter need support standard  unfortunately q2 support  however  possible u use external usb bt transmitter support aptx ur quest  compatible though  hearing aid ur dad need aptx support  ive experience 
huge latency using bluetooth headphones q2  unusable 
thanks much replys  ll pass info along  look headphones work good hearing aids 
tried quest psvr wired due lag lack 3d audio bluetooth 
confirm 2 separate bluettoth audio devices q2 bluetooth 1 second delay sound 
unfortunately low latency codec  llc  quest 2 use  something imagine hearing aids hearing important balance  pair  audio probably good 200 ms behind notice delay
actually use bluetooth headphones quest 2 times  games audio nt important  things like fishing  golf tetris  watching movies works well  shooters move around spatial audio horrible bluetooth latency though  really mess head turn   rhythm based games like beat saber flat unplayable 
quest 2 bluetooth headphones  pairing  audio lag workaround https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v2oelhxhxhow

games make challenging mute
’ prefer dedicated “ push speak ” controller  passes audio needed 
would love one controller  actually  double tapping oculus button muteunmute would absolute best option imo

’ suspicious  ’ virtual audio driver needed oculus desktop software  windows struggles manage audio devices times

realtek audio card  also  try using audio switcher audioswitcher  stupid domain name  know   started using year ago various audio devices actually started consistent 
right click sound icon system tray bottom right  click sound settings  sound settings click sound control panel  right click disable oculus virtual audio device 
suspicious  would possibility gain making windows audio go driver device even connect 
self favour  go microsoft store download eartrumpet  oculus audio device problem long program made everything easier solve lot bearable
mine similar thing  would rapidly  like 20 times second  switch oculus audio actual audio device point could nt switch audio device going crazy  would eventually stop 5 minutes audio computer  sure fixed stop one day 
right click speaker icon taskbar open sounds   go playback  tab scroll oculus  right click select disable   make sure playback device want use enabled  windows struggles different audio devices  keep one enabled using time works great 
ca nt happens s drop menu anymore  disable reenable default audio driver get back 
proper fix running windows ’ sound troubleshooter  search something like fix sound audio issues start menu  also fixes  start cancel without asking fix anything  may slightly easier disabling reenabling device 
mine thing 
need simple way fix  go audio settings clicking little arrow next audio bar little bottom menu  choose audio  lazy read comments  sorry ve already fixed 
crap  ended breaking every bluetooth 24 spectrum device pc  constant disconnects  persistent driver awful  oculus app basically malware  quest 2 standalone great  comes windows team really needs hire decent programmers  spent month  way fix 100  wipe windows  even uninstalling ’ help  leaves garbage system keep breaking hid compliant devices  register level

happening  defaulting oculus speaker microphone  zoom meetings could nt hear speak  go settings switch default communication devices 
disable oculus microphone device windows kept getting defaulted skype  even though nt defaulted windows  speakers never issue 
oculus tray tool  https  apollyonvrwixsitecomvrtoolsoculustraytool  might help  allows automatically switch back proper audio driver  stop oculus service whenever quit oculus app  features like perapp supersampling 
go sound control panel change default device

good know  ca nt even switch normal audio drop menu till disable reenable audio driver  completely gone  fix  live 
tryed keeps coming back still remains default
audio nvidia 2070 
prevent working air link 
sounds like normal audio device malfunctioning way windows “ helpfully ” switching devices  maybe check event viewer see audio related errors 
interesting  xbox controller started randomly disconnecting roughly around time got oculus  never thought could related
thats normal  never problem switching 
use program called eartrumpet bounce audio sources  occasionally oculus app gets stuck audio driver  app lets quickly switch back regular desktop audio  original reason getting quickly bounce headphones  games  desktop speakers  general windows audio  worked well oculus  goofy software well 
case  ’ windows  ’ oculus app  ’ poorly programmed using things like persistent hid polling  depending build windows audio chipset system uses  ’ either going work break everything  refuse remove audio card use oculus ’ know write software lol
right click little speaker bottom right taskbalk  open sound settings  click manage sound devices  moght called slightly diffrent  pc dutch   left click oculus speaker click disable  know want stream sound q2 pc manually enable q2 headphone  basically steps yiu click enable instead disable 
’ output  audio assuredly something else  find device manager usually 
said hopefully work prevent hearing audio use airlink

randomly week  computer go sleep mode turn back audio anything  oculus software nt either 
thanks man  ll check
2070 output audio monitor via hdmi dp  monitors 35mm minimum  triggering pc sleeps  probably 2070 triggering sleep pc default disconnects monitors  trigger sleep mode monitors   would turn deactivate audio device provided hdmidp cause default next device  oculus audio  pc wakes sleep  ideally would swap audio devices back  bunch quriks nvidia driver means nt always recreate monitoraudio output identity  windows fails reattach 
think ’ enable next time use airlink
tried setting audio component default source  also tried updating drivers 
try renaming  another device put list
ve tried updating drivers yes  try setting default audio get back 
good luck 
working vr motorbike game  prototype  turn sound 🔊

nt forget add enough texture sides simulate speed  many games feel slow cause nothing moves background
steering wheel replaced handlebar  promise 
looks like got good physics  also feels like one songs feel like ’ heard million times fact never heard 
motion sickness getting motion sickness
m consistently disappointed nt good motorcycle racing games s perfect game vr turn10 studios fuck making ride vr
know arcade motorcycle game rig  would awesome setup

m disappointed nt loop da loop otherwise looks good

accidentally create rocket league vr  saw rocket car
looks awesome  side quest  unavailable public  alpha test would interested playing
looks good  quest missing good native racing game  thats first person  besided fact probably isnt final bike model  im liking  thing im lukewarm bike kicking upwards going boost  maybe flash around edge screen  seems like would pull experience  2 cents
oh fuck yes also things feel little slow  adding stuff like motion blur  dont see   speed lineswind lines  changing fov  things like camera shake  small  much make sick  help make speed 
make sure get  counter  steering right  ie  turning left initiates lean right  causes turn right  turn left  go left  nt made motorbike game  ve made car game 
good cause s messing looks promising tho  long working
 looks like got good physics  also feels like one songs feel like ’ heard million times fact never heard  already played road rush jailbreak  listened song past 
following great interest ready throw money looks promising
maybe road rush 
forgot put nitro boost right loop  sorry 
awesome game 
omg  s true 
 looks awesome  side quest  unavailable public  alpha test would interested playing yes  s quest  nt share videos pc think fair pay game  m nintendo guy  trailers game engine  cutscenes prerendered 
came say  get double digits mph speeds  bikes steer wrong  way 
s crucial difference simulation arcade games  could visually mimic countersteering motion remain arcade game  motion quite slight hardly visible  head tracking allows interesting simulation bits though  could steer actual hands  would hard without force feedback ears giving feedback   countersteer  sticks nt always work well  s effectively relative motion  bike  righting  depending front wheel geometry  ca nt hold stick max right  could go max right scrapes hold slightly less max hold turn  could also tie rider s body bike forcing tilt head maintain level view horizon  horrible ears would still report head tilted  might better force tilt hands maintain level horizon  tracking accuracy could spoil experience  somewhat doable one force heads move relative hands  ie  want get max turn rate need lean turn   really hard explain   hope made sense 
couple weeks  already sended prototype controlling bike using analog sticks couple months ago 
aha  ’ good possibility loved road rash games  maybe ’ buried somewhere deep inside brain 
start moving bikes steer wrong way 
good points  weight shifting  via head movement  could interesting thing play around  without actual forcefeedback handlebars countersteering would hard simulate  wonder something could done motion controllers attached ends section broomstick    make quadbike game  get handlebars  without complicated steering dynamics  motorcycle game ve played actually made attempt correct steering dynamics manx tt  arcade game 90s 
cool  long worked game engines  personal project work studio  either way looks promising need tester m interested

hey guys  m frustrated  using usb 30 cable oculus quest 2 games run great  sound totally weird via steam vr  seconds s fine soon sounds appear sound gives kind jerky crackling sound    x200b  ive searched forums saw many people problem back 2021 one realy fix worked  ive already tried go beta oculus back nothing worked  tried reduce windows sounds 50 still crackling sound  also tried others usb ports  problem still occurse  everything outside steam vr working great case sounds    x200b  maybe youll fix  would great  thanks everybody 
’ thing happens powerful pcs think play h3vr vr crackles sound sometimes  dont think fix  probably  definitely wrong also make sure usb 30 cable plugged usb slot  idk helps make sure
sound ’ engineered right  putting two sounds together cause crackling
rtx3060 12 gb i7 processor  36 gb ram didnt mentioned played morning bit didnt happened  tried boom
none helps ’ probably app specific bug  steam
think ’ steam vr thing  happens sometimes ’  guess games powerful run makes crackling sound  games detailed graphics lot objects map something like plus loading sound playing time makes crackling probably

software would recommend view custom 3d model video textures include sound  twinmotion unity drawbacks  maybe mozilla hub 
ve tried twinmotion video textures userfriendly interface work well  ca nt synced audio video textures  unity option  nt know much coding seems lot involved  mozilla hub allow custom models custom video textures  options nondeveloper 
3d model video textures  example 
unity easy learn  far easier blender  ’ 90 billion tutorials youtube  sorry  wrong number  wanted accurate  checked  ’ actually 90 trillion 
lot video installations  sometimes large scale projection different shaped screens  ll usually mock room screen   3ds max blender make material screen geometry video playing uv mapped texture  rather still image   helps us visualize media space  rendering either programs helpful  able see vr would even better  ve succeeded twinmotion  sound 
haha  easy  maybe  blender easy coming 3d animation background  unity whole different animal  actually strategy session couple years ago lot designers animators expressed interest learning unity help seamless integration developers   attempts  reality s quick everyone xd

quiero empezar hacer gameplays por diversión  pero sé cómo arreglar el audio
pues eso mis hermanos  inicie este pasatiempo  jugar principalmente juegos de psone subir los videos comentados youtube  100  con animo de hacerlo como pasatiempo  mi problema es que se que hacer con el audio  se escucha la silla cuando cruje se mueve  veo que otros les pasa  asi que supongo estoy ignorando lo mas basico de edicion de audio  alguno lanza una direccion  como empezar  datos que importan  tengo un mic genesis radium 600 studio usb cardioide acepto humildemente cualquier ayuda  comentario consejo  saludos
necesitas un buen micrófono  con ganancia ajustable para que solo te tome la voz lo menos posible del ruido ambiente luego hay software que te ayuda eliminar ruido ambiente  como para hacer un pase en post lamentablemente si haces ruido el micrófono de una u otra forma lo va levantar
mira yo también hago lo que vos haces  grabo las pistas por separado  pista 1 pc pista 2 micrófono entonces la pista 2 la meto en un editor de audio  ahí le podés eliminar los ruidos mejorar tu voz  para después cuando unas todo lo edites  tenés mejor calidad en la voz  en el editor de video podrías bajar el sonido la pc aumentar el de tu mic  fíjate jugá con esas opciones  tanto del editor de audio como de video
hola yo conozco del tema pero podrías bajar el volumen de grabación hablar más fuerte  por q también vienen eliminadores de ruido en el driver de sonido pero hacen como q tu voz suene digital veces  si averiguaré de micrófonos que tengo entendido que están los q se llaman condensadores q toman todo el sonido los direccionales q toman solo el sonido en una direccion

el tema del sonido siempre siempre es complicado
fijate en el windows  con algunas mothers viene la realtek audio console que sirve para eliminar muchos de esos problemas
alguna solución para audio prototype 1
verán el juego va perfecto todo pero el audio se escucha bajísimo sé si alguien alguna vez jugo juega este hermoso juego si alguien sabe la solución se lo agradecería ya que se escucha casi nada
si tu juego es legal en steam utiliza el foro del juego comentalo en ingles te van ayudar mejor al problema que estas teniendo puede que tengas problemas si el chip es realtek ese chip es como que odia los juegos en general siempre hay algun problema le agarra 
si mal recuerdo anda en punto de encuentro del juego busca guia parece que tenian un mods un arreglo los de la comunidad
se pero que juegazo
amigo tenés q configurar el audio de la pc en calidad de 48000hz calidad cd  yo la verdad note diferencia pero eso soluciona lo del prototype  busca en youtube lo explican bien
pero el tema de los otros juegos les afecta cambiar la configuración de audio  también youtube esas cosas le afecta
