one workaround connect headphone cable headset run pogo pins speaker  thus bypassing broken flex cable  maybe solder cable copper tape slid pogo pins contacts  either way  diy territory  easy fix 
1 repair shops could  electronically simple  replacing exact wire like like might hard get part 2 may  fairly simple  buy tools could cost much repair shop  d tools skill afterwards  fix  future  3 work around like uredditor10700 said
definitely fixable  fixable depends skill willingness break 
idk much right tools expertise probably  idk though  probably needs like expert something  could also maybe use bluetooth headphones headphones really long cable headset still otherwise works

still nt understand compagnies releasing vr headset without freaking 35mm headphones jack  feel spoiled vive use whatever headphones want 
reading links  still nt quite get  get audio headset txrx box  pcvr  basically s creating second wireless link dedicated audio  would sync video 
alternatively  find  analog  wireless headphones  nt much latency

replicate surround sound vr front facing speakers 
listed title says  im much audio tech person  get tired wires tangling headphones vr headset audio kinda crappy  thats im resorting option  know works normal desktop games surround sound speakers  however vr  directions get mixed im seated mode pivoting around chair  need help resolving issue  please thanks 
ca nt  surround sound works flat game monitor always forward  vr headset  though  turn head freely changes direction forward s way game know orientation sound system compensate  vr relies wearing headset speakers rotate head left always left right always right 
choices vr headset headphones  maybe‚Ä¶  maybe could get away speakers placed around room long never moved‚Ä¶  ‚Äô think solution exists would reorient sound surround based direction ‚Äô facing  would real niche software haha 
need speakers move ears s possible without earphones  however wireless headphones could use 
afaik s possible speakers front  unless never move  ksc75 work pretty well vr headset headphones though  lightweight never touch cable playing vr  used twisttie shorten length   alternatively could get wireless headphones  preferably nonbluetooth delay  connect computer  generic gaming headphones steelserieslogitech work fine 
headphones  koss porta pros 
good bluetooth  50 later  pc  ve heard actually use wireless earbuds pretty well without laggy  altho nt tried nt know sure  wire bothers much wireless ones try  otherwise personally use wired earbuds run cable thru back headset strap keeps wire completely way  never touch  edit  tried wireless sony wf1000xm4s pc  supports bluetooth 51 eh  still feel latency  especially rhythm games like beat saber pistol whip  games  idk  maybe could tolerate  definitely feel  personally still prefer wired  nt play games like beat saber  maybe could worth trying wireless extra comfort  altho  get full sized gaming headphones basically latency  gaming headphones come usb dongle  extreme low latency nt use bluetooth  audeze released maxwell ve heard s incredible   300 tho  idk budget  otherwise cheaper solid options 
use earbuds headphones help 
think may also depend supported audio codec  sony wf1000xm4 seem support aptx lhdc  low latency codec variants  see https  headphonesaddictcombluetoothcodecs

would require manual calibration  speakers attached player s head  left right easy determine surround sound system  left right almost certainly going orientation player ingame  re watching someone play  mirror audio  wo nt get spacial audio effect s super important social setting  anyway 
people still nt give shit proper audio  sadly
problem surround sound systems nt work hrtfs  fundamental vr audio works stereo  d entirely redesign audio system even  prerecorded binaural audio clips would never sound 100  right  huge problem surround sound designed give optimal listening experience listener center head fixed height account pitch yaw head  vr system know surround sound speakers would order output correct sounding audio  top system make happen would several times complex resource heavy due fact account speakers somehow compensate fact speakers fixed height yet head position vr  nt enough  d also need room surround sound system vr playspace surround sound systems need space sound propagate  sweaty ears issues solved  get valve index issue  vr designed around attached stereo audio s best solution medium 
see comment left  agree current surround sound systems nt suited vr  really gaming general   best results  would place eight identical speakers arranged symmetrically around listener effective surround sound  probably another eight height layer overhead channel full immersion  positioning content left right channels irrelevant audio 100  positional  guess re saying biggest challenge provide consistent acoustic experience matter way re facing 
 left right  simplified way refer orientation surround sound system s extremely relevant  surround sound system s orientation nt going player s  player moving around  turning roomscale  snapturning  etc  order game output positional audio surround sound system  would need know orientation system regard player  example  player enemy left  headphones plays audio left speaker  left always left  surround sound system  player facing toward tv  left left  re facing away tv  left right  player facing 45 degrees away tv left  left 50  left 50  rear  etc  without knowing surround sound system oriented  game way knowing channels output 
blown away vr oculus rift cv1 2017  2 years  upgraded valve index  felt like huge leap forward  fov  resolution  refresh rate  audio   controllers    almost 4 years later  headset leap forward  controls  audio  weight  fov 
ve looking seem like every headset market compromise way  valve index actually heavier oculus rift cv1  bother  definitely nt want go heavier  ruling heavier headset  anyone something beats index fov  144hz refresh rate  resolution  good displayport connectivity  desktoppc user   solid steamvr compatibility  s okay nt beat controllers  long keep using valve index controllers vive body trackers steamvr  keep looking looking ca nt find anything nt suck way  bought hp reverb g2  felt like cheap index weird required microsoft setup software low fov resold  m picky sure  re going 4 years later  must true superior index right 
 psvr2 likely closest buy ps5 along headset lot limited games 
keep enjoying index  s first rtx 3090 could start enjoy 90  144 hz using high res  steamvr 200  500   awesome image quality  still need even faster gpu demanding games like green hell vr  hubris looks even better using res 300  150200   ll need rtx 4090  rtx 5090 144 hz  lol   2022  tom s hardware  roadtovr cnn said index still king  early 2023 cnn wrote index still king pcvr  https  ampcnncomcnncnnunderscoredreviewsbestvrheadset supplement index  bought ps5  added 4tb nvme preordered psvr2 
index still mostly ahead industry average besides clarity  pimax crystal give u clarity plus wigig wireless post launch  u use steam light houses index controllers optional steamvr face plate  plus eye tracking possibly next popular vr gizmo seems like s next thing  s quite yet s close 
psvr 2 coming next month ps5
sadly s true successor index  innovations vr since cheaper  lightweight  standalone  convenient wireless headsets inferior specs  rather pushing specs wired base station headsets  ve got prosumer headsets like pimax  varjo aero  etc  re  complete package  like index 
call dumb ‚Äô really itching get meganex  really really want oled hdr  ‚Äô fine keeping knuckles lighthouses tracking control  higher res  actual blacks  insane contrast  ever since got lg c1 realized oled fluke  ‚Äô big difference movies shows  ‚Äô even close going back lcd even qled  seen realize much better  plus hdr actually looks like ‚Äô looking window  ‚Äô flatscreen tv  ‚Äô imagine ‚Äô like vr without sde  must insanely immersive   got pretty disheartened ces year saying meganex got warping issues  raised price   ‚Äô overall mature product yet  wait people reviewed final product  still kinda stupidly considering ordering one soon ‚Äô available anyway heh  feel free talk 
move sideways try wireless headset 
quest 3 likely represent best value qualities desire  pimax untrustworthy  would nt consider contender  technical victory belongs htc vive pro 2  guess  least upgrade path wireless  top advantages similarly upgradable headsets like index  fact something one actually buy right helps standing 
situation  curiosity bought pico 4 first never intended use main vr hmd  quickly  could nt stand index s panel resolution longer comparison pico 4 s optics panels  virtual desktop shocking good job wireless vr  index sold ebay  feature lost single finger tracking pressure sensing controllers  logitech chorus near field speakers modded pico  even better sound index  bandwidth aka bass   got mobile option top  super light weight balanced hmd  however  kept index controllers lighthouse emitters  case valve s next hmd index back days  vr evolution 
pimax crystal  2880x2880 per eye  1100 dimming zones per eye miniled displays  160hz  110¬∞ horizontal fov  eye tracking foveated rendering  compatible base stations index controllers 
re boat  difference started rift  skipped valve index due issues  sold quest 2 week ebay  ve researching replacementupdgrade months  unfortunately  people like us sol moment  pcvr seems dead  development shifted standalone  s profits  sad true  currently m back ultrawide flat gaming  thinking  pico 4   least s better pcvr  quest 2  
look ‚Äô said   pimax crystal   ‚Ä¶ ‚Äô got rubbing chin whiskers 
 headsets like varjo xr3  enterprise focused   5000   1500yr software  someone played alyx using  experience nt smooth index due weird stuff achieve retinal  resolution  off brand  headsets lots tradeoffs  commentors revealed   best headset right  controllers  honestly quest pro  a beef meta  b willing pay  1200  s worthy upgrade index  quite  1200 worth upgrade  psvr2 looks amazing  though limited sony hardware  htc s new  1100 headset looks like another quest pro contender  quest pro controllers appear better ergo tracking 
impressed pimax crystal specs  looks like s really highly priced headset without diopter adjustment coming year  nt face tracking builtin  heavier  nt mind buying addons  especially really come solid face tracking diopter adjustment addon options  weight addons functionality  would say way heavy  m also unsure weight reported without steamvr face plate  would mean even  valve index big compromise heavy  even cable mounted ceiling  weight really something wanted get   reduced   increased  rift cv1 light  feel like ll always chasing feeling  pimax company also seems real dicey   faq section   https  pimaxcomcrystal  crystal full broken english  m knocking people struggle english  know s difficult language master  company publishing page publicly  basic spelling grammar checking says  nt care englishspeakers much   nt really want secondclass citizen eyes company get  1600  stanalone  headset  valve support good  even warranty expired  nt think could handle switching company cares little  seem true  people trying get issues resolved  reported poor communication  shipping slowness  apparently amd gpus  still   officially supported  s probably something big bold red letters  bad look expensive  supposedly premium headset people suggesting buy index replacement  would nt want shut door possibility going amd future  competition gpu manufacturers something definitely want encourage   1600 headset officially supports nvidia gpus  essentially preventing going amd  would hard pass  know people support forums report work select amd gpus  s really rocky territory  would rather stick companies proper testing list amd nvidia approved gpus 
gon na talk  definitely wait reviews putting money
also pretty interested meganex  last year ces looked promising even bad news like raised costsprice postponed release still hope  news shortly feedback present ces unfortunately almost lost interest  warping issues likely get solved otherbetter lenses  still strange got worse year changing first place  lower costs  larger fov  higher brightness   knows  biggest bummer though kinda unofficially ditching insideout tracking  m interested lighthouse headset would willing paying  1500 decent pcvr headset specs meganex needs insideout tracking controllers questpico level  feel pain regarding display technology  first headset rift cv1 second quest 2 oled still biggest thing miss would say even important immersion flatscreen  3d effectdepth perception much better  colors blacks also improve feeling virtual worlds  second would audio workarounds like mods 3rd party accessoires 
vive pro 2 still fresnel lenses though  according reviews user feedback one worst terms glare  low vertical fov small binocular overlap 
 logitech chorus install pico 4  difficult  mod destructive reversible 
controllers pico  heard tracking okay  im running quest 2 pro controllers use airlink steamvr  would love pancake lenses quest 2 great clarity  im happy  next headset quest 3 assumption pro controllers work well 
ll keep eye  maybe pimax crystal 2 knock weight raise fov  plus add diopter adjustment would really expect builtin  least premiumpriced headset 2023 
think many vr enthusiasts come similar conclusion  sine meta stepped  ‚Äô bit race bottom little action high end  rumored deckard might come year  next year never  ‚Äô think makes sense delay headset purchase hopes release soon  varjo areo ‚Äô seem make sense cost pimax crystal coming  interesting things ces ‚Äô likely least 18 months away new players  psvr2 seems cool without pc modding scene along racing flight sims  ‚Äô point  hate admit ‚Äô less valve makes big announcement soon  pimax really last hope enthusiast pcvr  reviews continue positive ‚Äô probably pick one since 4090 power  goes well maybe ‚Äô make jump 12k  really ‚Äô see option rekindle wow factor spoke  also went cv1 index   like though ‚Äô super concerned pimax  go subreddit read bizarre work arounds get headsets working  ‚Äô sure gotten better hate tech ‚Äô always issue troubleshoot  keep going back option  question weight face plate add pimax  understanding additional weight originally reported  reviewers already said ‚Äô heavy  additional front weight definitely concern 
s two large velcro straps  easy 
tracking working perfectly  insideout standards   certain advantages arc design  ca nt block held one behind front 
pimax crystal 2  re clearly rush impressed  d happy pimax crystal releases already 
pimax crystal 1 released yet  calm 
 bizarre work arounds get headsets working ve reading lot post history subreddit  apparently products issues specific certain games  really interesting  sounds like developers failed test high resolutions  probably nt test hardware   game weird things like displaying full resolution one pimax headset eye  blurrylowres  m sure fault lies devs partly  m also betting pimax nt communicative intouch devs games  know people work big vr games social experiences  actually get discounted  early even free hardware offerings big manufacturers like htc  companies want sure games devs support hardware  like face tracking  something preparetest  could nt say reason   pimax nt maintaining relationships game devs outside home country similar capacity  might big reason people many weird issues  s really difficult push past take risk brand   additional weight originally reported probably gon na hold see comes next htc valve case  ca nt imagine something significantly heavier index comfortable enough play long periods 
nice  im glad hear tracking working well  controller design interesting  one complaint quest 2 original controllers  things would get little wonky shooting games fast past rythm games occlusion would occur rings getting close together  quest pro controllers completely solved issue hefty price 
well still compromises  s bigger heavier  lacking diopter adjustment found cheaper headsets releasing year  people reviewing noted added clarity high resolution comes persistence issuesghosting screen  company also seems poor communicating  least westerners   often resulting confusion features included launch  addons   case pimax crystal  looks like much confusion face tracking diopter adjustment  makes wonder would get good support  based pimax help posts  especially hardware failures   possible  get support first year  difficult slow  valve really good responsive helping index  matter issue  even warranty  would really rather stick company nt pimax looking

best audio mods quest 2 elite strap
personally think quest 2s speakers actually really good problem speakers arent ur ear would proper headphones hence sounds bit washed accessory traps audio better something like cuz find audio way better use hoodie something trap sound
koss ksc 75 3d print mounts 
sony headphones 3d printed mount
vr ears sound decent burn  nt touch ears  s good index audio solution  s lot better tiny speakers imagine really good 
audio keeps cutting left ear valve index 
would vr ears rebuff reality solve issue 
would check rvalveindex iirc tighten screws ear piece fix issue s loose connection otherwise s probably cable 
loosen screws  take  clean contacts  put back  problem solved 
clean contacts  every move make audio cuts xd
electrical contact cleaner  might necessary  brush first  nt use canned air  ll make worse 
screws coming loose common enough problem  d try tighten first breaking cleaning stuff  every 6 months tighten left ear screw

headset died last year first thought cable communicated customer service even years past warranty sent new one  nt work  asked send headset back sent new one one cable  m still using first cable broken 2 spare sitting drawer 
m also eu 4 year old hmd replaced  time  eulaw nt anything anymore  eu protection lasts 2 years  though countries longer   nice thing  would guess consumer satisfaction
yep  eu uk far longer warranties us   live uk  someone us call liar told ipad fixed warranty 20 months due faulty battery without applecare
would bet australia
thank  üôè
ended buying spare headphone ebay  35 s worked perfectly  still original one ca nt figure one would go taking apart without breaking

mine well
amazon  nt helping either rift became longer available  sigh  audio issue actually well known  caused easily torn ribbon cable  oculus wo nt sell part 
seriously  mine broke year warranty flat refused send replacement  even offer sell one  ve tried several times contact support 2 years something warranty  got nothing

need better fix poor audio rift setup heavy 
""
get lighter headphones ear buds
check koss porta pro
could probably get rabbit hole chinese iem s  re looking great value 
check deluxe audio strap  helps balance front heavy weight 
use fairly decent set earbuds  look amazon read reviews  get sorted less ¬£50 
use airpods 
koss ksc75  half decent iem kz
‚Äô quest 2 simpler point 
nt aux port rift 
might get earbuds hook around back ear use  weigh basically nothing  think  rift headphone jack 
good ones know 
 re better oculus sound

50 pounds earbuds seems kinda much nt 
quest 2 rma right also thing terrible audio well ‚Äô oculus thing guess
would nt change anything  quest 2 crappy inband speakers rift need use headphones get proper sound  op mentioned cumbersome use  next oculus headset really needs proper headphones like rift cv1 used like ones valve index  fiddle external headphones addition headset pain ass 
ah well case get one aux cable extenders tape cable rift s cable 
yeah tried using jack well  makes cable drag worse  iem ‚Äô sound poo poo
use wireless logitech g pro x headset rift s sits good fit right halo fairly light 
interesting statement  koss porta pro beats builtin tweeters rift miles  quality jump audio quality like day night  sure headphones actually touch ears  look like  https  wwwredditcomroculuscommentscfk7ybtheeasiestandimobestriftsheadphonemod  google pictures 
oasis good video  used heavy duty velcro hold  https  youtube2tyzvhgz0a
say  less  ¬£50   look ll likely bag good pair ¬£25  read reviews 
use deluxe audio strap quest 2  tho got launch  better options 
toatal bill fix 20

deluxe audio strap  popping  right ear move suddenly
whenever m playing game requires fast head movements  thrill fight mostly   right ear  pop  head click back outward position  ve read threads suggest tightening screws nothing make swiveling ear piece forward back tighter  ve also tried bending ear piece outwards  anything since head size never issue  seems issue momentum quick movements causes  lock  come ear piece pops  happen left ear  anyone know fix strapping ear piece velcro zip tie

got sony 3d pulse headphones  use audio jack get best sound vr 
thought ‚Äô try since heard ear headphones better immersion  like way look  downside using audio jack little cumbersome  use dongle goes system   get right audio experience needs coming vr goggles  edit  wanted clarify ‚Äô using psvr2  1
psvr  need use audio jack headset  psvr2  use wireless dongle 
‚Äô using wireless dongle 3d pulse headphones simultaneously using psvr2  sounds great  totally sync visuals  Ôøº
use jack mine s spotty wifi headset audio output either way  get full 3d audio either way
get  slightly  better audio quality wireless dongle wired 35mm jack  ‚Äô dongle makes ps5 recognize ‚Äô device ready optimized gamespecific 3d audio  wire  ‚Äô regular pair stereo headphones 
go wireless unless m using racing wheel  case nt enough usb ports  wired wireless 100 
wireless way  ‚Äô debate whether put dongle front  build heat cause dropouts back  must admit  helped wireless dropouts lot  could entirely coincidence placebo effect üòÇ
use jack dont plug dongle  want usb port free plug steering wheel 
sure vr specifically  looking reviews headset  wired controller provided slightly ‚Äú better ‚Äù mic quality  ‚Äô using dongle though ‚Äô fine  vr andor otherwise
thanks  clarified  ‚Äô using psvr 2  ‚Äô good know use dongle
s weird  psvr1 nt forced plug headphone jack experience 3d audio  earphones come psvr2  3d right 
false  get full 3d audio headset supports via jack  spoiler alert pulse headset support
nt forget usb back ps5 dongle wireless headphones 
definitely get hot  use usb extension move away console stop sound dropping 
always get extender cheap pull away system needed 
spoiler alert‚Ä¶ every pair wired headphones ever able 3d audio  ps5 decoding  wireless set like old sony platinums switch mimicked 3d audio needs else ‚Äô get 3d audio console 
yeah adapter getting pretty toasty back  since moving  lot better temp control  extension great idea

hot tight wearing pulse 3d  psvr2 
bought pulse psvr2 never used  probably never adds extra weight  headset feels cheap  uncomfortable prefer steelseries arctis every way 
even suitable comparison  two bluetooth use bluetooth dongle work  uses 24ghz wireless  two definitely fully functioning 24ghz asking many ‚Äô claim wireless means bluetooth   ‚Äô comparing like like  ‚Äô going use earbuds  use ones come headset  perfectly fine paying potentially latent audio signal minimal improvement audio seems bit weird compromise everyone obsessed wireless solution
ve got astro a50s hate using
like pulse 3d  generally actually prefer ear headphones  eposgtw270  sound generally equally good  pulse 3d bit better spatial feel epos gtw hybrid sounds better music  main reason use eposgtw270  longer sessions pulse hurts ear 
hesitating buying 3d pulse  use everyday headset  like  good music  watching movies laptop  etc   bluetooth wired option  prefer wired things general hate charge 85034 per day
p10 s work psvr 2 considering usb c taken  read entire post still idea one thought best anything sort 
get warm people hot climates ac  good sound fit fits around ear 
could  usually air conditioning summer  ‚Äô getting cooler months australia  ‚Äô one reasons ‚Äô trying find indexreverb g2 style solutions great 3d positional audio  think vr ears might arrive days  ‚Äô worried added weight whether might upset already precarious balance get sweet spot 
point standard 3 speed fan headset help 
gaming headsets razer master dynamic  pulse 3d sort fit psvr2 using first 
sennheiser arctis  sennheiser steelseries join forces 
24ghz low latency gaming earbuds   including pulse 3d  bluetooth mode  also specific dongle designed provide low latency audio wireless signal switch rely bluetooth  yeah bundled earbuds serviceable  ‚Äô last word audio quality  step compared pulse 3d benchmark point 
connect bluetooth headphones tv  nt need dongle  way nt experience latency anything 
yeah love a50s flat gaming  long time ‚Äô absolutely last thing would use vr2  ‚Äô fit well  neither fan pulse headsetsheadphones  wish high quality audio solutions meant vr specifically 
use gaming dongle also connect via bluetooth phone music  ‚Äô decent  comes analog cable also use psvr1
got spare usb c dongle use one ports  g fits sound best  pulse 3d p10 comparable 
use fan 
nah  meant steelseries arctis  prior used sennheiser headphones long time mixed lol
need sort adapter make work ps5 vr2  seen would use usbc port vr2 already takes usbc port course  seemed like also came ‚Äù standard ‚Äù usba dongle well  also  use usba  tested using extra usb hub ps5 
pretty sure ‚Äô getting 3d audio psvr psvr2 ‚Äô compromise vr experience  test though using wired buds bluetooth swap two move head around vr environment  ‚Äô getting proper 3d vr audio  sound always come direction ‚Äô expect sound come  example  ‚Äô got water fall front turn 90 degrees right  clockwise  expect hear waterfall left ear  predominately    wireless buds connected tv  turn head sound still coming front  ‚Äô borking vr experience need find proper solution 
ok  possibility used wired good point  may m looking s okeish music tho  d really like something use daily everything  gaming included   
vr p10  got 4 port usb hub plugged front  use steering wheel also usb c adaptor got amazon

pistol whip audio change
""
lord ‚Äô work  email sent 
 deleted 
change  personally much prefer old way  ca nt tell s something get used s also problem cause seems laggy haptic feedback also seems muffled compared give feedback https  cloudheadgamescomcontact
god hope bring back old haptic feedback reloading  interest playing last night changed haptics  sure means much though lol
ooh patch issue vr settings  dislike change much  felt like audio bug since sound delayed nt sound  snappy  
much development change games till longer game bought  saying change drastic  wish could stay versions im satisfied 
replied email saying changes intentional  sent long heartfelt email back explaining nailed formula first time around   gun sounds would practically next ears  made everything sound impactful almost like instrument soundtrack  also play single gun 80  time  hearing gun right ear ‚Äô feel good  asked least give us option use ‚Äú legacy ‚Äù audio mix  find game hard enjoy  favourite psvr2 launch title far 
 nobody ask 
‚Äô notice much difference sound volumes delays although ‚Äô played lot  however reload haptic vibration immediately noticed changed feels wrong  feels far late reload  right moment shook hand  ‚Äô late feels odd
 ai nt broke  nt fix 
wondering different  bought synth riders  played  played pistol whip thrown different felt  thought synth riders superior audio  maybe s bias electro swing music ruining  good know s feeling actual downgrade  us  suppose   gon na send email 
fix overzealous autoaim 
sounds like change better 
confirm  find change offputting detrimental 
2 days playing  tried playing tonight somewhat fresher mindset  trying hard convince ‚Äú ‚Äô bad ‚Äù ‚Äô really get sounds limp  interestingly enough  take earphones listen tv ‚Äô sound system  reload sounds nice bold  meant  ‚Äô much latency hmd tv audio viable alternative play  ended play session much earlier usually  got yet another email today saying bring concerns team  really hope fix  ‚Äô hopeful point  seem adamant direction want game go  opinion  clickclack sound racking slide gun one greatest sound effects time  likely drew game first place  pistol whip nailed sound update  ‚Äô shame bury deep background 
thinking  ‚Äù fix ‚Äù sounds good theory really downgrade experience  hope revert back least provide option menu 
hah ahhh üòÇü•≤üò≠ü§Æ
sent msg
yeah feedback left  ‚Äô really fan  gave last night 2 games
email sent delayed haptic reload
hey guys  fixed   ‚Äô new month credit card ‚Äô looking new games buy 
get used something s hard adjust especially s synchronized audio video together  m gon na give another go really felt
game theseus
lol asked legacy option  really hope offer cause yeah nt
get way cause lot devs look constantly improve product  make changes  sometimes changing  adding removing  right way  personally ‚Äô seen studios sometimes go way overboard stuff like og game becomes ‚Äú unrecognizable ‚Äù  also inferior product result   hopefully case pistol whip  add options back rather customize it revert change 
definitely email cause nt seem intentional bugs much sound
pistol whip got updated 1000003‚Ä¶ anything change 
turn
sounds like actually hear
make sure emailtweet hopefully give us option revert far nt heard one person say like
‚Äô even notice anymore like ten minutes

model headphones  trying hd560s  momentum 3  pc38x  put headset 
got new cable hd560s still 12 meters s shortest could find  hoping something like 6 inches could nt find one short
see much back forth 51 use positional audio  track head move  settings use playstation properly 
hdmi receiver tv  missing optical  may try much latency 
audio track turn accurate face exactly center tv 
throwback  pair leather headback peeling super badly

coil ends length two audio jacks  use rubber band similar tie coil  voil√† 
definitely find short cables like  8 inches seems common size  good  expect 1 inch side taken connector  give 6 inches cable  get rightangle ones make easier connect  able find amazon  ymmv ll fit headphones  headphones need super thin plug
track head rotation psvr1 yet since 51 setup calibrated voices mostly come center speaker sound bit weird facing rear speakers  nt tried psvr2  pistol whip always forward facing  ps5 setup 51 71 speaker placement  make sure matches setup  get best sound directly connect ps5 amp hdmi use pcm  uncompressed   use hdmi arc  beware hdmi 21 s limited 51 lossy dddts stereo via  lossless  pcm  hdmi 21 adds earc lossless sound tv amp   also need hdmi 21 amp  environment plays huge role benefits 51 headphones  bigger room  clutter  avoid flutter  unwanted echoes   better  wooden floors walls best  concrete bare walls worst  sound needs room breathe  bass sounds long sound waves easily create standing waves small rooms concrete walls  like waves bath tub  subwoofer position make huge difference  get system calibrated right s comparison sound field get compared headphones  problem  neighbors would rather use headphones   lot physical turning  headphones provide stable sound field  51 setups meant listened backwards   great rhythm games  thumper  gt7 etc 
track head set doesnt want reason im guessing go sound settings  av receiver  manually set speaker positions match room
250 ohm dt 990s run amp  ‚Äô awful ‚Äô like using headset ‚Äô like something new well
seems though designed compliment one another  zero issues fit around halo  provide better clarity  different sensation low end compared inears  true ear headphones  less clippingdistortion high volume  think using force use headset mic slightly lower quality feel like mute button allowing keep passthrough headset function button worth trade  real cons s slightly less convenient buds mean weight head 
oh yeah  much better earbuds s easy put tends shift games like pistol whip cause small head  re decent wireless headphones price  audiophilequality 
putting nt really small head either pleasantly surprised
bummer  
""
headset  decent amount wiggle room  head nt small  s huge either  hd 250bt onear  headband pretty flexible  may fit variety skulls  re 125g  good bit lighter pulse headset  bluetooth  compatible aptx low latency  works well avantree bt dongle  noticable lag  m pretty sensitive delay   hd 450bt  overear   also fit headset  s tight  work bluetooth wire

issue well  trying everything including factory reset home theater system  turns turning tv onfixed
issue ps5 well  kinda annoying turn tv offon ‚Äô fixed 
sound come re browsing main menu wearing headset  soon launch game sound start coming speakers well  mine works  would nt bother support hdmi chain issue  cec commands get interpreted strange way causing surround system go mute  suggested turning devices hdmi link could help resolving issue 
oh shit   sounds home screen quiet audio demos ve tried  rather use receiver headphones  linear pcm  d never notice s switching since m wearing set 
hmmmm even sound running receiver 
try turning tv receiver ‚Äô actual game test today  yesterday girlfriend playing nonvr game turned headset wiping killed sound  ‚Äô reminded ask help
s worth shot  ps5  weird hdmi ve noticed haha
pulse 3d audio issues using psvr2
use pulse 3d main headset ps5  works fine m regular games  even use pc    x200b  try use wearing psvr2  audio plays  cuts seconds comes back  turn vr  starts working fine    x200b  normally  would say whatever use earbuds vr  find uncomfortable    x200b  anyone help 
issue  re alone  m sorry say nt explanation fix  hope someone else 
usb dongle pulse3d attached front rear usb port 
mine issue past 2 weeks  thought fixed ferrite core around 1m usbc extension cord  problem back last night  edit  noticed first time played twd   think ps5 update released time 
make sure ‚Äô wireless devices  cellphone airpods stuff keep pockets away  let know  swear fixed 
plugged pulse headset didnt issues ve used  disconnect earbuds headset plug headphones like instead  perfect solution want wear wireless  s option 
also experienced issue recently  noticing week two ago playing facing away ps5 tv  interestingly  played gt7 seated facing ps5 directly  nt come across problem  nt tried since 
thing  never happened playing couchtv  would get intermittent drops wearing vr headset  seemed causing vr standing play space close interference source  specifically router  moved issue stopped  also try factory resetting headphones  https  youtubeb1jgxaqfjhg   https  youtubeb1jgxaqfjhg 
usb slot‚Ä¶  always use back usb port dongle  problems pulse steelseries headset 
beep seconds  disconnect come back   turn mute  need mic hear beep mute un mute  stops disconnect happening  ‚Äô know could never find permanent fix anywhere 
moved router couple feet away ps5 seems fixed  interference seems likely psvr signal possibly due data sent
tried hard wiring via 35mm headphone jack direct headset 
found using usbc extension cable front ps5 caused audio cut outs  put dongle rear fine 
issue today pavlov  nt used psvr2 3 days  never issue  recent ps5 update  game updates ps5 update recent list  usually clear list check  assume recent update caused issue pulse 3d headphones wireless mode  obviously plug via 35mm really like wireless  hopefully sony realise s issue release update fix broke  nt changed thing setup working great weeks  s jarring playing noticeable static sound half sec pretty loud  cuts audio 2 seconds
tried use setup nt get issues used front usb headphones dongle
front  plug back    x200b  edit  tried plugging back  issue still stands  headset disconnected minute 
maybe turn wifi bluetooth devices room well 
noticed  use 02m extension vr2  get audio cuts dongle front  putting rear fixes  thats annoying since would use two rear ports power charging stations 
front port way  hot air coming back firstgen ps5 would overheat dongle  range headphones seems much shorter bluetooth  make sure ps5 nt behind tv like mine 
sounds like s much signal interference current setup  wifi dongles pretty poor reception 
hmmm https  youtubeee8zeygbnbi video recommends using one front  case use front usb port use usb hub extend number ports also brings dongle closer headset
get usb extension cable place dongle away heat  wifi sources  nt issues mine way  even go rooms stay connected  plugged directly console cuts lot short distance 
well  dont think hinders anything 
used dongles behind monitor cut audio
would need amp use dayton audio bass shaker
use wire  spliced  psvr2 ‚Äô 35 jack
way psvr2 ‚Äô 35 jack output 50 watts  yes need amp  kind dunno  hopefully someone knowledgeable comment
yes  need amp  also need sim hub pc want tether speaker gt7 haptic outputs 
figured wasnt sure  im really knowledgeable department  thanks reply
kopy  guess im fine without 
song smoke rekindled  really  nice visuals sound  bow arrow feels really good really cool atmosphere 
found little hard keep track needed moment moment  got survive s really fun  critter scared getting ready chill camp 
song smoke pretty amazing  m yet pick psvr2 quest  really want  never completed quest found headset uncomfortable

best audio solution found psvr2
""
3d pulse  prefer ear fit great psvr2 
much audio lag bluetooth  ‚Äô better sticking headphones plugged vr unit wireless gaming headset  use low latency codecs  
solution  nt know problem 
bluetooth dude  hell 
sony ‚Äô pulse headset would cheaper good thinj
delay sound 
adapter fine  need find headphones support aptx codec 
use soundcore vr p10  works great steam deck  pc ps5 none lag 
get headphone supports aptxll  ought trick 
somehow get psvr2 included earphones fit ear  3 different sized rubber nt seem fit properly  solutions 
sony already solved  pulse 3d headset flawless  cheaper 
need adapter  tv connect airpods directly 
pulse headset best
bluetooth causes lot audio lag though  nt matter music  s always bothered games 
3d audio disabled plugging directly headset 35mm jack
arctis nova pro wireless 
avantree dongle  exactly one still  noticeable audio delay bluetooth  shooters especially shoot gun sound lags behind  really started bother bought soundcore vr p10 come 24 ghz dongle plug ps5 eliminating audio latency   soundcore vr p10   https  iimgurcomrusocj1jpg 
really like nuratrue pro  dongle
latency 
understand  ve gone tons audio solutions trying find preference  m using similar setup aptx iem s wireless adapters  m also using steelseries pro gamedac chain clean signal  know gets degraded somewhat aptx  sounds great  wired great  close ears  better wired psvr2 s dac though imo   eqing preference  m definitely audiophile ve become picky sound years  also pulse 3d etc often reach due comfort sound preference  pulse 3ds great right well  also realize way top people want throw something play lol  apparently issues haha 
almost play without pulse 3d headset find fit perfectly psvr2 headset nt move pulse 3d    x200b  put headset barely  put pulse 3d onto ears  adjust headset place s perfect 
got pulse 3d perfect addition  theres isnt better option  ill pay  100 able mute idgaf
re happy latency  great  sennheiser momentum tws 3 creative btw4 dongle  ie  aptx adaptive  s ok games like gt7 perhaps god war  anything shooting gun annoying hear 80ms lag right away  today read new logitech g fits  look promising  bluetooth phone usage lightspeed dongle gaming  plus crazy cool molding technology makes fit ear perfectly  shame got sennheisers months ago

surround sound playback work via av receiver  although sound tv  2 channel sound  2 channels also played back av receiver  psvr 1 problem  pc  psvr2 nt want support wants push emulated 3d audio  best  set menu leave sound output unchanged  psvr2 change setting 
use wired hyper x cloud iis  find headband holds headset place  rather long slippery hair 
awesome  stand warm ears 
noticeable 
agreed  mainly deal less cables increase comfort  warm ears   unnoticeable trade offs imo
warm ears 
hello  looks like ve made mistake  s supposed could ve  ve  would ve  short could  would    never could  would   misspelled something  ai nt checking everything  beep boop  yes  bot  nt botcriminate 
sony headsets usually cheap plastic overpriced earphones  ve two gold versions shaped right middle  go strap audio like quest 2 imo 
huge  nearly 150ms 
low delay imo  slightly noticeable  lipaudio sync  pay extreme attention  comfortable makes overall vr experience better  easier take offput headset  less cables  warm ears  etc 
use headphones 24 ghz dongle nt use bluetooth instead 24 ghz audio transmission also works great
yep  s thing  people completely dismissive bluetooth audio  depends codec support dongle   headphones 
get foam tips instead provided rubber tips   people ‚Äô get along ears anyway 
‚Äô imagine playing synth riders pulse headset  get sweaty enough without headphones  adding pulse would torture 
yes  nt find bad compared benefits particular needs 
wrong  3d audio works fine using dongle  know m also using dongle headphones 
case psvr 1
still hear directional sound  big deal imo 
bullshit
great solution stand rubber tips
low imo justified trade comfort standards  cables  warm ears  decent sound  3d audio works   etc 
correct   tested ton solutions  added post subject  best solution  particular needs  cables  hot ears  silicone tips  etc 
yeah ideally d use open back 599 s strap nt allow
pretty noticeable yeah like rhythm games nt even think  becomes almost unplayable

know top quality wired ear headphones right 
dont play vr highly physical manner bro  ‚Äô understand üò≠üò≠

notice  ‚Äô already way high 
notice lipsync delay must actually huge 
definitely play pistol whip synth riders pulse  played pistol whip 2 hours morning ceiling fan going  way could play headphones came psvr2 would constantly fall moving 
works s great 
yeah another reply  could nt psvr1 assumed psvr2  looked  well goid thing go wireless happy days
ah ok s thinking nt work  good know play wireless lol
bit full response  calm nt get knickers twist  bit angry today
well memory foam tips buy
pulse headsets avoid re sony proprietary  lag small enough nonaudiophile like nt notice  e  bluetooth answer  thanks 
ears get hot wearing headphones
hot ears 
yes need deal wire  
nt think airpods sorry aptx
nt bother 
s
like look  like mura making analogy 
wow  ‚Äô even play 15 minutes take headset wipe towel  synth riders gran turismo  actually play home theatre speakers  since ‚Äô always facing speakers games  ot works pretty well  earbuds came falling ears  also painful wear  feel like cheap silicone tips  probably  
interpreting lot single word  nt 
nt use bluetooth 
 sorry ‚Äô hear  ears hot
deal wire  literally plugged directly headset  would wire issue 
know ear headphones come unit quality well  use 
nah probably airpods total shite  benefit supposed convenience never arrives since 80  time try use mine meeting left one connects first time put back case take exactly second time magically works  ah course
well  s difference  nt bother   low delay  though 
s quite opinion  mura less noticeable enjoy experience nt pay attention  audio delay  mean  unless purposefully avoid looking character s talking  nt really see pay attention 
oh  nt get wrong m definitely sweaty mess end feel like great workout  use vr facemask thing protect headset though  also like house set 64 degrees play room massive window always colder rest house m naturally warm time 
yes  would put smiley face next might different interpretation one word
would nt call quality  re  20 earbuds ear 
take  high  absolute value  nt case   beauty  eye beholder  s high nt bother 
m adult

need help extension cables audio  puppy proof setup 
m hoping psvr2 comes back repair soon puppy gsd bitten headset cable  make sure playing vr future safe everyone including wallet  d want make changes  hoping infohelp  got questions  1  play vr airpods pro 2 bluetooth adapter  1b   got  amazon nleu  recommendation adapters  2  use usbcthunderbold extension cable psvr2 hook cable ceiling s floor  3  s current actual risk putting ps5 vertical mode  cable extension nt option  putting ps5 open cabinet would option  wall mount behind tv  enough room get vr cable ceiling

airpods work ps5  curiosity  ‚Äô use builtin headphone jack  want better audio buy quality set wired earbuds plug  bluetooth audio quality inherently inferior wired earbuds
get pulse 3d headphones  go great psvr2 wireless 
feel pain  tabby got pissed playing didnt let outside night chewed cord  luckily s still playable  electrical tape  sure put outside anytime m playing  m also thinking ceiling pulley system  best luck 
let surround sound handle audio  works fine far 
length restrictions 
biggest issue headphone s airpods pro airpods pro max passthrough totally shit  airpods pro 2 airpods max insane passthrough always let know miley s walking around  proper earbuds 50 euro would d jump  know airpods working ps5  get bluetooth adapter 
passthrough  transparency mode

turn sidetalk hear heard headset microphone headphones 
proper wired earbuds pass fine  good pair sound infinitely better bluetooth set  
pair steelseries arctis 7p 1  connect via audio jack  2  confirm significantly better passthrough airpods pro 2 passthrough volume turned way arctis 7p hear hair brushing earpieces  gently rub fingers together arms length clearly hear sound make  ‚Äô airpods max idea compares 
using headphones transparency mode time  ‚Äô better open ear headphones  definition  sound quality going take significant hit anc transparency mode  koss 40mm driver headphones cheap would give better experience 
s great  connects directly ps5  psvr2  benefits  none cons
block barely noise  transparency mode necessary 
confirm 2m works  ‚Äô confirm whether longer cable still work 
‚Äô t‚Ä¶ name one good wired earbud proper passthrough  unless open‚Ä¶ wired airbuds headset let sounds
airpods pro 2  reason want airpods ‚Äô want war headset playing movement heavy games  ‚Äô  want sweat much  headset market openback better transparency mode apples app2 apm  nothing even comes close
overear nt want sweating 
microphone‚Ä¶  ‚Äô transparant mode
block lot noise compared transparency mode  s important know dog s move  something perfectly m playing game apm  tell without looking s chewing something  nt want use apm playing movement heavy games 
2m works reliable without hiccups  bought recommended one amazon connection issues one time time 
 psvr2 passes audio builtin mic‚Ä¶every set headphones gets pass result  adjust pass volume level well  psvr1

bad decision  used mute volume buttons psvr often 
yeah remember seeing  strange decision  hopefully ‚Äô easy adjust software 
‚Äô using pulse use volume controls
 deleted 
‚Äô use volume dial headphones
millisecond outraged  dare   realized use valve index 95  time volume either  nbd
pulse 3d ‚Äô volume rocker latching mute button come handy  
way  m cancelling preorder  ll wait next gen s
ve literally never used ones psvrv2 great loss really 
s shame volume controls convenient 
thankfully headphones mute button  everyone else  s annoying 
annoying
plug earphones like original 
nt care 
pulse 3d ftw
mute s pretty useful stream andor play multiplayer  comes across big omission gamers affect  able quickly mute really convenient need coughsneezeswear win opponent got 
big deal
fine long still plug mantis headphones ‚Äô good  never liked headphones vr came
s pretty stupid omission 
used headset volume dial  ‚Äô fine  ‚Äô expect headset one 
like ps4 headset blocks mute button dualshockdualsense  odd decision 
m using thread ask another dumb question  vr headset come buildin mic like dualsense controller  use headphone pair nt mic psvr2 multiplayer games would want speak players 
seems odd face designed thing 3d pulse headphones mind  stuff 
oooof ouch
pulse3d headphones fit 
dumb idea 
pretty sure toggles handled pulse 3d ui 
good recommendations earbuds volume control 
welp  hope yall like hearing vape  nt ps5 controller mute button right  new sticks  seems like dumb oversight 
trash goes  wtf thinking   
pulse headphone volume controls anyway  always fumble volume controls headset
s mute button dual sense  maybe s button hand controllers  also terms headphones use pulse inbuilt controls anyway
‚Äô cool turning sound eyes
non issue really 
good  less mess 
oh loved volume buttons accidentally pushed whenever leaned back chair version one psvr 
wish would look audio control speak harry potter game saying spell waving controller correctly cast spell press right button right action
mean headphones nowadays dial mute button
s  preorder cancelled  getting quest instead s
‚Äô truth vr headsets ‚Äô work standalone like quest pico 
psvr2 looks cool ‚Äô playstation guy many years ‚Äô sorta glad ‚Äô getting quest 2 instead  psvr2 ‚Äô look bad ‚Äô even tried  quest games want games psvr aswell  hype dies might try one switch back day  sound buttons mute sorta loss 
‚Äô rather volume control mute button passthrough video  first serious misfire hmd  think earphone mute buttons might still work  ridiculous oversight  although‚Ä¶ perhaps mute function embedded sense controllers  like dualsense 
two reasons nt really matters   headphones volume control buttons  vr nt really need adjust volume  needs pretty high immersion  nt want ear people around
even though abit make break people  s nice keep simple use pulse headphones volume rocker
never bothered using sound buttons original psvr  preset playstation audio party chat always works anyway
use independent headset anyway old turtle beach steel series volume mute headset plus mute controller also mates headset mic
 mute would nice hey ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è enough buttons  controls general  already  like every corner hmd  üòÅ
huh  well ‚Äô disheartening  gon na annoyance build overtime sure  obviously ‚Äô oversight  ‚Äô weird  usually use  600 headphones gaming  volume control whatsoever  gon na cancel preorder  could see title tables someone 
lol people canceling pre orders 
mute pretty pointless anyway volume control would ‚Äô nice  said basically never used anyway 
like tactile volume controls devices  hopefully eye tracking quick menus means really fast way changing volume 
madness  weird design choice given dual sense controllers dedicated button mute micmute audio  new headset many buttons already passthru modepd  still counting days like santa ‚Äô coming town 
incorrect  least mute function  https  blogplaystationcom20230206playstationvr2theultimatefaq  headset features builtin microphone  power button  function button switch see view muteunmute microphone  
huge huge oversight  m always fidgeting volume buttons get perfect volume depending game circumstances  also find lack mute button problem headsets  require like 20 clicks  wtf 
favorite ease use feature ps5 far  sometimes need talk somebody ‚Äô want hear ad mute press button
think s billion people like physical volume buttons side mobiles use every day  pretty bad decision  maybe gesture volume 
disagree  would often mute forget unmute  hud see ‚Äô muted easier personally also means physical wear buttons buttons
 bad choice sony  pc support already put makes even  going wait quest 3 later year
‚Äô sure second version ‚Äô eventually make psvr2 volume buttons  ‚Äô dummies
 deleted 
really wish pulse let us use controller mic mute button  ‚Äô always fumbling buttons pulse 
advantage getting pulse headset ps4 gold headset already  m googling s hard tell d want make purchase  use golds fine psvr1  m planning using psvr2 
s wired
oh right  ‚Äô gon na use pulse   maybe‚Ä¶ want buy volume buttons separately  go headphones 
s audio coming psvr2 headset  would audio buttons tv 
work  wired earbuds 
yea nt see massive turnoff unless ui get volume controls burried ton shit 
‚Äô tried vr headset  would one able wear pulse 3ds simultaneously 
  builtin headset controls supported ps vr mobile devices   sony s website   https  wwwplaystationcomenusaccessoriespulse3dwirelessheadset     simply plug headset playstation¬Ævr well mobile devices included 35mm jack audio cable3  sounds like psvr gives stereo audio output headset  acts regular  dumb  headset  3d audio re supposed get 
cancel preorder financing issues  resolved tried preorder sony shut saying one per household  fucking scalpers bullshit ruined everyone
‚Äô one ‚Äô next  advancements visual display  3d sound even audio game control headset buttons simple operating already exist 
lol
re kidding right
yeah thought great first went 3 years without ever using
still  better need need 
yes  probably even s reasonable chance usb headphones work trailed console  unlike psvr  3d audio tech console headset days 
yeah going super frustrating  planning use ear headphones since ‚Äô significantly comfortable wearing full headphones vr headset  ‚Äô mic mute button  used mic mute button constantly psvr1 
90  headsets volume mute buttons  thing could affect s microphone psvr2 controllers needs muted 
spreading new case anybody missed
m really surprised anyone would want use headphones comes 
huh  mean microphone mute button 
psvr certainly  used one two games blowing fan something similar   really sure psvr2 though  seems likely ‚Äô certainly taking us much room psvr one bottom headset 
yeah  used every multiplayer game  microphone underside headset  would always leave muted unless playing multiplayer game lobby players mic  mute button going super annoying multiplayer games  going psvr2 hot mics 24x7 
sarcasm 
‚Äô ‚Äô button controllers ‚òπÔ∏è feels like missed opportunity  easy add  controllers x square triangle  l1 r1  options button share button ps button 
mute pretty essential though especially mic close mouth 
600 dollar headphones without volume control  ü§∑üèª
600 dollar headphones going nice receiver bud really need volume control  psvr2 going amp headphones worth shit  use etymotics straight set though 
mute nt pointless multiplayer games nt want heard
vaping disagrees 
press hold microphone mute controller mute sound
lol ads virtual reality  talk captive audience  raboringdystopia 
omg man s shy nt mute button  forced watch listen ads life quit whatever m lol
perhaps mute function embedded sense controllers  like dualsense 
disagree various reasons share today thank
buttons almost certainly breakpoint unit  push multiple buttons use ui interface  ‚Äô way easier less wear tear  checkpoint  nerd 
 also means physical wear buttons buttons   taps forehead 
""
basically kind interested getting although wo nt support pc volume buttons much bare 
definitely ‚Äô already something would saved money add first modify design fit second  want upgrade greater tracking  resolution  sound  etc pointless features maybe surveys found majority people ‚Äô use left keep price 
would strange thing make survey 
hold mic mute button controller mute ps5 audio 
advantage  s thing 
upgraded gold pulse due gold ‚Äô getting little worse wear years  find pulse work well psvr due design  slip headset easily  people ‚Äô think comfortable find less equivalent gold  real complaint still require dongle  forces swap psvr usb cable want use vr 
think golds better  personally 
actually uses wired 
coming headset ‚Äô using wired headphones wired earbuds come  people probably using wired straight headset
please ‚Äô tell use vr tv audio
love downvotes poverty people afford  1200 worth gaming equipment ca nt afford a headset sale  70 christmas  seriously  using buds come system still  would love hear someone s legitimate reasoning  lol 
headset volume dial  work  however  ‚Äô using inear headphones came headset  set volume ‚Äô really reason change  rarely adjust  menu quick pull 
right  absolutely available quick ui quick button press hold 
pulse seems designed fit headset  yes 
sony s set ces  s designed way 
fit even psvr1  imo ‚Äô little uncomfortable much head covered  sweaty   ‚Äô reason valve index ‚Äô ear setup considered best vr audio  ‚Äô way muteunmute psvr2 ‚Äô using included earbuds ear setup like rebuff reality vr ears 
talking psvr1 psvr2  either way  psvr1 breakout box processing 3d audio plugged jack headset  psvr2 3d audio processed ps5  gone settings ps5 check yet 
headset give 3d audio
dang   would ‚Äô kept order last minute ‚Äô charge headsets ship get familyfriend ‚Äô care vr put order  ‚Äô see somy putting vr2 retailers late march early april
thing happened  guess wait release order  unless keep policy place foreseeable future 
afaik  able order without even talking support 
easy say re one manufacturing
ever figure re7 issue  deleted everything
yeah hate someone multiplayer game normal domestic conversation coughing re like  bro fuck listening private conversations    hate even guilty party often 
use like
garbage  work need say watch quick porn lmao 
ah yes clearer 
physical volume buttons headset dealbreaker  onscreen ui way slow kind constant adjustments 
used mute loads original psvr   finger crossed pulse mute works 
audiophile headphones nt volume control  even 200  beyerdynamic dt770 pro nt volume control  interface control headset volume pc  edit  currently use steelseries arctis 7 ps5  hopefully  fit psvr2
yeah  gem said  generally  headphones volume control amp set probably sucks  find volume control pair headphones  ‚Äô going lower quality majority time  ‚Äô take look best headphones  ‚Äô music  go find pair ‚Äô volume control  mention another price point  another part  cable longer replaceable cables cost  20 upwards  50  could buy good headphones  buy good amp volume control  ‚Äô bulky vr  even expensive  obviously considering vr reddit  better headphones  better sound experience  think agree sound important visuals comes vr 
nah  ‚Äô go straight set  ‚Äô need volume control  also ‚Äô need lot things  ‚Äô qol feature ‚Äô convenient  prevalent every time need something  course ‚Äô never seen ui could super intuitive especially eye tracking  ‚Äô trading optimism qol improvement  simple qol improvement   obviously chose reason  save space  ‚Äô thing think 
‚Äô talking microphone mute  audio 
mute microphone  sure 
nt vape  ll kill 
yup s m referring  nice feature 
thanks clarifying  actually nt know 
maybe sense controllers similar feature   ‚Äô use dualsense since play vr exclusively 
disagree previous two 
yeah  able mute control volume basic necessity  people still buy  mark words  people start using one complaint effing annoying bring side panel something  interrupting maybe pausing thus killing game  try adjust volume control  ‚Äô gaming headset apparently making harder game 
aha‚Ä¶ know went psvr1 v1 vs v2 
history shows us ‚Äô likely wrong minor hardware version update improving tracking  resolution sound  psvr 1 versions 1 2 identical terms things  thy really upgraded making cable slimmer  updating pass box support hdr made included earbuds hang headset  adding physical volume control buttons kinda minor design tweaks may make couple years major changes ‚Äô  ‚Äô definitely far likely feature add though improving quality resolution displays tho  imo 
 deleted 
mutes sound mic  ‚Äô nice able mute mic button  pulse disables
s thought might confirmed  need buy new ones guess  thanks 
thanks extra insight  ll keep using golds maybe check pulse golds stop usable 
chuck headphones dongle usb port back  free one  s mine stays 
errre‚Ä¶  forget charge lol‚Ä¶ lot‚Ä¶ ‚Äô actually since ‚Äô plugged üòÇüòÇ
well nt care battery edit  downvoted  said literally nothing wrong  pointed ca nt control volume pulse headphones wired mentioned benefit using wired 
playing psvr  ca nt use wireless  s safe assumption psvr¬≤  edit  stand corrected 
yeah  read specs sheet psvr2  see least microphone   hopefully thought kind shortcut mute since s button controllers either 
please nt tell usethe earbuds come lol  lgcx definitely better sound   couple pulse 3ds love headsets anyway 
use audiophilequality headphones  ‚Äô volume controls ‚Äô  pretty useful first ps vr volume controls  ‚Äô unwilling spend money ‚Äô sure went straight  sort focus money whether people healthy  bro 
would go settings  s yet 
still managed snag preorder  use buddy s psn account  brothers mailing address  different payment card  account  mailing address  payment method declined canceling already ordered 
idk able order  previously could cancelled nonhorizon one  preordered  would keep trying want 
yeah s really big loss  m less bullshit make best headset  probably due space 
yea  dumb  thought enabled vr mode  guess nt activated  checked fixed 
lmao please hide away  real stop fucking people 
really man  understand s stupid omission  like others said  valve index also volume control  needs done steam  honestly never even thought  wo nt play next gen vr one thing  nt need adjusting volume constantly  although agree would nice case 
m guessing wo nt like next iphone either 
never used volume buttons psvr  actually even forgot  psvr2 even remotely problem  ll using pulse 3d headset controls need 
‚Äô missing controller mute button ‚Äô annoying  toggle mute time playing multiplayer people ‚Äô listen house background noises  really like dual  ‚Äô get wrong ‚Äô still uber hyped ‚Äô wait  ‚Äô minor annoyance 
s clear mute button missing headset microphone mute button 
quite contrary ‚Äî helped quit smoking  would ‚Äô killed 
entitled wrong opinion
put man cell 1  give drink 
psvr1 v1 get serious audio upgrade annoying headphone socket identical design new v2 also  ‚Äô know maybe use verbal command  hey playstation  get mic normally preset mic volume anyway settings 
add bring upgraded version  first psvr indeed poor cables lacked hdr  enough customers  millions  complain buttons first otherwise improvements devoted graphics  audio sound  tracking game controls 
sony ‚Äô keeping track 
weird considering ‚Äô sony products  definitely ‚Äô work like  hope update soon 
weird since mute using button headset controller button lights orange show s muted  ca nt mute button  issue golds 
get pulse mic button easily accessible  unmute accident time
first thought external hdd attached camera breakout box  ‚Äô usb ports  tried using usb hub  seems like draws much power  usb drive couple errors ‚Äô seem keep usb hub disconnected  think psvr 2 make moot ‚Äô really looking forward 
 deleted 
clearly use wireless  literally see ces 
nope  incorrect  psvr 1 ‚Äô work wireless audio 3d spatial audio processing handled psvr breakout box  ps4  wireless headphones would ‚Äô bypassed  providing user normal stereo sound  case ps5  psvr 2 bc time around  console handle 3d audio processing via dedicated tempest engine hardware ps5
‚Äô pass mode  seems might considered enough mute ‚Äô probably muting see hear something real world pass instantly give 
actually tv  51 kef system  even ‚Äô use good headphones vr  would take earbuds come sound system take advantage directional audio 
lmao good deal
100  skip psvr2 version  like waited v2 psvr1  testing first version  bad volume button placement  vr excludes extreme way outside world mutinggood sound level ready available without need put headphones fiddling menu throwing vr experience 
next iphone still buttons  clickable ones  also iphone ‚Äô vr headset  still see surroundings 
psvr1 disabled volume control wireless headset slashing 80 bucks ‚Äô necessarily good deal 
people nt need listen eat snack take drink rounds ü§£
audio controls  psvr audio level audio mute controls  psvr2  psvr microphone mute button ever 
except people vape way nicotine therefore ‚Äô get less addicted 
vaping bad worse smoking 
pizza
nice idea  using verbal command mute mic kinda defeats point  ‚Äô 
‚Äô muted  would work 
‚Äô pulse physical button pops engaged  really nice feature able tell whether muted  could use button controller one  ‚Äô able always properly give feedback anymore 
‚Äô always fumbling button  want able quickly push end pushing two sets volume knobs find every time 
absolutely false  3d audio requires stereo headphones  s nothing special pulse 
‚Äô true  get 3d audio using wired headsets plugged dualsense  sony includes earbuds psvr2 wired headphones also support 3d audio  pulse3d work like wired headphones ‚Äô plugged powered 
cool  thanks informative correction 
nt going release new fucking version volume control  taken need space  stop muppet lol 
psvr 2 camera pass enable view surroundings real time  least s   going continue pointless conversation though  clearly trolling 
ps5 well  plug pulse 3d headset dualsense controller  agree buying pulse headset specially psvr2 might deal  designed work psvr2  issue  got pulse headset way got ps5  headband gold headset snapped got pulse replacement 
headset  3 buttons volume  volume mute mic  mute audio button speak
psvr 100  microphone mute button  literally see mic mute logo button look bottom headset  use mic mute time multiplayer vr games since mic unmuted ‚Äô players lobby mics 
last time checked name passport ‚Äô read ‚Äú people ‚Äù  also  never trust statistics ‚Äô faked 
sure bud 
pineapple  disagree either way 
mind reading
default mic setting mute  set default  never needs turning party chat 
like ‚Äô release second version psvr1 needed space   slash 600 bucks product essential design flaws playflow 
nt fee trolls 
‚Äò 100  trolling  direct volume control deal breaker  headset volume control left usable course problem  physical sound control would stupid beyond believe 
‚Äô called eyes experience 
nt make sense lmao  released another version huge issue  hdr passthrough tuned areas first gen set  killed volume switch like valve index takes space  money  nt need 
idiots dumb things time  think called idiots 
alright  trolling opinion reacting beyond belief  need purchase thing  fun 
 ‚Äô called anecdotal evidence 
god  bootlicker  ‚Äô major flaw direct physical sound control vr headset  would defend something explicitly fixed v2  amount money expect basic features previous gen  ‚Äô sony sony 
index nt  others nt either  ui literally faster  nobody licking boot  nt give fuck  beyond annoying little muppet 
mommy wont buy one  problem 
looking getting steelseries arctis 7p psvr2  s fit  sound 
seems like  1 choice  affordable  wireless headphones  concerned size earcups get pushed low vr headset  easy adjust size hot  little wife s head plays  head huge much smaller  use psvr 2  please give opinion  thanks 
arctis 7p comfortable sound great  unfortunately nt fit head psvr2  bought pulse 3d fits great 
mine hovers ears rather forming seal  nt really given go result  get round 
shit maybe head massive barely get fit  ‚Äô tight seems work lot people 
great headphones used alone  great psvr2  big head find comfortable  worse limit adjustability psvr2  also pulse3ds much better psvr tight head  end bought shure iems  comfortable  cooler sound great 
‚Äô fit right psvr2 me‚Ä¶ returning  hoping pulse 3d fits better
s comfortable gaming headset ve ever worn  light tight  sound quality wise s good  s muddy sound quality low resolution  price bracket sennheiser pc 38x ve bought  s wired cable nt hassle wear headset  clamp hard first wan na stretch box comes day two re wearing  s open back sounds spacious  good resolution details  everything sounds really clear  sounds dispersed throughout headset feels like s coming around  sound quality wise gaming headset thing really beats audeze s offerings twice price much heavier  new maxwell nt work psvr 2  weight pushed front even harder gave pain  clamp also bit much caused pain 
sound really nice  tight fit psvr2 fit  also width psvr2 helps clamp tight ears real complaint headphones 
comfortable fit good l  mic little good people get feedback ll adjust bit chatting  fit pretty tight psvr2 fit still comfortable  id also recommend buying mic boom using chat 
adjust velcro strap top fits great
arctis 1 x wireless  works also fully ps5  speakers 7p  bit cheaper without headband etc  tight psvr2 halo  feels uncomfortable  got pulse fits great enough space good enough audioquality
arctis 7s well  got 2 pairs 1 extra amazon accident  sound quality really good  con material s build like ceramic plastic  s cheap  headsets cracked ear muff pivot point time 
 thanks input 
sound quality excellent  box  need plug computer run software steelseries allows adjust eq  box sound incredibly flat  idea ‚Äô ship preset eq 
nt agree  even eq re quality drivers  really muddy timbre  perceived soundstage  everything felt flat 2d  ve listened many audiophile headphones obviously much better even entry level audiophile set pc38x sounds much better  gaming  headphones made audeze  audeze s line phenomenal nt work comfort wise
‚Äô trying whenever try plug pc  pc detects use ‚Äô show steelseries program ‚Äô update 
think similar issue mac got couple years ago  remember correctly using wrong usb port headset  email steelseries support figure  oh wait  actually remembered  need use usbc dongle micro cable 
weird issue audio video adjusting headset
‚Äô weird one  morning adjusting psvr2 headset playing  making snug  ‚Äú violent ‚Äù motion anything sort  audio started crackling screen turned suddenly black couple second  readjusting made video come back  pause screen   audio  going stand made audio come back  issue repeated times  always losing audio  always video couple seconds  anyone experienced anything weird like  ‚Äô think reason would ‚Äú normal ‚Äù behavior 
could internal sensor dirty  maybe try clean microfiber cloth  would also try reproduce issue without wearing headset placing finger internal sensor 
m sure ll get couple things check sub issue almost sounds like dodgy connection cable connects port headset  look psvr2 top ll see sqaured edge plug  d turn unit offunplug  see presents loose press back towards visor make sure s fully seated  s hard think something besides cable making good connection causing everything drop  like comment called  something causing internal detection senser work properly  best luck 
thank  tried unpluggingplugging everything back  cleaning sensor contacts  pushed cable bit  ‚Äô seem unseated   everything seems work normally today   whatever  looks like ‚Äô gone

boring wish items things search take pictures would go virtual scrapbook
impulse bought  25   29 forget  saw  1 top selling chart vr game sales week ago  instant regret  overcome excitement trying anything new shiny new psvr2  total playtime probably like 15 minutes probably uninstall never play 
visually looks great  gameplay wise  needs lots content  hope money tye devs making  add lot 
‚Äô mom ‚Äô 
vr games played since getting psvr2  one gives massive motion sickness ü§¢
72 year old woman tried house  could nt stop saying oh god    telling people days afterwards 
need add fishing component 
‚Äô played 15 minutes ‚Äô ‚Äô busy titles  rents  ‚Äô great  ‚Äú lazy river ‚Äù mode apparently float around areas  although ‚Äô seen looked  ‚Äô beautiful relaxing
bought one  already owning re8  gt7  bought bundle horizon  also bought day 1 star wars totge   pleasant experience totally different games  super relaxed  letting firsttime experience vr give try  going buy one game  reconsider one 
72 year mother tried kayak vr  standing chair behind getting  came bit ducked tree branch  hit head branch real life fell right backwards  luckily fell onto chair  said felt real hit head  must haptic feedback  get mother play  would recommend sits play 
perfect vr experience standpoint  races prefer paddle around take scenery  use way someone else would use calm stress relief app  thought money well spent  especially since ‚Äô nothing else like new headset moment 
tbh regret getting kyak  thought d good  chilled graphical showcase  reality feels like tech demo empty  nt get wow moments paddling find view particularly engaging  looking items shelf village way interesting  example  best part actually game  starts re swimming pool  looks pretty neat 
gameplay leaves lot desired‚Ä¶
wanting game show psvr2 friendsfamily would highly recommend kayak vr  mother  even though played beat saber past nt want throw game required things  kayak vr obvious choice show graphics  give experience would nt get real life  reaction went vr settings setup eyes ect amazing  70 years old loves video games  shes finished tomb raiders  god wars  buy consoles games birthdaychristmas lol  blown away kayak vr  firstly put  tour  mode allows user sit experience scenery  quickly wanted control movement blast  highly recommend 
depends want  s tech demo quickly show vr people rather actual game  really ca nt imagine spending 30 minutes total 
crazy every comment sounds like pc players said far psvr2 even released  one listened game seriously overhyped beautiful unique also empty game
honestly ‚Äô great want unwind long day  take break shooting stuff  paddle  turn music calm nature  ‚Äô immersive
played max 45 minutes total  looks amazing buy money  like game  reconsider  want vr title 
bought game purely mum try vr  spent ages staring aurora trying touch pieces ice floating past  changed scenery got see whales right next  visually amazing havent played since  mum said shes excited another kayak next time visits though money well spent 
good game throw anyone new vr  ‚Äô require skill tiny amount coordination  wish levels bigger wildlife ‚Äô listen anyone says played less 15mins  lessons alone take 5 min actually takes bit get levels ‚Äô amazing price  great chill game show someone vr 
feel devs got lucky game  threw mega scan assets kayak controls s  m game dev embarrassed see lot mega scans assets even properly grounded  floating  pretty amateur  water literally one plane verticality rapids  hope somebody takes idea makes fun  premise potential 
s great visually  controls point  issue s light content might cause motion sickness  sitting kayak looking around impressive 
gets old 5 minutes id rather go outside stare sky play game
seems early access right  ‚Äô posted road map looks cool hopefully continue release new features  ‚Äô strange game ‚Äô much relaxing experience game experience  time ‚Äô pretty tiring paddle around long periods time  personally  disappointed based trailer  thought would multiplayer ended ghost races although multiplayer roadmap 
‚Äô interesting  mainly use relaxing session  really game per say  ‚Äô quite pretty look repetitive motion paddling kind relaxes mind 
dig  ‚Äô fun chill one locations listen spotify  ‚Äô like relax app instead game
boring  played release date 20 mins  never touched 
looks nice  feels cool 10 minutes  realise s lack actual things  feels empty  without purpose  imo needs content  expansion feel like game  quick experience  river rapids would spent lot time  got basics right  looks great  feels like kayaking  keep developing game  could great future
thought getting kayak vr mom could play like  ‚Äò ‚Äô better  ‚Äô better them ‚Äô took mom real kayak ride  got 5 minutes lake smile face tear eye  kayak flipped drowned  wish gotten kayak vr
‚Äô beautiful  boring  yes  bought wife try vr   40 cad probably 20 minutes play time  maybe ‚Äô return one day try racing 
enjoyed first 10mins practicing swimming pool  5mins testing map ‚Äô touched since  ‚Äô pretty boring tbh 
honestly wish nt bought  ya looks great s boring awful lotta work get anywhere 
mean  ‚Äô fairly low priced content adequate enough price  eyes takes couple hours finish ‚Äô little bit cheaper

hahaha dudeeee   
sent saw picture saying also open world  idk like wow must massive
‚Äô tiring üòÜ  white water rapids mode sounds fun open world map hopefully prioritize multiplayer 
use surround sound system psvr2 
anyway use 51 surround sound av receiver instead stereo sound playing psvr2  noticed everytime turn psvr2  receiver display change dts stereo 
audio misinformation ps5  psvr2 surround sound  ps5 setup output 71 pcm directly avr  calibrated position speakers  set  amazing  blows headphones iems water  ‚Äô change anything  turn head  audio coming behind comes speakers behind head moves exactly  ‚Äô heard bs ‚Äô work surround sound  lie  use every day ‚Äô phenomenal 
right  want feel subwoofer shaking floor m using headphones 3d audio  edit  think ll try cranking sub  hoping turn speaker levels 
reviews say way change audio surround sound directional audio  said little disorienting people watching screen play  good person head set   ‚Äô sure setting know change somewhere  may system audio  also check vr settings 
noticed  vr2 connected  avr changes stereo  bit bummer  thought vr games come stereo surround  ‚Äô guess  village definitely surround sound playing tv  right  maybe setting somewhere  way get surround sound vr mode without headset 
nt plug anything 35mm jack headset  like earbuds comes  plays sound surround speakers 
‚Äô meant used stereo earphones 3d audio 
3d audio nt work surround  stimulates 3d positioning based two speakers  short always stereo s okay 
also want know  got boss hife sitting ti use cheapie ear phones
mine pumps audio headphones surround speakers time  get game  surround speakers stereo  sound moves barred player looking game
played 71 surround sound system last week directional audio speakers 
sony 51 setup plugged via hdmi get sound  ‚Äô plugged earbuds seems work  issue move speakers obviously ‚Äô get turned around sound ‚Äô match  besides works playing tv
works correctly nonvr games  remember change setting ps5 get 51 system working correctly  ca nt remember specifically  home check   seems work way vr 
game manage make work gt7  since guess ¬´ directional sound ¬ª huge home theater disappointed playing psvr2 games sound‚Ä¶ understand directional sound  gt7 center channel cranked amazing  cause feel vibrations engine  immersion better 3d headset 
game needs support  games  resident evil village example  locks game stereo vr mode 
522 setup  order get audio come open game toggle pass onoff  nothing plugged headset audio jack  works great pistol whip  gt 7 8 
hmmm  well clearly everyone luck  whatever reason  m currently getting surround either  though nt checked signal format game running  might gamedependant  d prefer playing speakers given headphones means less sweating  especially ca nt find smaller earclip headphones  especially pavlov directional audio would certainly help  got ta specifically test offline mode next time m playing  although m using pcm moment since avr outdated nt support 4k  therefore hdmi cable goes ps5  sources  directly lg oled tv sound avr  surround sound work fine like streaming content  flat  games s real reason nt work vr well far setup concerned 
exactly  ve meaning ask  surely s need 3d simulated stereo 51 speakers actually around real life s moves around case speakers  surely  51 work least well nonvr games  anyone tried  ll go weekend  gt7 needs tunes cranking  remote control spotify phone running background ps5 play   engine sounds ace big room filling sound 
absolutely 71 functions perfectly psvr2 games  output pcm directly avr 
according another commenter last week  audio setting works playing flat games vr  actual vr games 
audio output settings hdmi  mine set pcm 71 goes directly avr  want use headphones  select audio output quick settings output headphones   happen arctis nova pros  love ‚Äô much nicer things head 
wo nt work  receiver shows dts vr turn  moment turn vr  automatically switch stereo receiver 
play sound speakers s stereo 
 also functional much better 71 setup 
op nt ask 3d audio  simulated vertical positioning   s possible simulate directional audio horizontal plane 5171 systems people done decades 
wrong
exactly  ‚Äô understand people talking butt 
got dts surround flat screen vr  missing 
kind setup  old onkyo 709 connected tv via arc  perhaps users direct connection ps5 home theater system works surround sound  mine  dumbs stereo audio 
got sound s stereo  71 dolby atmos setup  playing gt7 without vr got dts surround  turn vr automatically switch stereo 
sure happening  output pcm directly avr 
idk games support surround sound 
ps5 tv avr could def reason  def switch pcm see tv let audio pass
üòÇ yeah tried saying weeks ago various people arguing ‚Äô wrap tiny minds around fact headphones mounted head therefore move requires apparent audio sources positions moved accordingly speakers placed around  sounds come rotating head works normal life  ‚Äô complicated 
good news everyone saying otherwise full shit  works perfect 71 setup 
wrong
every day  ‚Äô amazing worlds better headphones 
think ‚Äô ‚Äô audio video main ps5 menu‚Ä¶ weird 
probably set lpcm  imagine dts introducing problem  edit  audio output settings
pioneer receiver  ps5 plugged tv 
helps sound settings liner pcm  hdmi device type  av amplifier number channels 51 definitely get sound speakers  including sub  im savvy speaker tech give much input  know turned around sounds left coming right  next time ‚Äô vr check sound setting see anything changes  saying experiencing  wish input sorry 
tv ca nt pcm stereo  nt see vr games would use different audio stream flat games seeing audio output format via hdmi systemwide setting ps5  playing vr could course connect ps5 directly avr since nt need tv loop time  d bit much hassle go back forth every time switching flat vr since aside cable switching would need change ps5 settings well  still  might least test way nothing else helps 
‚Äô works amazing  hearing many idiots saying ‚Äô work pleased report dumb af
 stupid question  17year old sony 51 work well newer 71  right 
changed lpcm  definitely expanded center speaker using surrounds sounds nt track headset turn around 
hmm hdmi input 
yes   assume  video video audio  dvd  video 2  monitor  audiospecific inputs  know hdmi also carries audio  prefer optical dedicated audio input  adapter changes hdmi optical reason  adapter  might wrong word  m pro  m quite sure system nt optimized  sadly long since lost track owner s manual surround system 
apparently psvr2 support positional audio via surround speakers
nt seen mentioned anywhere else  sorry missed   df said video actually let use surround sound speakers position audio relative headset  great news  way better using cheap headphones  check section 16 minutes  https  youtubexuzrdlyo1tq
push need finally get rear speakers fixed
want wish folks shit people asking positional audio speaker setups pleasant day 
s great  headphones nt connecting initially  sound played tv speakers set headphones worked switched psvr2  much better sound coming people watching 
s good  normally play facing tv 
big question know rotational position relative room  obviously room tracking  nt seen anything indicate knows absolute location tv speakers  looking forward playing around  s done well could really awesome  really want ability use headphones subwoofer  best worlds
good news  everyone 
hooray  nice surround sound system game room  nt thrilled prospect using headphones 
anyone got working  received psvr2  audio output seems able headset  possibility override  d like use psvr2 without headphones  like used psvr1
anyone tell actually enable  71 system already sound output set dts  also tried dolby   works great flat games  system still switches pcm stereo soon psvr games fired  found setting psvr2 menu move sound related screen  nt think s people referring  ca nt find settings related system psvr2 settings  one thing note  using surround receiver prior arc earc  means ca nt pass surround via pcm  might limiting factor 
s really weird inconsistent get working  turn vr2  audio system turns  turn wireless headphones  external speakers turn    guess mirror audio anyone watching play   turn headphones back    speakers stay  s even weirder  also seems detect m wearing vr headset  turns speakers put headset  always  sometimes  wtf 
‚Äô see appeal  way surround set positioned usually front  near tv  best sound  turn  sound come speakers usually bit less quality  also  people soundbar stop talking altogether  use good headphones best sound ‚Äô get  especially noise canceling 
unable assign output receiver psvr2 settings  worked setup  üò¢ denon 6700h 15 speaker surround  3 height channels  dual subs  would nice psvr2 would play nicely ü§û
make work  love using speakers psvr really used playing game silently psvr2  mind  im deaf  spend hour two setting trying make work  couldnt figured  feedbacks 
ve experimented set get 51 surround sound work speakers  audio play front speakers  without headphones plugged  sony needs fix like others mentioned would much rather use  1500 surround sound setup even nice pair headphones  idea thought disabling surround sound would good idea 
ca nt working either  bound headphone output soon headset turned  really annoying
sony wearable neck speaker wo nt work sony psvr 2 s conected sony bravia tv  wtf works fine psvr 1 course
f u  ‚Äô life get audio come tv even headphones unplugged 
knows speakers relative forwards  s normal surround works tv  nt think know  direction facing  forwards  vr relative room  unless step like steamvr ask point tv  perhaps assume set  forwards  vr facing tv 
ss awesome headphones usually sound better gaming  ss seems lose details 
 could get audio speakers  nt seem rotate headset  think digital foundry may specifically talking cinematic screen audio  s place toggle mentioned 
nt think exists unfortunately  think df talking cinematic screen  without explicitly saying 
ve seen weird audio glitches also  sure s  hopefully fix  quite annoying vr games nt come 51 receiver  2channel  think happened psvr1 also  still annoying  sigh 
personally surround speakers sonos ones  pretty handy capable driving fairly decent sound  also get benefit proper bass  much nicer built headphones  agree top range headphones sound better  bit hassle set  also lot expensive nt already 
good home theatre setup surrounds better speakers general  ‚Äô another option prefer larger sound stage  frequency response depth headphones reproduce  sure might enable crappy 2 bit sound bar  ‚Äô  let happy  https  wwwredditcomrpsvrcomments11850w6headphonesaregreatbuthavingpositionalaudio  utmsourceshare  utmmediumiosapp  utmnameiossmf guy instance gets

tried using jbl quantum tws wireless earbuds last night  found able keep headset sweet spot longer  wearing pulse3d seems shift psvr2 headset slightly  probably ‚Äô adjusting slightly comfort  ‚Äô ‚Äô trying see audio solution could work  sadly ‚Äô index audio  
problem pulse headset  made japanese market primarily  also go tgr arctic 7 nt fit headset
guess goes show different head shapes eyes  lol arctis 7s sit exactly head need psvr2 sit  kinda lock place   mostly sitting  sure would motion  ll never really know mostly disabled  lol

really   arctic 7s fit mine perfectly way vr headset sits head  must nasty hard build equipment many different body shapes  consumers need companies start making customizable equipment something

sound quality  pulse 3d vs default earbuds
answer tried please  terms sound quality  ‚Äô interested mic function  interested comfortable long play‚Ä¶etc  view poll   https  wwwredditcompoll12etn07 
im audiophile even tell difference two  big difference playing pavlov listening footsteps  also lot convenient volume controls headset 
bought pulse 3d easier alternative included buds  s honestly game changer expecting  volume level noticably lower comparatively buds  chat volume way fyi   s possible spoiled beyerdynamic 1990 pro s  quality nt advanced d like price point  wish could use beyer s  providing adequate power drive headset trouble s worth 
pulse 3d nt comfortable head longer 45 minutes   head tall  plastic top ring rubs skull  would hope would nt happen softer strap next damn hurts
pulse much better even better options better sound larger format  want go balls wall quality  get audeze penrose  planar driver  connects ps5 time connects phone via bluetooth  ‚Äô cheap though mic quality meh  far audiophile grade sound though  ‚Äô beat 
kinda dumb question  hundred dollar headset better five dollar earbuds 
realize s different headphones pulse 3ds  pulse 3ds terrible mic quality re worth buying  yes pretty much quality headphones better included earbuds 
‚Äô night day honestly  arguing whether pulse 3d puts best quality overall among headsets might different  pulse 3ds really good especially compatibility regarding fitment 
pulses good loads better fit better ear cushions 
sennheiser hd599 üôèüèº sound million times better headphones come vr headset definitely recommend anyones looking good headphones buy
s even close
pulse 3d equalizer audio setting  highly suggest turning settings  sounds way better 
new maxwell sound better really good mic  get instead
cushiond fit  find original small ears 
 fit well headset 
try today  far  ve turned bass boost feature  thanks tip 
good know  ‚Äô fan strap audeze  maxwell  dual connection option 
used geekria ones  similar size originals though softer  comfier 
turned settings 6  left low treble 5 mainly play online shooters  footsteps pretty important hear
thanks  ll check 
anyone notice change pistol whips sound 
two factors changed since last played pistol whip   reset ps5 factory settings  pistol whip update booted pistol whip first time since update reset  something feels sound  previously  reloading gun satisfying  loved  tonight  sound ‚Äô super faint  feels directional  like ‚Äô hip pretty faint  reload next ear  ‚Äô closer  ‚Äô like  ‚Äô wondering update changed something  maybe ‚Äô ps setting ‚Äô sorted since reset  ‚Äô play 3d audio configurations ‚Äô headphones plugged time  ‚Äô using normal buds came headset  thought ‚Äô check fellow vr peeps  thanks
definitely screwed audio haptics  ‚Äô playing pistol whip almost every day since launch psvr2  ‚Äô gotten used nuances haptics  reload audio seems mainly come right ear right hand left ear left  also sounds distant  haptics reload basically anymore slight rumble comes way later reload finishes  also firing gun makes pretty distinct tinging noise  presumably imitate sound shell casing   today first time stopped playing 2 levels ‚Äô really enjoying   would pass level start finish bed  ‚Äô actually quite disappointed played game past month  hope go back previous patch totally fine 
pistol whip one first games played launch  psvr2   went back couple days ago also felt like felt quieter  could nt say sure probably 2 weeks since played feel seemed quieter  also using buds come headset 
received noftication hopped today pistol whip updated version  1000002 think might bugged patch 
something odd playthrough today  switch onear headphone  never  see could get better sound  nt work thought mind playing tricks 
yes  something reloads sounded today  nt played days ca nt say happened
yeah feel ‚Äô quiet  switch synth rider pistol whip  bump volume quite bit 
nt notice update  thought thing bounties afternoon 
perhaps changed eq settings 
m gon na go ahead say  muh  placebo    somebody  nt feel nice  people  
thanks reply  exactly experienced  checked google ‚Äô believe people ‚Äô talking  amazing impact haptics good audio making game fun pistol whip  hopefully revert changes 
‚Äô recall changing prior reset  ‚Äô possible  played cod lot different headsets last 6 months since last factory reset  ‚Äô look see anything feels familiar  thanks reply

audio bugs extension cord 
hi  recently bought short angled usbc extension cable  20cm  protect usb port case someone trips vr2 cable  upper usba port occupied receiver dongle ps4 gold headphones  everything workes fine  except sound gaps like 1 second every 10 15 seconds   1 extension interfere dongle  2 ado usb ports front power supply  2b extension cord cause higher energy demand  3 could extension cable defective 
https  oldredditcomrpsvrcomments12bx7j7pulse3daudioissueswhileusingpsvr2
wonder like unshielded something s causing wireless interference  would suggest maybe moving dongle another port away adapter  even put extension get farther away everything

huh really positive video person pretty high standards headphones atleast  like way summed saying got money laying around kinda fence  buy  nt money chill wait 
egg bag
sound psvr2
spent time tinkering audio settings nothing fixed audio issue  checked input output psvr2 still audio headset  anyone know fix 
matter selecting correct audio output  yeah  well  bt headset standard gaming vr use little earbuds  put vr could nt hear anything  turned audio output still set headset even though nt day  manually select vr2 output worked 
headphones still plugged controller 
psvr2 3d audio settings
3d audio work plugging headphones jack headset  3d audio settings greyed inaccessible using psvr2 way  using default 3d audio profile specific psvr2 using settings set options greyed  s latter  setup really advise go check right 3d profile set ears continuing 
try going 3d audio settings right boot psvr2 without launching game  havehad problem unaccessible 3d audio settings usb dongle use audio going settings right booting psvr2 made available whatever reason  3d audio works though  greyed 
3d audio settings greyed stock earbuds attached 
think ‚Äô enable 3d audio plug dualsense  give options  hopefully someone test proper though  spent 2 minutes trying lol
settings using though  settings set nt greyed something else  settings greyed regardless ve booted game 
yup 
‚Äô correct 
thinking possibility sound like basic stereo 
got arctis 7p went settings  also noticed setting greyed  unavailable using psvr2 headset  however  unplugged earbuds  wonder removing earbuds using headset would make difference 
pavlov  directional audio
psvr2 pavlov regarding audio  seems audio way  like ll follow gunshots lead edge map gunfire sounds like s coming outside map  thought spinning around vr tv displaying video headset nt audio match  breaking brain thinking issue  game never directional audio  ve got decent 71 setup like apex legends cod titles clearly tell direction go hear footsteps particular direction hoping 
think sound direction needs little work  footsteps sound like ‚Äô next room sometimes
even 3d audio headset  footsteps left right depending looking  direction sound others seems fine  ‚Äô goes walls floors  ‚Äô tell ‚Äô 
wait  using tv s 71 surround sound directional audio  using headphones  ask surround sound setups built directional audio coming console  sound nt rotate rotate
far thing complain game  thought  really bad 
ps5 even sweet speaker placement setup 
footsteps sound like 2 meters behind 
even headphones  directional audio way 
yeah  ve learn follow people  ca nt tell someone following start shooting lol
yeah footsteps sometimes sound like side even behind  one devs said look way  aware 
think big problem hope game makers change  lease message
yeah  often feels like m walking next  weird experience 
fucking hate sounds sound  s thing dislike game  got used little still sometimes hear footsteps  turn around  realize fucking legs get shot opposite direction lol 
m different person ve tried included earbuds  71 surround system headphones  make footsteps sound like left behind 
yes  headphones  generally time use apex chat s mono earcup style open air design allow maximum sound passthrough s opposite 15 year experience ps xbox hooked receiver dolby digital  always rotates  like playing cod helicopter lands infront spin circles sound circles around 
25 bucks m mad  outstanding gameplay vr mechanics  gladly pay 5060 pavlov 2 better directional audio
m often looking around see s following  realize
yeah ‚Äô definitely happen  need keep footsteps fixed central point  sure need ping around soundstage
yes  believe said directional audio surround sound vr work way standard gaming  probably extra axis head tilt compared standard fps camera
lost sound options 
recent update life get psvr2 output sound surround sound system s turned  defaults headset  plugged even turned  options avalable longer show av system normal  moved controls somewhere something   currently one s watching someone play something hear anything get anything play anything headphones 
use option play sound surround sound system work 3d sound  works without problem  like sound tv stream 
noticed thing   audio would come speakers headphones want take headphones still hear s going game around  audio ever wants go headphones even unplugging suckers  ca nt find settings change  alone 
71 surround sound system s really good get really nice surround tuner like use hanging people take turns gt7 whoever nt driving least hear s happening driver hear others room talk 
s really weird  ve never run sound tuner headphones time  would interesting option 
index style audio psvr2  anyone tried  ordered 
""
‚Äô interested  ear buds lack bass  big sony headphones awkward fit
 work perfectly sound better  s much easier share  pass headset others well 
feel like could massive improvement earbuds included headset
like  floating headphones take bit getting used  something rammed ears helps get headaches  things dislike cable long bit mess  headset wo nt fit box clipped  need take store  small head  also prevent adjusting headset s smallest position take couple centimeters side headband  s problem  overall m really glad 
nt bit immersion breaking vr gaming  mean  hear cars driving  dogs barking  sirens  kids playing outside screaming yelling vr  pulse 3d pretty much shuts sound real world
bionic mantis ‚Äú index ‚Äù style  onear headphones  ear drivers 
wishwonder bone conduction headphones would work ps5psvr2 
psvr 1 great 
using work fine  collective minds charging stand  make sure click extended position otherwise hit sense controllers 
psvr1  liked  ‚Äô tried psvr2 yet cause pulse  blows every solution tried vr  apart index  ‚Äô decide like  pulse way go  voice pas hear cat decides attack
still kinda fiddly  sort hover ear still touching ear know mean  might head shape  wish would sit ear  ca nt bring closer  pretty good sound quality  wanted good headphones keep attached headset works well
valve index s audio set considered gold standard vr uses speaker set rather isolating headphones 
yeah  pulse makes sense  fully supported indefinitely reasonable price wise

uh s gon na different vr audio years available pc 
 although ps5 using hrtf localization flat games moment  positioning fixed ingame avatar  feb 22 forwards   obviously s going non vr game  based character movement else going major disconnect would nt make sense game like returnal based position irl would nt getting anything stereo audio unless re moving around irl  psvr 2 advantage  common sense lmao yes tempest audio good  s really binaural audio nothing new sounds like fanboy stuff
hate using 3d audio  manly play apex overwatch games already version 3d audio sounds bad sony s 3d

play vr games face forward like beat saber type games
surround systems simply ‚Äô work vr  moment turn room audio image ‚Äô fit anymore 
doesnt work vr  unless face tv 100  time 
thanks everyone  already sony xm4 headphones hoping work well psvr2 
reasons others stated  using a9 psvr2 ‚Äô ideal  otherwise  system fantastic  sw5 sub using 65 ‚Äù a80j acoustic center  amazing  problem ‚Äô need apple music subscription access atmos music  listening habits likely change listening stereo music like watching tv black white sound bubble really good claimed
correct m wrong starting game ps vr2 71 system virtual menu spot actual tv  ps vr2 setup able track menu case would location physical tv  turn 90¬∞ right system could realize ve turned virtual space middle right channel receive audio would play center channel front right would play front left audio rear right would play front right audio  turn right 90¬∞ game using sticks head remains physical position  sound hearing front rotate system 90¬∞ left  unless m missing something  system keep track head position rotate channels accordingly also keep track thumb sticks used rotate sound stage well 
d probably work great rig system move head  cheap easy way speaker setup knew ears positioned times followed around 
nah  ‚Äô got maxed hta7000 sw5 sars5s 360 spatial audio well  ‚Äô amazing even non vr ps games 71 rather atmos  ‚Äô like normal surround rather 3d  although kind fill upper space algorithmic magic ‚Äô great full atmos 
talks home theatre around 1620 video https  youtubexuzrdlyo1tq
‚Äô need account head turning really ‚Äô moving head ears attached  sound would coming fixed positions around  like real world 
s trippy actual molded ears 
wow  super interesting  days try irl  ü§©
sound system also ‚Äô turn head begin 
probably need bluetooth audio dongle connect ps5 ‚Äô bizarre reason 
ahh would cool experience  think ve sold  happen know video streaming services support atmos  like could watch stranger things atmos  ü§îü¶ë
lol
really helpful  wish sony would adopt atmos ps5  guessing licencing hella expensive 
really helpful thank  discussion seems go everyone else saying thread 
still would need account positional audio unless ‚Äô walking vr game ‚Äô always fixed point  ‚Äô walking  soon turn head around  180¬∞  original position walk forward game  sounds coming left environment heard speakers right
ya turn head right channel longer right channel  s rear channel example 
ahhh  makes sense  awesome experience 3d audio tech psvr2 days ü§©
even better  capture audio 360 degrees heard human ears   3d binaural microphone   https  techcrunchcomwpcontentuploads201404binaural3dmicrophoneheadjpg 
curious  end  sony brava tv sony ht7 dolby atmos surround setup  yesterday realized vr2s bought one looking see invest pulse cans use surround setup  another set cans   thanks advance 
would ruin games movies running tv
would need  surround works perfectly normal games audio moves speaker speaker turn arpund ingame 
 bizarre reason  latency 
bizarre  using audio cable xm4 plug directly psvr2 
need connect psvr
yes  stranger things atmos  netflix supports  disney  peacock  hbo max  amazon prime video  apple tv  showtime  including many others  support titlebytitle basis  ‚Äô  list netflix shows   https  hdreportcomlistof4kultrahdmoviestvshowsonnetflix  movies  sure current  support atmos almost every hd bluray title supports atmos well  xbox series x pc  ps5 uses proprietary tempest audio tech  weirdly enough  since systems sony   a9 excellent job enable 71 audio support settings ‚Äô care one whit top gun  maverick absolute referencequality movie atmos  like said  changes watch listen 
yeah wish would  seems mad expensive sony kit console ‚Äô use fully  still sounds great although barely turn 30  100  start getting complaints neighbour üòÜ
atmos ‚Äô change thing discussion though 
even licensing  people atmos would gladly pay  20 unlock
happen test already 
well yeah normal games manage fine ‚Äô  ‚Äô account using sticks  character movement  rotation like always games
imagine ‚Äô vr simulation room ‚Äô  surround system  character front talking  comes centre channel  turn head right  image shows looking right room  sound coming left rotated head away centre channel‚Ä¶  people seem forgetting headphones attached head speakers ‚Äô üòÇ night night
looks like would fit right switchback monsters 
well  obviously  point ‚Äô also reason ‚Äô work vr lol 
works great avantree dg60
work also
cable perfect
says  pulse 3d works  wireless dongle‚Ä¶ 
yet unfortunately  spent  games ll wait weeks
yea ‚Äô turn around  always face tv  case vr  literally turn body around speaker ‚Äô set ‚Äú left ‚Äù speaker would right
talking surround sound system  headphones  s problem 
‚Äô gon na retract comment turn answer dunno
would rubbish surround systems really intended represent sound field way  consumed facing  sound coming front turned around would behind ‚Ä¶ ‚Äô see ‚Äô work  ‚Äô headphones need move sound sources around account head rotation ‚Äô actually head 
ok well people either trolling severe learning disabilities ‚Äô figure ‚Äô difference speakers attached head moves vs fixed position relative head head movement changes ear position relative sound source  ‚Äô really difficult  long sound field matched player considers forwards could turn around fine  ‚Äô ears work anyway  honestly tedious
would work ‚Äô walk game  think  walk game  ‚Äô walk real life ‚Äô new sound outputs coming wrong direction surround system  unless face way original position  character front speaking  sound come front speaker  perfect  turn around without walking  sound come front speaker  behind  still character behind  perfect   analog stick walk forward bit see new character time talk  sound still come front speaker  even though ‚Äô behind new sound outputs coming direction original position facing surround system make front speaker responsible  perfect  try get psvr2 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
yeah exactly said used sticks etc move character game world ‚Äô move sound sources surround field accommodate already 2d games  everyone kept talking head rotation tracking said part would unneccessary  place hard work load nothing ‚Äô  maybe try reading post understand ‚Äô saying
think misunderstood original comment replied  neonridr essentially said surround sound system ‚Äô positional audio making optimal vr  true  replied saying ‚Äô need account head turning  false  seems like thought talking headphones  neonridr basically saying ‚Äú surround system bad ‚Äù  implying ‚Äú headphones good ‚Äù vr  seems agree replied neonridr disagreed confusing ‚Äô edited comments conversations ‚Äô even make sense lol
say head turning mean user turning actual head  game  anyway ‚Äô done ‚Äô boring
working parts original  beloved  cv1 soon new home  psvr2 audio solution 
""
im going try mantis headphones psvr2  sound quality poor  think use pulse 3d daily driver 
‚Äô cool idea  think ‚Äô eventually market solutions like available psvr2 honest 
vr ears rebuff reality psvr im hoping fit ok  love ear solution like previous index
may recommend velcro cable ties instead plastic zip ties 
akg made ear headphones o  sound quality deliver excellent  m sure akg nt ventured market mantis  m sure could make good profit s real competition 
dude fuck 
look like giant earbuds 
yeah  mantis earphones good  pair pulse headphones  decent   ll try rift one s first flip throw psvr2 without additional hassle  see get 
yeah mantis massive disappointment  seemed like great solution sent back tried sounded worse standard psvr ear buds  hopefully ll see something form factor released psvr2 actually sounds decent 
anyone else audio level issues horizon 
‚Äô using bose qc35s wired connection  ‚Äô really trouble hearing dialogue npcs  like initial boat scene boat safari  anything else onscreen ‚Äô hear word ‚Äô saying  another example hear someone needing help ‚Äô higher mountain  could hardly hear  let alone direction  one cutscenes hub characters talking  tried turning around audio position unchanged  tried changing game audio settings  reducing music vfx volume makes game quiet  overall audio seems quieter games  anyone else  troubleshooting suggestions  games seem fine  gt7  re8  moss

bought black pulse 3d vr2 white one ‚Äô available back  recently exchanged black white one feel ‚Äô slight difference volume output  black pulse headset ‚Äô volume slightly louder one  may significant difference still one tad bit bothers  yes  settings correct  game volume high  chat zero  eq settings also  could 
think black one released white one  maybe improved
settings could either kind variance improve later models  weird d get old stock white though  d imagine sell 
would imagine sort hardware revision two models  could also possible parts used different batches mfg locations could different due availability  ‚Äô case would source similar parts  different mfg parts slight variances 
drivers ‚Äô broken yet  speakers get louder break  bet compared new new  new used lot use  ‚Äô different

use dg60 dongle athm50xbt headphones volume buttons headphones  loads better  surprisingly comfy  bit annoying take built ones sound loads better

surround sound  dolby atmos 
hello guys  ordered psvr2  thought headphones psvr comes  dedicated home theatre dolby atmos sound  gaming chair situated  gt7   question need use headphones use rooms sound  losing anything immersion perspective 
sony proprietary 3d audio  dolby atmos ‚Äô supported ps5 
gt7 probably game external audio work well due completely static
also room use headphones fits vr 3d audio best  gt7 might well system though walking around talking people generell ‚Äô much different sounds coming different directions 
71 atmos home theater  works great psvr 2 nothing beats good pair noise cancelling  ear headphones  use home theatre friends playing  use headphones 
hoping option could find  notice switching game vr  changes audio output home theater 3 main channels  tried looking sound output option let select vr headphones another wireless adaptor using another headset 
use headphones  speakers turn 
decent home theater speaker setup  use  perfect gt7  compared headphones fake 3d audio  well quite shit  lol 
happy cake day
recommend ps5 ones earbuds psvr2 comes 
actually  tested digital foundry
lmao nothing fake  even calibrate hrtf 
tested  still prefer 71 system  could definitely hear differences appreciate 3d really gives audio sources true presence absent 71 system  like sound coming  ultimately sound sounded tinny liking compressed dynamic range nt like wear headphones anyway 
fine highly recommend something good frequency ranges like sony wh1000xm3  want feel bass especially rhythm games engines gt7  ps5 pulse well ‚Äô taken another level noise cancelling  premium headphones 
get nice pair dunu iems  ‚Äô thank later

nt  turn head audio sources turn surround sound system  example  person speaks behind  sound comes rear speakers  turn around  sound shifts front speakers effectively still comes behind  even though m facing speaking person  turn virtually game break surround sound  happens almost games  psvr1 games supported home theaters properly  ca nt lock sound  settings work cinema mode headphones 
recall watching ‚Äô sure currently working  one person sub reported surround sound ‚Äô enabled system defaulting headphone  2 channel setup right able confirm audio output changing headphone automatically headset  ‚Äô way change could see  system level  also easily verifiable re8 audio settings screen ‚Äú headphones ‚Äù selected grayed  even ‚Äô headphones plugged  sure ‚Äô bug way ‚Äô intended tbh  sounds nice like dial sound ‚Äô really particular sound setup‚Ä¶ find information ‚Äô really like know

direct answer question psvr1 support wireless mode pulse headphones   tried  ‚Äô seen several pictures taken press ces people using psvr2 pulse headsets  sure wired wireless edit  hard discern careful looking pictures taken ces‚Ä¶ pretty much sure wired pulse headsets vr2  shame  basically  0 comes sound psvr12 headphone jack tvexternal speakers 1 using pulse headsets wireless mode  tv external speakers stops sound  2 pulse headset wired work psvr12 3 whatever headphone used vrs sound come tvspeakers
wow ‚Äô know confirmed  cheers 
good know  cheers  would shame wireless tv sound together ‚Äô work reason bought pulse headset less wires  guess ‚Äô need tv sound friends
pulse wired probably due fact 24ghz band likely runs would super packed ces  also multiple demos time m sure s many channels headsets run  rather deal headache press complaining audio cutting  wired  nt use earbuds obvious reasons 
believe wireless ‚Äô work psvr 1 due breakout box ‚Äô issue psvr 2 feel may wired psvr 2 demo thing many electronics things wired better sake demo perhaps 
well ‚Äô pretty sure psvr 1 works right

ah  good point  3d audio processed discretely psvr  forgot  make sense  like said  might radio confusion issue  handson articles journalists invited sony hq clearly show combination vr2 wireless pulse 
never used wireless headset psvr 1 wired got pulse headset specifically go wireless psvr 2 ‚Äô sure right though psvr 2 sent reviewers ‚Äô sure get answers soon
absolute legend  thank much sharing  really appreciate 
‚Äô pretty sure even wires headphones psvr1 still sent audio tv

3d audio wont work psvr2 wireless turn head source changes direction  3d audio without wired psvr2

someone mentioned elswhere change pcm options audio tried  makes miss optical ps4

ve issue  yet find solution 
yea  headphones disconnected 
ever headphones plugged  issue plugged unplugged 
way improve audio psvr2 
anybody opinions experience audio playing games  earbuds comes ok  kind drown dialogue  pair jabra eliete s use via bluetooth sound garbled  plug using audio jack nt get loud enough  thoughts  thanks
using pulse 3d headphones issues 
pulse 3d excellent companion psvr2 
kind blows bought jabra elietes months back use playing games ps5 sounds great  reason suck psvr2 
use apple earbuds sound great 
change audio mix usually game also ps settings  headphones nt good enough ps5 highly recommend pulse 3d  sound great seems like sony already knew design psvr2 fits perfectly headphones support headset quite good 
pulse 3d probably best option convenient since headphones set custom audio profiles equalizer settings menu  pulse 3d sony headphones make custom audio profiles ps5  least case last time checked 
seem louder stock earbuds 
1  bought old headphones issues volume audio quality pulse headsets really good  also fits really well psvr2 helps keep position sweet spot 
agreed  nt even care test inear went straight pulse 3d  think call mountain made pulse 3d  gt7  sound awesome pulse 3d  autumn 2022  sony used pulse 3d early psvr2 reviews  think psvr2 made work pulse 3d  pulse 3d earpads slightly push stabilize hmd  works great

‚Äô actually misconception  many called 3d sound headsets actually sound worse simple headphones earbuds  sony ‚Äô pulse 3ds optimised though 
‚Äô absolutely advisable chose best 3 hrtf options ears 
 nt need anything like  nt setup  plug earbuds headset works automatically

re right  ve tried psvr2 support game 51 without headphones  sound play speakers 20 sony really needs fix would much rather use rather expensive home theater even nice headphones 
51 works well  highend denon avr  paradigm speakers sound much better using earbuds  finally use home theater system vr  unlike quest 2 wish sony would add dolby atmos speaker support  4 speakers 
51 dolby digital system  nt support lpcm surround via earc   surround work either psvr2 connected  solutions  sure hear discrete multichannel lpcm earc 
‚Äô tv audio ‚Äô using  agree  rearprojecting flat screen audio systems garbage   51 system satellite speakers gaming area  provides excellent immersion normal gaming sessions  realize maybe head tracked 3d provided headphones probably much better  curious ‚Äô option find 
yeah headphones ‚Äú one thing ‚Äù makes setup cumbersome  also makes head real hot

ll want use headphones immersion  use surround sound wo nt good using headphones precision 3d audio  even though might counterintuitive think purpose surround setup  come earbuds  high quality headphones use 
nt sir  use headphones 
use headphones  3d audio superior surround sound turning head different directions 
nooo  even psvr1 could entirely use normal speakers  even headphones  others said people watching social screen normal tv output 
work  course  one actually explaining ‚Äô good idea  somewhat work orient facing directly toward center speaker  need recalibrate reorient screen playing  unless fix orientation facing center speaker throw direction sound  ‚Äô also miss height low sounds  direction  bass  speakers outside atmos ‚Äô capable filling void  even 3d capable surround sound system  games likely ‚Äô support outside headphones 
m sure folks see sacrilege  primarily done psvr1 gaming using surround stereo setup  definitely good good 3d audio headphones  allowed still able communicate people house  far preferable  audio change move around speakers turn head  s terribly accurate  probably using headphones much psvr2  imagine lot head haptics tuned work adjacent audio  would probably much less impressive sound nt right ears 
ve playing psvr since launch exclusively surround system  yes  surround sound accurate turn head  mostly nt problem  naturally enveloping sound  low deep rumble system create far superior headphones  least setup  yes ve tried decent headphones well  funny thing  games seem account directionality sound nt break turn head  played paper beast  room vr recently could accurately pinpoint sound sources turn head without breaking sound directionality  also prefer nt wear additional weight head thus prolonging play sessions  understand reason headphones  m going try psvr2 m pretty sure ll go back surround system  trying tempest 3d audio ps5 walking back unimpressed  sound indeed 3d  subjectively sounded tinny heavily compressed dynamic range  tried dt 770 pro   could get bespoke hrtfs  hinted cerny  might solve 
used psvr1 atmos 724 speaker setup  playing beat saber awesome feel ground shake underneath  atmos speakers good job simulating block flying animations around loud music 
pulse headphones ever since ‚Äô bought notice frequencies  wish lows  mess settings still  3d works great  sound quality ‚Äô 100 sennheiser headphones amazing use music  best headphones owned 
3d audio nt supported surround sound systems  doubt 
‚Äô even think external audio supported  iirc use headphones 
headphones blasting home cinema feel bass 
think athm50x able fit hmd 
sorry  got fancy
headphones fake surround garbage compared dedicated speaker setup  case vr necessary turn head 
thank  ‚Äô answer looking  ü§ò
beat saber likely cool thumping surround system  since head really moving much around game  would nt play something 3d oriented without headphones  say like blood truth
might set way  feel like pulse headphones missing uuhmf 
likely yes  based ve read headphones tried  hard know certain s specific comments  find annoying major review outlets talk supposed use either earbuds come sony headset  s options  s lousyrushed reviewing 
looks certain s  yes   question headphones answered  https  pressstartcomaufeatures20230216yourburningplaystationvr2questionsanswered  sfmcid696060278
s  72 surround setup  vr  use headphones  one  headphones use built 3d audio processing  two  re surround sound audio adjust head position orientation 
‚Äô ‚Äô fancy  ‚Äô ‚Äô missing quite bit immersion totally shut outer world 
hey raudiophile  sewage leak
blasting big speakers feel shooting body vr even immersive 
thanks mate üòä
re welcome 
psvr2 chat audio tv 
m sure possible  chat audio come tv surround sound  believe head unit mic  yes  headphones plugged  still talk party  chat audio come tv  could figure life last night 
ca nt believe sony really insisting  first letting us output tvavr using dualsense  re doubling  love assume everyone enjoys wearing headphones  drives crazy  guess plus side s discord let literally anything want inputoutputs  problem inconvenient moment  getting friends join like pulling teeth  dumbass problem s really putting damper enjoyment best immersive gaming experience  remove features ps4 psvr let us   
game chat come tv crossplay games use game audio game chat 
party wo nt work though obvious reasons  nt way change 
ok party chat ca nt done way  ingame chat 
 obvious  reasons  seems stupid arbitrary removed features previous console 
ps4 nt allow party chat tv headphones time 
sure  nt know s op referring  nt see anyone would need  m referring fact ps4 allowed output chat audio tv using built mic camera psvr  whereas ps5 nt allow output tv using dualsense mic psvr 2 mic stupid reason pisses end 
star wars  games  play even better musicsoundtrack turned  especially 3d audio 
""
playing star wars game turned background music  totally different experience  much realistic could hear enemies sounds clearly  fights felt intense well  anyone else done games 
remember people saying skyrim vr music nice never wanted turn   phenomenal  traversing wilds  especially  becomes whole new adventure since enemy attacks telegraphed soundtrack kicking 
wild  love ost star wars   maybe try blaster fights 
yeah  canyon area sneaking around attacking bad guys fun way  also helps finding collectibles hear clearly  plus nt realize much noise droids make music background 
anyone else get tinny audio switching psvr2 game cinema mode media app 
played vr audio tinny sounding bass  changed audio options settings luck  thought maybe broke headphones tried phone  good new  eventually playing vr games went back normal idea happened 
happens seldomly usually launch game  hit home screen sound iike normal  thing restart game worked every time  felt like something headset cord moved hope early
update get sound tv anymore  anyone else problem knows fix 
wanted play re8 girlfriend likes watch suffer tv  update sound headphones psvr 2 tv  update get sound headphones  tv sound anymore  extremely stupid girlfriend ca nt watch anymore nt want play alone  searched options ca nt change audio device something else headphones  even headphones plugged  edit  fixed  idea ve done 
find whole tv soundvideo bit buggy honest  today sound disappear ingame  restarted console  lost image tv well  went game came back time  ‚Äô really figure triggering 
yeah  sometimes lose image well  resetting ps5 worked every time far
weird  ‚Äô wireless headset usb plugged  update ‚Äô changed anything concerning sound tv 
seems way  started playing subtitles suddenly sound worked  problem monitoring feature headphones ca nt disabled  use pulse headset 
monitoring feature  lost quick headphone sound setting main menu bar  something tells going see updates soon enough 
could nt find either  monitoring headphones feature let s hear surrounding trough microphone  s feature normally used recording studios  producers voice actors check music  voice  pulse headset integrated seems always enabled psvr 2  incredibly annoying want immerse someone around watches tv  ca nt shut headphones anymore  
left psvr2 controler makes sound press grip  anyone know 
""
like video 
send unit back
30 days
sounds like haptic sensor got stuck  nt sound great  still function 
 brought month ago pre ordee
""
yes dose m scared
first call sony  worried 
wish vr headsets bone conduction headphones built  psvr2 audio time 
ve thinking lot lately wish vr headsets bone conduction headsets built  built headset  would remove need earbuds ear headphones extra cables  work making bones face jaw vibrate  bypassing eardrum relaying sound directly inner ear  instead paying sounds ears  s something magical sound  difference presence  s like using speakers  sound somehow centred head  could immersive different way  many people prefer open backed headphones re cut environment around  s safer less antisocial  bone conduction headphones always hear s going around  want isolated  put earplugs  nt ram anything extra ears  pressure another band head  pretty lovely suffer headaches migraines  use headset day work meetings etc  m really dreading wear earbuds  m hoping mantis clip headphones work psvr2 float ears  nt touch head  hate difficult make putting headset taking get caught hair  going psvr audio time round 
nah  lack bass bone conductive headphones complete deal breaker gaming  able hear room  love aftershokz running  swimming etc  defo gaming  decent set enclosed ear wireless phones like arctis pro s way psvr imho 
bone conduction sucker bought toy store decades back  radio built could hear station closed teeth around sucker  called sound bites  later versions removed radio samples choose
reason ca nt use bone conducting headphones 35mm headphone jack  re bluetooth  get usb dongle 
bone conduction headphones even work properly 3d audio  3d audio uses information sounds propagate source ears  nt effectively skipping step sound propagation therefore reducing effect  trick  3d audio 
‚Äô try built ones also found update means get 3d audio bluetooth athm50x use avantree dg60 dongle  used option wired ones  ‚Äô try ‚Äô feeling ‚Äô going similar tried wired one psvr much stuff head ‚Äô pleasant  ‚Äô interested supposedly planned officially announced wireless ear buds good quality
m new vr using pulse headphones imagine sound alot better ones included bought bit whim preordeing ps5 barely use honest glad kept announced
way ve 12 years turtle beach px5 set still comfy still sound great let bluetooth extra input games playing wireless fall old still takes aa batteries get recharge batteries cycling charges faster flatten 
m glad let choose ps5 kira pros haptics headphones m hoping lnds well increasing immersion
‚Äô actually pretty smart suggestion  quite possible plastic frame etc picks vibration needed distorts sound 
set re pretty crap music  use podcasts  would nt think would sound great games
haha well s bloody random  appreciate hearing quirky history üòÜ
bluetooth going way much latency
nt 35mm jack  look bluetooth usb dongle thing  could great works  might great creative bone conduction headset still  titanium band goes round back head  nt know fit headset well 
nt know  s interesting question 
s really interesting  avantree update  playstation update  plug dongle ps5 
ones ve used cycling  sit low neck get way helmets
okay  looked curious  seems like work well  https  wwwtandfonlinecomdoiabs10108014992020600876519  journalcodeiija20  localization performance found nearly identical audio systems  indicating bone conduction systems effectively used displaying spatial information  though one advantage regular headphones would passively block outside sounds  play space quiet seems like difference 
i know time slowed crawl  ca nt still 7 days go  ü´† omg  fixed writing  carry 
well already bone conduction headphones connect ps5  could test nonvr game 3d audio compare regular headphones 
yeah think must update ps5  sure  plug usb console ‚Äô available audio output device  swap automatically well  think might setting somewhere
thank  finding  ll save reading study another day  s busy today  sounds promising  
guess 3d audio processing done ps5 instead breakout box  maybe options  s quite exciting prospect  really limited psvr1 
definitely  whole headphone cable pain first one way long  looked ridiculous
realised tempest audio 3d exist 
tried regular games  okayish  nt really blown away  end think s designed vr fact  makes sense audio important 360 degrees environnent 
think 3d audio previously processed breakout box psvr1 time around ps5 process  agree 3d audio flat games nt much either  seems conflict brain almost disconnect re seeing re hearing  never played rush blood psvr great 3d audio showcase creepy ghost kid singing nursery rhyme whilst materialising different points around room suddenly s right next whispering left ear causing turn immediately towards  away  shit pants 
love flatscreen games  decent set headphones  really elevate game  even games like gran turismo feel intense high speed using headphones  resident evil always better played headphones  vr  downright terrifying 
‚Äô absolutely mindblowing forbidden west  3d sound charts 
tv implementation ‚Äô great  works great headphones  means great vr 
yep  already worked excellent psvr1 games  one way test use free  vr worlds  shooting galery  demo  pick gun  hold hand holding gun different places around head shoot gun  better yet  close eyes let someone else place gun around head shoot  need guess sound coming  m telling s 100  accurate time  probably works good nt notice audio vr behaves real life  even though using 2  stereo  speakers 
3d sound makes noticeable difference flat games  s wellimplemented  especially combined good use haptics  odd time play without headphones feels like something missing  standouts  returnal  demon s souls  horizon fw  gt7  great 3d audio  definitely wellsuited vr though  already good psvr  looking forward trying psvr2 3d audio   new haptics 
re8 demo really showcase tempest audio think whole time thinking god gon na incredible get play vr  re8 ‚Äô confirmed vr time  
yeah personally  ‚Äô really make big difference flat games  ‚Äô hoping works lot better vr 
yeah spatialisation sound highly important really great immersion vr  yet often underestimated many players  manufacturers also blame two big ones offer mediocre headphonesspeakers headsets  psvr 12  quest 12  rift    s shame psvr 2 nt come proper  open back  speakers like rift cv1 valve index really take advantage 3d audio using external headphones  addition headset  brings lot friction 
let ‚Äô say throw grenade hear ticking explodes  without 3d spatial audio ‚Äô really tell grenade listening  could anywhere  3d spatial audio toss grenade hear ticking left side ‚Äô quieter get sense far away 
yeah  wonder ll like really hear 3d left right  also   everywhere  could life changer 
iirc ps5 basically audio processing chip vr1 breakout box built 
yes really noticed returnal demons souls  adds good subtle layer experience 
gon na shit
‚Äô huge difference forbidden west compared normal headphone audio  tlou part 1 well  ragnar√∂k disappointing though  games well 
left  right distance possible stereo already  front  back  binaural audio comes place 
well psvr 1 already processed 3d audio  one reasons breakout box  ‚Äô sure tempest higher quality definitely helps immersion 
tweak words idc  point remains 
audio output
hey everyone  anyone know possible audio come tv headset psvr2  girlfriend likes watch game would nice could hear audio wear headphones  sorry dumb question 
yes  girlfriend audio game coming tv  isolated 3d audio headphones  https  youtubeofovjubxj2g  t161 unless guy s headphones skull pulverizingly loud  hear tv audio output npc shouting  psvr1 
‚Äô awhile pretty sure option first model  first got family times watched everyone first experience pretty sure setup 
s example player listening game headset everyone else hear game s audio external speakers watching social screen   video   https  twittercomjurilogstatus1596772068280119296 
‚Äô know  currently  ‚Äô speakers headphones ps5  seems likely change psvr2 comes 
actually enjoyed playing psvr 1 without headphones using tv speakers  s much relaxed experience
could swear worked okay spacial audio translated surround sound ‚Äô put away 
awesome thanks 
‚Äô awesome ‚Äô case psvr 2 go party game 
feature ps vr 1 ps4 
would agree games like kayak vr mirage man ‚Äô sky  ‚Äô like fully immerse resident evil 8 thrills
lose 3d audio  nice vr  though 
rush blood ocean descent vr worlds  batman  arkham vr also fun one let people try 
psvr1 worked differently 3d sound processed breakout box  sent psvr  could listen unprocessed sound tv plus use wired headphones psvr  ‚Äô get 3d sound wireless headphones  yes  could get sound speakers wired headphones  psvr2  sound processing happens ps5  35 plugs controllers sense something plugged  use wired wireless headphones  right pick either headphones speakers  technical reason ‚Äô allow  vr games played people watching  would make sense add option 
use opposite  re7 tv sound keep pants clean  games headset immersion
tv speakers simulate surround sound  besides psvr 1 nt true 3d sound anyway stereo
oh yes ‚Äô vouch 3 great people new vr  simple controls less chance motion sickness  ‚Äô also say astrobot  sony needs psvr2 ports  ‚Äô play
s way sony give mute social screen  especially asymmetric multiplayer games  tv also sound  either mirroring s psvr2  potentially even  m sure psvr1 could even 
always use headphones  s always best feel body uncontrollably shit pants whilst put sound  peg nose works well extra 
tv speakers assume re always facing  nt work turn head  nt get 3d audio vr using tv speakers  psvr1 3d audio  s tempest 3d audiotech ps5 evolution  processed psvr processor box  also  3d audio delivered stereo headphones  psvr1 psvr2 
time playing cockpit sim facing forward anyway  ultrawingssquadronsace combatwipeout nt bother  would probably annoying game spin around bunch though
yeah  kind situation s really critical wear headphones  although d still like crane head around quite lot flight sim stuff 
psvr2  headphone audio output 
vr firsttimer great time psvr2  except ca nt figure get audio psvr2  turn psvr2  audio output comes monitor  nt see psvr2 option sound   output device  ve tried using different pair earbuds result  plug earbuds dualsense controller  get new output device option called  headset  controller    nt see psvr2  wondering whether m missing something whether psvr2 audio jack problem  could anyone confirm whether sound   output device option corresponding psvr2 supplied earbuds plugged psvr2 
seems like faulty 35mm jack  earbuds detected work connected dualsense  either send back replacement warranty  go wireless pulse 3d something similar 
weirdly  problem seems resolved  day two later psvr2 headphones suddenly started outputting sound option playstation vr headset appears sound   output device   game sound plays connected monitor psvr2 headset  monitor nt appear option sound   output device sound still sent  odd thing  nt anything make happen  started working normally  worry could mean loose contact somewhere headset  nt problems return process seems cumbersome  ll probably keep headset 
s headphone jack right next wire coming headset  behind head   plug 
pulse headset  use witelessly 
 ems like faulty 35mm jack  earbuds detected work connected dualsense  either send back replacement warranty  go wireless pulse 3d something similar  thanks reply  faulty 35mm jack suspect well  ll probably replacement  trying make sure nt miss something obvious 
thanks quick reply  already  plugged supplied headphones jack psvr2  also tried plugging different pair earbuds jack psvr2  either case get audio headphones option switch audio psvr2 sound   output devices  wondering whether option switch audio shows different menu somewhere
ve considering getting  better included earbuds  either way  think d want properly functioning psvr2 jack  case headset runs battery develops issue
still headphones plugged ps5 controller 
better earbuds  completely understand 
 ave headphones plugged ps5 controller  thanks reply  saw  problems without headphones plugged controller  weirdly  problem seems resolved  m adding note thread case s helpful someone

‚Äô know answer  played ton pistol whip tell ‚Äô issue  certain rhythm times  actions ‚Äô need correspond music  honestly could well music 
audio offset adjustment options game s menu ps5 see  likely headset come functional earbuds 
s 11 psvr2 tv screen fam blast handing get exhausted
noticed perfect sync headset headphones tv delay look sound sync watching  volume high tv hear music bit delayed coming speakers  seeing headset heating headset time
incorrect desire play scores  kind point  half formula score calculated based timing  scores nt concern shooting experience goal  sure  game  playable  even ca nt hear  s basically time crisis point 
thanks look  unfortunately hearing loss half volume normal person hear  making earbuds pulse 3d unsuitable  looks like one pass 
think misunderstood  concerned display delay vr headset tv  rather concerned audio outofsync due bluetooth delay  160ms case    nbsp  rhythm game audio sync unplayable  experienced drum rock option adjust audio delay settings  wondering pistol whip equivalent option 
s always chance could get patched later accessibility option  guess  setting uses headset vibration provide metronome  s chance throwing s sync music 
auto mute sound tvstereo system

mute tv
turn tv  unless guests watching  ‚Äô reason tv  fact light tv mess sensors psvr2 
‚Äô ‚Äô  annoying 
tv automatically turns ps5
disable settings  system  hdmi  hdmi device link 
like play flat ps5  seems like ‚Äô answer  closest thank 
psvr2 audio
hey guys  dont know exactly read included earbuds also provide 3d audio  true  thought would need headset like pulse similar 
stereo headphones 3d audio  main selling point pulse vr users wireless  fits vr headset 
pair earphonesheadphones provide 3d audio wired headset controller  pulse obviously work wired wireless 3d audio  might hit miss wireless brands  use wired ‚Äô always getting 3d audio 
stereo headphones give 3d audio depending headphones use  result wo nt  earbuds convenient  wo nt deliver best sound best spatialization  2 pairs headphones quite good  sony wh1000xm3  closed type  philips fidelio 2hx  openback type  spatialization sound different beetween two headsets  sony sound feels  tiny  spatialization good like enhanced stereo  philips feel immerse sounds seems  real  better spatialization  exactly tell sounds coming  
thx answer  think misconception 3d audio achieved  always stereo distinguish left right  audio sources behind  therefor would need headphones 71 sound  seems im wrong
well s also really good sounding headset  hurt ears bit though  bought ear epos hybrid gtw 270 really good üëç
would wireless headset hit miss 3d audio 
thx answer 
s old school physical 5171 due older surround headphones multiple drivers corresponding angles modern 3d audio uses software ever slightly alter sounds brain mistakes coming exact points around  whats cool old 5171 surround always ear level  modern 3d audio place sounds  well  fascinating stuff tbh 
well consider  probably  two ears  perceive audio coming 3d position  would need 2 speakers  reason used 71 etc  setups simplifies calculation terms much sound sent speaker give appearance surrounding sound  reason psvr1 breakout box mostly processing audio  s complex calculation  recently possible calculation real time  relates sound 3d space ear hear   read wikipedia   headrelated transfer function   https  enwikipediaorgwikiheadrelatedtransferfunction 
wireless dongle might send audio signal audio specs required 3d audio  100  want 3d audio using pulse headset  wired headset controller best way guarantee ‚Äô getting 3d audio 
indeed interesting  thank 
 reason used 71 etc  setups simplifies calculation terms much sound sent speaker give appearance surrounding sound  ‚Äô reason  3d audio 2 speakers works well place speakers persons ear  sound adjusted get correct sound ear  problematic ‚Äô wearing headphones  example ‚Äô watching movie multiple people  something like dolby atmos achieve experience larger space  multiple people experience time 
follow  s interesting audio finally got good  actually used really good back day  whole big old drama  interested always first video watch  read happened  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v7yc2podizgu
yeah wanted mention group experience stop procrastinating real work üòÇ imagine magic beamforming speakers could single speaker pair per person full 3d audio  tech nt yet gives little benefit current atmos setups cinemas 
honestly atmos ‚Äô really comparable ‚Äô sound 
external audio
apologies answered  remember using external audio  could hear ppl room  psvr 1 previously heads ppl wanting walk past really handy  option found psvr2  guess camera view 
‚Äô audio pass option  think ‚Äô general audio settings vr settings  ‚Äô tried ‚Äô know find exactly  give heads get home 
reason  got pistol whip bash later today  wifekids roll dice gamble walk past
like ambient sound game sound  might good patch later mic vr2 goggle  sell over ear  headphones allow abient sound filter  option  thinking thing  oem buds noise blocking 
‚Äô called ‚Äú sidetone volume ‚Äù general audio settings  play audio mic headset earphones hear ‚Äô going outside headset 
yes  thats  cheers
get audio headset tv playing psvr2 
preordered psvr2 ‚Äô previously owned vr  though ‚Äô tried couple   question audio tv ‚Äô playing   pulse 3d headphones use playing games moment using audio tv  ‚Äô seen people demoing psvr2 look use pulse headphones ‚Äô likely  someone room wants see see  gather shown screen ‚Äô much fun ‚Äô hear anything  know audio headset tv time  anyone psvr  1  know works 
psvr1 allows hear audio tv headphones time  social screen big factor headset  able psvr2  hope helps   
wonder right plug headset nt play tv
thing  turn psvr2 pulse 3d  headphones get audio everything happening psvr2 screen tv get none  start playing vr game  social screen tv get audio   technically speaking  yes  able get audio playing vr games  audio 2d content 
‚Äô confirmation sony far know  work  used wired headphone connected psvr2  wireless headphones use ps5 audio playing therefor eliminating possibility sound sources 
audio tv wearing psvr2 without headset  hides tv output audio  
get zero sound without headphones plugged tried everything  razer wireless ones work  wired ones headset work  nothing else  wanted audio buttkicker  haptics thing sim racing  could get gt7 going racing wheel haptics seat  even tried audio splitter headset  cut sound right nothing else  hope update fixes  settings option switch psvr2 headset audio  even headset unplugged 
great  thanks  use 3d pulse headphones psvr 
‚Äô speculation likely untrue 
would like know  well versed playstation  ca nt figure 
‚Äô seeing thing  absolutely horrible audio  psvr1 allowed audio sound system ps4 connected could fun together someone headset 
‚Äô  ‚Äô use wireless headphones psvr1 2  ‚Äô use pulse headphones wired think 
audio work use pulse headphones wirelessly  audio come tv speakers time   ‚Äô going change  yes  ‚Äô going change 
think figured  sound ps5 dashboard  however start game tv display turned bring back sound 
oh ‚Äô realise ‚Äô work wirelessly  assumed would  using wirelessly cuts audio output console puts headphones  via usb dongle  ‚Äô sure tv audio  ‚Äô gone back look video someone demo look like  wireless headset wired   https  ibbcox6jxybj 
‚Äô true psvr psvr2 sound calculated console 
using moment audio tv asking question  ‚Äô possible psvr connected option audio tv too‚Ä¶ ‚Äô know
‚Äô change  ‚Äô completely different use case  think sony engineers stupid forgot 
yeah actually forgot connect pulse headset 2nd session yesterday sound coming tv playing  really weird took moment realise sounded odd ‚Äô wearing headphones 
guy wrong  absolutely use wireless headsets psvr2‚Ä¶you though psvr1 
vr2 work wireless headphones vr1 could nt 3d sound processed breakout box vr2 done via ps5 may stop sound tv m sure
‚Äô sure  every single demo showcase wired headset  right  would great ‚Äô wrong edit  nevermind think ‚Äô right  awesome  
doubt wireless method going change  seeing ces demos using pulse wired  definitely audio coming tv 
messes audio works psvr2 connected ‚Äô going cause issue  sometimes ‚Äô need make changes sometimes bit code changing breaks much tries improve 
ah ok  ‚Äô different psvr1 answer question probably others‚Ä¶ ‚Äú ‚Äô know yet ‚Äù  guess ‚Äô wait see 
think also number people using psvr2 space meant wireless signals would working correctly  interference  sony decided give reviewers poor experience  guess though 
technical reason ‚Äô add option  ‚Äô know yet  ‚Äô  would significant oversight given effect could asynchronous vr games 
‚Äô really grasping straws 
‚Äô point making  ‚Äô using wired  happened tv audio 
correct  ‚Äô  without 3d blu ray function  simple porting ps4 blu ray code  possible sony choose implement two different things 
‚Äô one expecting audio output change  ‚Äô trying fill realistic expectation ‚Äô likely change  think ‚Äô easy expect change  mean 
sure  ‚Äô know yet feature  understanding 3d blu ray support pay licensing fee ‚Äô seen enough demand support paying  ‚Äô concern feature 
3d basically dead market tvs ‚Äô even produced anymore  ‚Äô logical decision remove ‚Äô used anymore 
ps5 psvr2 developed together start  honestly think sony engineers ‚Äô thought 
‚Äô still paying license fee ps4  remove feature ps4 ‚Äô think anyone uses ‚Äô want pay license fee  sony one inventors blu ray technology  ‚Äô pretty sure could wangle licence deal covers playstation hardware ‚Äô already ps3 ps4 
says ‚Äô used anyone  used  millions ps4 users moved ps5 working 3d tvs  need blu ray code different ps4  ‚Äô need revision feature already existed removed 
come laugh face 6 weeks time  delete comments suggested situation actually situation  ‚Äô really care either way  ‚Äô using wireless headphones anyway 
licensing bluray tech usually done one time  per device fee  sony could easily  ‚Äô likely cost something millions dollars  ‚Äô going convinced ‚Äô worth  sony moving away even including disk drive  could see going either way  maybe ‚Äô willing buy license ‚Äô optional disk drive purchasers  personally would rather spend money support promote 3d streaming  lot movies 3d versions never get physical release limited one hard expensive obtain  streaming distribution could economically viable format  imagine  example  disney plus added 3d streams movies released 3d versions 
looks 3d movies might make comeback  huge success avatar 2 seeing bunch stuff ces used stereoscopic 3d  canon brands vr headset stereoscopic 3d  asus new laptop 3d monitor  sony releasing detachable disc drive within year  might indicator sony add 3d bluray playback ps vr2  might hear later year things settled bit ps vr 2 release  took 5 months sony patch 3d blu ray playback simple firmware update original ps vr released ps4  hopefully long ps vr2 releases
one  miss ‚Äô reality 3d going  nowhere  sadly  agree removal hard understand though 
remindme  6 weeks
idea 3d content never came streaming  could maybe fast enough internet prevalent  time 4k taken hold 
state  ps5 psvr2 created together collaboration  day one ps5 knew watch 3d blu rays psvr would still want psvr2  many people still wanting asking feature psvr2   reason ps5 3d support ‚Äô even usable feature 6 weeks time  even tvs killed

sound tv headphones 
people saying could  posts saying nt play tv 
yes
‚Äô figure either  controllers working properly really disappointed far  ‚Äô get sound anything psvr2 headphone port  settings give options 
thank 
""
‚Äô doubting  definitely headphones  packed ones via 35mm jack   kids watching play pretty sure could hear separately   ‚Äô tv silent ears tv louder ‚Äô found volume   going back shortly  check real  ps4 headset dongle check want play  vs science   ‚Äô yet changed settings yeah ‚Äô doubting 
digital foundry guys said could audio go speakers  think ‚Äô possible  ‚Äô figured yet
oh really hope  would weird parties wife watching able hear anything 
3d audio
hey  first ‚Äô completely stoked getting psvr2 launch day  question simple  supplied ear buds support 3d audio  ‚Äô read many posts said regular ear buds headsets support 3d audio  make official pulse 3d headset really needed  ‚Äô case use supplied ear buds  pulse 3d set well pair sennheiser headphones  probably use earbuds simplicity ‚Äô sake  everyone else planning using 
stereo headphones support 3d audio
noise cancelling sony xm4
really liked earbuds came original psvr ll probably try  pick 3d pulse  50 week ago  could nt help  50
unless bundled earphones sound bad ‚Äô using convenience   actually look fairly substantial ian higton ‚Äô eurogamer unboxing close shot  much bigger sound chamber expecting  could sound pretty good  ‚Äô use pulse 3d headphones 
3d engine sound ps5 
use pulse 3d  provide much better sound wireless 
know sony nt include nicer headphone headset  sony wants sell pulse 
corsair virtuoso se
audio headphones earbuds 3d audio connect wire 35 minijack port head mounted display  psvr1 3d audio available using wireless headsets  however  ve seen multiple handson reviews tweet ian higton confirming 3d audio using wireless mode  know sure true sony 3d pulse headsets  since used handson sessions  others could working well confirmed yet  check  picture   https  mediadiscordappnetattachments10707404864547922631071186690795897013afbeeldingpng  width1169  height603  proof 
cabled guess  ve got xm3 s nt tend use gaming  probably really  d much better ones got free laptop 
get xm4 headphones work psvr2 
sure relative sound quality difference yet  included earphones pretty much ‚Äú wireless ‚Äù anyway  ‚Äô cable dangling ‚Äô already part headset  ‚Äô also quick put stow holders rummaging around pulse 3d making sure ‚Äô right way around  charged enough etc 
‚Äô also got xm3 ‚Äô makes even better ps5 ps4 ps5 built controls spatial sound lets adjust sound profile make headphones define mids highs bass  think xm3 ‚Äô default sound profile bit bass heavy drowns lower mids 
yeah re great plugged dualsense  headset hopefully able hold wire like earplugs
really  work nt tight fit uncomfortable imo  m probably going buy pulse headphones
mostly play beats amber things like  xm ‚Äô nice get sweaty 
surround sound üëç
wanted throw recommendation using headset surround speakers  works great head tracking box  generally prefer wearing headphones 
someone said works flat games post yesterday  settings  someone asking thread  thanks  surround sound usually preferred sound method
hoping find answer well  wanted try surround yesterday  options psvr2 wireless headset  arctis 7  sound settings 
someone wrong
unplug psvr2 headphones
 thought  although like immersive experience using headset buds  playing synth riders home theatre set blast  thanks lot 
record mic audio ps5 screen captures 
‚Äô great interactions pavlov recorded  mic audio never shows  setting include mic audio video captures 
yes  must enabled system settings
know specifically settings 
settings  captures broadcasts  captures  video clip format  include mic ‚Äô audio https  iimgurcomdbui4dwjpg toggled  video captures game sound turned slightly  voice clearly heard  also turn include party audio record party  selected let others record   psvr2 headset  3d pulse headphones  dualsense controller builtin microphones record voice 
hell yeah  thanks 
simultaneous sound via headphones tv 
lucky ones already got vr headset  possible output sound via headphones tv time  ve found far speculation weeksmonths ago 
yes ‚Äô default
posted question earlier tonight mine set  ‚Äô getting sound tv headset  get actual game sound come tv 
yes mine default 
yes default
default  slight delay picture sound coming tv compared s happening headset s normal 
issue drive crazy
yeah noticed delay playing drums rock  mute tv use headphones 
confirm 
perfect  thanks 
turn tv volume  headset volume stay 
yeah separate 
sick cuz getting echo
new vr  possible play headphones  sound coming tv 
play psvr1 games like ace combat vr2  going buy one next week want sure m stepping 
play without headphones 
‚Äô play psvr1 games psvr2 sound tv ‚Äô sure  checked tonight sound coming headset headphones maybe ‚Äô sound passthrough activated  used work ps1
think need psvr2 upgrades  job sim free upgrade  bunch psvr1 games ‚Äô able play ubtil make upgrade
sound come thru devices  otherwise moots point others able watch play  far playing psvr1 games   play games psvr2 games  psvr2 uses completely different tracking system headset controllers games require update psvr2 compatible  several games getting free updates  others paid  nt updated  game developers 
yes  expense immersion  wo nt get spacialisation sound ll lose good part presence produce vr  vr visuals  audio really important  
nice
hopr f1 vr2 
3d audio opinions
anyone use 3d audio currently gaming  mainly play fps games  overwatch apex  find 3d audio sounding like m soup  use turtle beaches 3d pulse headsets  wondering ll different vr m huge fan 3d audio currently 
headphones onboard processing  seems really weird would sound suggesting 
change sounds settings
‚Äô much fan flat 3d audio  worked good gt7  psvr1 3d audio sounded amazing though  think ‚Äô vr ‚Äô tracking actual head position ‚Äô much natural 
3d audio perfect fps games  love hearing bullet whizz behind left ear able determine m shot 
think pulse 3d sounds awesome   re comfortable  big ears  sound great imo 
‚Äô used pulse 2 years best audio experience ‚Äô ever gaming expensive headset job 
3d pulse headsets  s one official pulse 3d sony
use expensive solution 3d audio jvc  s headphones processor box connect earc use every source want  also supports atmos  compared pulse headset sonys 3d audio completely blows away jvc ext 1 stuff happens outside headphones room sound sources would real speakers  works really well  real downside s 1000 bucks debated long hard buying year ago glad  m playing dead space remake current game hearing sounds living room quite experience  course also hear enemies coming 
yeah ve tried bunch setting unfortunately
seems like lot games already built 3d audio distorts  maybe  m fan 
think sound really good well  3d audio enabled
 use turtle beach stealth 300 sony pulse 3d  think headsets sound great  3d tempest audio enabled
hmm maybe never actually enabled 
alright gotcha  developers btw  try sony 1st party titles notice right away great 3d audio sounds s fully used
nt tried sony game  maybe ll try spiderman something
way disable hdmi audio output  psvr2
still figuring psvr2  way disable hdmi audio output leave headphones like normal gaming 
mute tv 
turn volume receiver ‚Äô think time 
turn tv  unless someone room wants see ‚Äô seeing  might well turn ‚Äô pointless ‚Äô using vr 
spoiled auto mute 
yeah ‚Äô little annoying ‚Äô option somewhere find half time actually want audio imagine   annoying digging menus frequently versus muting 
headphones  3d audio psvr2
day decided bring ol psvr  s time  time purchased wireless headphones connects thr playstation  set psvr first time  ps5 asking   heh  buddy  s using headphones  bc youre using headphones long plugged system vr  plugged 3d audio  well shit  luckily headphones connected via 35mm  shuts power headphones longer able connect phones blutooth time  deal another wire  honestly think s bad coding please please please someone tell d go psvr2 
audio handled breakout box sent psvr headset  plug wired get 3d audio 
would use something liike  https  wwwbionikgamingcomcollectionsvraccessories
found answer another comment thread  https  wwwredditcomrpsvrcomments10bs0mhj8mr2ha
nah ‚Äô bull shit  sony ‚Äô flagship pulse headset wireless gets ‚Äú 3d audio ‚Äù  thing special 3d audio engine ‚Äô side  exports pure stereo sound 
see  s great chance wireless 
look neat  got stealseries 
psvr  psvr2 might ok sound processed console time  pulse headset works wirelessly  depends codec headphones use  ‚Äô bluetooth dongle  ‚Äô think ‚Äô getting 3d audio connection anyway ps5  ‚Äô 24ghz wireless dongle  might work 3d audio psvr2  would research specs works 
yes  thats exactly headphones  24ghz
thank input lol
audio  increase  decrease 
sony 3d headset released ps5  using psvr 2  playing cotm  noticed audio seemed locked could nt increase decrease sound  missing something  need adjust sound menu option game  ps  earphones plugged psvr 2 headset  using wireless dongle 
since ate using wireless dongle  ll use console menu  though  thought fine wireless dongle 
fit okay top  ‚Äô try mine  comfortable 
guess use dongle  concerned charging  controllers need charging b4 headset anyway  right  wo nt matter 
fit great  comfy 
yeah  controllers need charged anyway 
sweet  look forward using
sound system instead headphones 
way get psvr2 games play sound system instead headphones  even  unplug headphones go audio options ps5 thing psvr2 ‚Äô turned 
found work around  similar get sense controllers work  unplug psvr2  start game want play  unplug headphones psvr2  plug turn psvr2  stays system sound 
press ps button go sound settings bar pops press x top option let change speakers headphones  s speakers directly plugged console  nt figured time without amp 
sound play tv headphones 
‚Äô tried  psvr2 normal sound option  gives psvr2 headphones option  way change 
nt figured yet  workaround allowed able switch sound headphones tv system could listen game instead playing  ve figured one far 
mine used let switch recent update ca nt  know month old updates  
hardware defective  plastic sound turning head rightleft
hello  received psvr2 headset  makes  plastic moving sound  turning head  basically nocited whole part goes head well fixed headset  moves slightly sides  intended  completely ruins  
probably headset tight straining headband  loosen little  probably also wearing incorrectly 
m sure bit mean moving slightly head band front made flex  sections cut flex bit  sort like slice melon perpendicular cuts 
might head  robot 
tried everything cant get rid sound  seems defective  well screwed junction main part part head  m send back ask refund cause dont want use 
mean part going head attached main part  moving black part going inside headset  moving side  move head rightleft left right  makes plastic sound even hear earplug ears  dont even move fast  feel right 
m  really think headset issue  like screwed correctly something  plastic sound normal 
drums rock sound quality
drums rock tracks shitty bitrate  better others   bring life  sounds like absolute garbage  used buildin psvr2 headset switched arctis 7p hoping better   bring life  even worse lol  love game wheezy basses bad overall sound making think something wrong hardware 
 deleted 
nt songs covers 
yes  cover sucks indeed  m talking sound  compression   quality  s like using 64 kbps mp3 crappy headphones 
sony xm4 headphones 360 audio work psvr2 
pair sony wh1000xm4 headphones uses 360 reality audio   360 audio work ps5 s tempest engine psvr2 
 unnecessary  psvr2 needs stereo headphones produce 3d audio  wh1000xm4 s work fine  plug headphone jack headset 
pair cans give 3d plug jack port worth nothing pair wirelesss cans work thru dongle also give 3d audio 
unfortunately xm4s ‚Äô well headset  would love noise canceling  360 audio works certain apps super lame 
true headphones surround option needs turned 3d audio work
relay room audio headset 
somewhere ‚Äô sure ‚Äô read switch ‚Äò room audio ‚Äô picks sound surroundings relays back headphones  ‚Äô find setting read either  although totally immersive experience amazing  village already spooking hell  getting tap shoulder real life without warning also make jump skin  üòÅ ‚Äô like awareness someone enters room still hear noises world  make setting  something

holy shit ve got coming 11 days  clock  wow
tempest 3d audio works stereo headphones  pulse 
must honest  almost could nt believe really try  last moment  something magic  believe really try  nice 
issues audio output
small external dac ‚Äô using ages ps5  usb connected  want plug headphones instead vr might get better sound higher volume  however  select dac audio output using vr2  audio comes tv  anyone similar issue  really ‚Äô want stuck vr2 audio  ‚Äô low volume
nt give tinnitus  feel regular headphones volume  low  already damaging hearing
headphones  ‚Äô found ps5 controller  7hz timeless  hd800s  akg 612702  hd 560s  250ohm d770  arias  halos  katos  iems obviously get loud  cans got loud enough ‚Äô hear people well even open backs  said option ‚Äô get work battery powered amp
mean depends hard headphones drive  tons headphones would really quiet ps5 controller 
hd560s plugged small sound blaster dacamp  dac nothing special gets job done  importantly  audio clean  ‚Äô playing village hour plugging head phones vr  aside low volume  could already notice background noise bugging 
‚Äô sound blaster g6 thing drives stuff well  eq console nice  also dude ‚Äô review sites measure everything write like 8 page detailed reports sound blaster stuff measures low distortion fine  ‚Äô used hd560s got plenty loud  check game sound settings  akg 702 harder drive still get loud enough  bit quieter ‚Äô want hmm  iems truthear halos 20 bucks sound like nearly 100 bucks  get loud enough 40  ya battery amp 
surround sound without headphones 
saw hands said headphones   required   vr2  set pulse 3d s  word s absolutely true  maybe demohow audio set  ll definitely use headphones playing alone could see wanting use surround sound able still talk user friends playing 
several reasons makes little sense use headphones logical  tv stereo speakers get stereo recompiled signal ‚Äô turn head  ‚Äô 3d sound also ‚Äô even correct stereo sound ears turn head move around room  additionally likely slight lag  least ‚Äô psvr  want hear environment recommend pair open back headphones 
still use receiver receives stereo signal processing put 51 71 true surround like get non vr games blu rays thats psvr 1  guessing ll 2 nt seen info
ever get answer op  ‚Äô got psvr2 trying work hear 71 receiver  rather included earbuds 
ah true nt think look sound adjusting  guess turn headphone volume  thanks
true  psvr ‚Äô use due considerable lag compared headset audiovideo  social screen always like half second late due necessary recompiling flat picture  surround sound ‚Äô work  would 
yep  works fine lol 51 m sure sound completely accurate nt noticed otherwise  definitely works fine everything ve tried 
know problem‚Ä¶i tend put half way ears  debating get pair open back headphones  even think earbuds still leave sound 
receivers take stereo signal mix 51  nt completely accurate course
thanks  ‚Äô give go  ‚Äô still ‚Äú set properly  ‚Äù stage little confused  hence checking reddit instead diving  
connection vr though 
jealous  re treat  mine since launch s still amazing every time put 
play plenty psvr games always facing forward like beat saber
play music game ‚Äô even realise half second delay  ‚Äô wild ü§£
s audio offset setting
 especially friends play  delay nt much issue   play normal  maybe expert would make huge difference ü§î 
‚Äô absolutely works case  ‚Äô completely different thing  ‚Äô cheat time delay ‚Äô caused signal paths necessity conversion time 
s audio offset setting adjust ever notice
psvr2 headphones  sound
‚Äô hear anything included headphones  anyone ideas  setting missed 
issue changing audio output ‚Äô work  options steelseries headset sound bar  ‚Äô find way add another sound option steelseries set sound  vr2 still ‚Äô audio  tried reconnecting outlets  anyone suggestions missed wrong

nt wireless headphones connected  old pair ps4  dongle nt plugged ps5 since never use  s strictly tv speaker sound bar issue m  something psvr even plugged ps5 removing sound except plugged headphones 
sound output work 
ive never vr  noob question  use vr  tv acts secondary display  plug earphones tv also output game sound  update psvr faq  ‚Äú audio image displayed vr headset output tv side wearing vr headset playing cinematic mode ‚Äù additional info  ‚Äú ps vr2 games designed ps vr2 require headset  noted title ps vr2 required  also titles ps5 console may include vr mode within console version game  noted ps vr2 compatible  experience vr mode  headset required  ‚Äù
tv output game sound ll missing 3d sound  required games games hearing far something really helps boxing play sound tv  games help determine enemies games give rough idea virtual haircut  probably sounds better 3d headphones earbuds still works https  youtubeiudtlvagjja ll listen 3d headphones see better mist 3d audio book  https  youtubeyt3shc5al8g
right  option output sound headphones tv ps5  likely change psvr2 comes  wait see 
thanks
using psvr comes  maybe 
s wrong  like psvr1  psvr2 output earphones social screen simultaneously  seen number previews  like one   https  twittercomjurilogstatus1596772068280119296  
‚Äô wrong though  think misunderstood op talking specifically vr  use headphones nonvr game  sound comes headphones  psvr1 titles comes  ‚Äô safe assume come psvr2  ‚Äô sure 3d audio works process intensive  ‚Äô make bets yet unless ‚Äô officially confirmed 
uh  ‚Äô said  ‚Äô currently  probably psvr2 comes  psvr audio entirely different way  audio processing happened breakout box sent separately tv headset   worked  psvr2  audio processing happens console   ‚Äô software update enable option allow simultaneous output speakers headphones  option  ‚Äô use speakers headphones whether wireless wired plugged controllers  reason think ‚Äô roll option everyone psvr2 comes 
literally first sentence op wrote  well entire subreddit  asking audio vr  s correcting  waiting psvr2 system update vr mode  s wrong  literally linked gamer listening horizon com headphones game s audio simultaneously output external speakers  psvr2 demo videos show thing  re assuming update would allow dual output nonvr use  s part s speculative 
1 video  ‚Äô actually know sound coming headphones  ‚Äô wearing headphones  could switched outputs video  2 ‚Äô know console software used demos  might already dual output option patched  3 video guy using wired headphones  psvr2 also supports wireless headphones  psvr1   going need software update additional output options work even wired ones  4 could enable dual output psvr2  would still require output setting change  bottom line  able output headphones speakers psvr2  almost certainly yes  require sony change output settings  also yes 
kind bizarre  never wan na wrong internet  response  really believe guy video clip would wear headphones audio coming external speakers  ca nt believe nonsense   another example audio going headphones external speakers simultaneously  https  myoutubecomwatch  t161  vofovjubxj2g  featureyoutube  audio output two devices  host video put headphones guest player even though nt work theory  bwahahaha   real bottom line  op asked could listen games playing psvr2 audio simultaneously comes external speakers  simple answer  see two clips posted  many internet   yes  nothing needs said 
psvr2 tv audio output
hi guys  trying play sound tv wearing psvr2 headset  default seems hidden  use headphones  open audio output settings tv audio output visible  suggestions solve  ps5 audio headset  would prefer use tv audio output 
think figured  looks  open base ps5 dashboard seem sound  maybe tv seems disabled moment  however start game tv comes  displays game sound back  
noticed  makes previous comment irrelevant  odd issue 
absolutely working  game  video anything except inside psvr2 headset sound  soon take headset sound video comes tv 
cinematic mode  sound output options
feel blessed  amazing experience far psvr2  slight day one hiccup controller buttons  recharge minor fixes working flawlessly since  m blur issues  sweet spot easy find consistent  one primary reasons purchase cinematic mode  m quite cinefile decent theater setup  including high end audio system full subs surround  playing games  horizon   etc video plays screen around beautiful sound system  immersive  contrary  cinematic mode  option headphones  ca nt select external audio  s video output change move screen  would work   cinematic  s headphones  missing something   would love deep  immersive sound watching movies 
ah  problem  sounds like easy fix sony 
s works unfortunately  really stupid move sony  psvr1 thing cinema mode  least sound sitting main menu  nt know re  let us use home theater everything  also keep mind surround sound properly supported games source sound keeps shifting around turning head  turn body virtually break surround  proper support home cinema surround supported psvr1 games hoped would system level psvr2  sadly  s still half assed force headphones onto 
really sucks ca nt stand feeling earbuds ears  makes feel like ears full water drives insane 
sony hta9  tried connect sound system dongle via bluetooth cinematic mode  apparently sound system ‚Äô recognize connected usb  worked bluetooth earbuds 
audio stops playing switching youtube flat game
hope somebody tell makes sense buggy behaviour taking place  play psvr2 game  sound playing tv fine  switch flat game  youtube even spotify  sounds stops playing option audio settings showing psvr2 headphones  nothing plugged audio port psvr  happening  thanks advance insights 
m starting worry m one issue ü§î
found go vr game leave game go home screen  tv displaying anything sound well  ‚Äô know ‚Äô thing experiencing ‚Äô know correct 
yeah happens sometimes well  nt find pattern yet though 
anyway sound go external speakers  sitting racing rig 
""
try  right hdmi monitor 35mm output  would rather plug headset directly 
‚Äô tried could potentially use audio jack headset connect speakers  instead headphones 
sound coming surround sound sure
sound comes tv well headset vr mode  either use tv speakers connect tv surround system 
issue plugging directly would slight sound delay  although racing game ca nt see major problem 
mistake bad connection
bluetooth headphone adapter 3d audio 
helloooo everyone  ‚Äô got pair sony xb900n ‚Äô  problem ‚Äô use dongle connect ps5 means 3d audio  problem plugging  people prefer ‚Äô get tangled  anyone know bluetooth transmitteradapter works purpose 
ive used works fine support 3d audio  ‚Äô personally noticed audio delay  avantree dg80 bluetooth 50 usb audio adapter ps4 ps5 windows mac linux pc computer  driver installation required  aptx low latency dongle music  calls  works headset  speakers https  amzneudfyymnp9
35mm jack bluetooth transmitters  would need plugged headset anyway  something go flat  add weight  importantly add lot latency might make feel funky 
3d audio bluetooth  bluetooth ‚Äô handle  need headphones use 24ghz wireless dongle  usually called usb wireless   headphones plug  going plug headphones want use 
‚Äô exactly looking  thanks much 
yep  use one s great  good microphone audio mind  issue since nt use mic   sounds great 3d audio sennheiser headphones 
prolly dumb question  mean hook sony 1000xm2 cord controller  s 3d audio 
beg differ  use  avantree dg80  bt dongle 2 different sennheiser headphones  get 3d audio  adjust 3d audio settings headphones connected  using headsets cord sounds m connected bt  said  s likely bluetooth headphones get 3d sound dongle  apparently headphones spacial  3d effect ca nt work 3d audio 
thanks 
 make sure ‚Äô ps5 settings 
interesting  looks like found way trick ps5 thinking bluetooth dongle  sony generally ‚Äô allow bluetooth bandwidth latency ‚Äô sufficient high quality experience  experience like  edit apparently presents usb sound card 
good find  ordered  plug bluetooth headset using 35mm makes kind audio feedback  bypass 
yeah  could case  also interesting  dongle shows  audio output  dropdown menu s connected  seems like s properly detected ps5  m sensitive audio latency  s problem bt dongle  since uses aptx low latency  headphones  terms overall  quality   ca nt notice difference using headphones wired wireless  though m sure true audiophiles could notice difference  think way  plug wired headphones controller  uses bluetooth  right  possible get 3d audio external dongle 
think console remote might use bluetooth protocols communicate  know connect controller bluetooth device  35mm jack ‚Äô work  think bluetooth set pretty limiting protocols use 24ghz wireless  audio ‚Äô sent console remote using bluetooth protocols  could higher quality lower latency  ‚Äô know actually  though 
getting sound left side
started playing around headset  great m getting sound left ear  quick googling showed seems issue psvr 1 well  anyone else  real bummer got
checked 35mm audio jack pushed way   would cause sound 1 ear  could try unplugging  blowing  plugging back
try headphones 35mm jack
happened nt pushed way even though might seem like 
omg lmao thank
tried  along another headaet  sadly change üò™
hmm  could case faulty internal connection audio jack  might need open report sony  meantime guess could use wireless headset ps5 dongle like sony pulse  may able get audio ps5 controller 3 5mm jack nt know enabled running psvr2
bad idea would play audio tv speakers psvr2 
even option  use pair headphonesearbuds sort  m asking really nt like use headphones  avoid using d prefer  even experience little less immersive 
psvr2 ear bud clips side position toward head make little speakers headset  solution costs audio quality wo nt sound good something right ears  would give proper spacial audio without wear anything extra  highly recommend using tv lose big immersion element s s 
think s pretty bad idea  re headspace center aural field  defeat part point virtual reality  get over theear speakers  like bionik mantis
bad imo   vr immersion  sound coming tv would ruin  whatever want 
must use headphones‚Ä¶ however‚Ä¶ even though audio quality ‚Äô good  use external clipons mantis convenient hell  padding bothered ears  covered microfiber cloth  helped lot  ‚Äô come use multiplayer shooters creative apps flipped ears  works fine ‚Äî audiophile quality  fine  ‚Äô want something ears ‚Äô picky  expect clipons  something similar  might work well  less gross share compared earbuds  ‚Äô sure 
bad idea  headphones speakers headset must  tv ca nt simulate turning head sides 
could winning game heavily depends hearing location game objects  ll disadvantage  could try aftershokz headphones d also need bluetooth dongle  work ok may work 100 percent games  miss entire 3d effect virtual barber shop https  youtubeiudtlvagjja
reason use headphones purpose playing horror games  reduced immersion really helps case  beat saber also ok nt change orientation  latter important  eg  astrobot  little robots shout help easily localize 
horrible 
nice party games  player wants connection  audience   played beat saber like example  remove lot emersion  know people scared shitlles playing  played tv audio 
immersion s pretty terrible  said  kids running around also psvr mainly used people  beatsaber   headphones get rarely  ever used psvr1 think 2 unless kids bed looking completely get lost game 
tv supports 3d audio nt think anyone would crucify forgo headphones  answer question play tv
ll obviously lose 3d audio re bothered games still playable using tv speakers 
horrible idea
ears big hurts earbuds ordered ear epos hybrid  hope good 
psvr1 audio came tv well ear buds  assume psvr2
understandable question  m fan gaming earbuds even full ear gaming headphones longer sessions  unfortunately psvr setup centered ht space 71 setup ideal  solution lightweight set onear headphones 35mm input jack short 12  patch cable  nt get itchy like earbuds hot like full ear headphones actually make less immersive  light weight bit loose barely know sounds quality excellent short patch cable extra wires hanging around 
sounds like comments agreement mantis clipon speaker solution best bet  even know bionik mantis clipons fit onto psvr2 
way 
true  3d audio tv different 3d audio headset  turn head left  tv sound still come place  headphones speakers headset must 
extremely incorrect
nt know certain  looking shape band similar psvr  m fairly confident  pair psvr  check fit psvr2
im saying s fine listen tv  yall acting re mad someone nt like wearing headphones
said incorrect  https  wwwplaystationcomenussupporthardware3daudiops5  tv
agree
get sound come speakers 
ps5 settings audio allow psvr2 headphones  üòê
need driving rig buttkicker  would happy two speakers 
nt  use 35mm jack headset pulse 3d headset sony 
reviews stated could use surround sound system audio positional  psvr 1 
black screen sound  image trying play cosmonious high demo  ‚Äô wrong  psvr2
set headset head first game try even appear wear  mess something broken  try game  loaded one get quick experience  edit  restarted console began work
try plugging ps5 wall ig
couple times today  trying show friend horizon  headset saying black nothing around   happened started village  note  nt yet installed vr component thought update downloaded day included     x200b  exiting game using ps button restarting game fixed

psvr 2 making buzzing sound
hi guys first psvr owner loving thing   problem  headset makes buzzing sound ‚Äô like loud anything like ‚Äô something bothers little  overthinking ‚Äô natural something wrong  headset works fantastic nothing wrong btw sound 
think s fan put headset 
‚Äô haptics 
oh okay  makes sense thank 
everything silent hear fan working  little big sound masks though 
2 audio streams playing time 
realise shows much noob  og psvr never used headphones relied 51 system  probably means never actually experienced directional audio  know  reason nt almost always played partner  taking turns using headset  s cool person playing hear everything well see social screen  question  play wearing headphones  another person watching social screen   listening ingame audio time 
yes  someone tested psvr2 pulse headset sony event recently confirmed plays audio headphones tv  nt remember think channel people seemed know trusted 
actually psvr games took advantage 51 71 system audio directional  played paper beast audio directional 71 system  couple games  perhaps better psvr2  prefer 71 system headphones sounds natural  never liked 3d audio psvr1  nt put additional weight head 
sure 
play tv ‚Äô sound psvr2 
""
yes  ‚Äô fan style earphones comes ‚Äô plug sound come normal method 
come tv  never plugged shows ‚Äô connected unless turn actual headset
yes  mine also shows connected 
‚Äú ambient mode ‚Äù skullcandy crusher evo absolute top sound immersion ‚Äô ever going get vr  maybe old news‚Ä¶  sorry 
""
 s skullcandy üò≠
ignorant  dont mean condescending way used think exactly way  heard headphones  ive beats  ve listened bose  razer logitech pc headphones  sennheiser headphones  deliver absolute best bass sound quality ve ever experienced  s obscene skullcandy right good 
headsets work playstation ‚Äô 3d audio 
currently razer nari ultimate using past two years  sounds great pc pcvr  although ‚Äô unsure compares playstations 3d audio  71 virtual surround sound although read playstations 3d audio work channels like pc  ask preordered psvr2 ‚Äô ability test first headphones  ‚Äô unsure ‚Äô compatible  help regarding headset work well audio  andor upgrade would good one would recommend  want keep nari ultimate integrated rumble headset  add immersion  although  ‚Äô work playstations 3d audio  ‚Äô rather better sound rumble  edit  put man war instead nari ultimate  man war old headset  thanks 
stereo headphones 3d audio ps5 
first  game support  implement 3d audio even matter  aaa titles    stereo headsets support 3d audio natively could use free wired ear buds got old galaxy phone  poof  instant 3d audio   arctis 7p  support 3d audio  also atmos surround setup well  sweet spot get full advantage  awesome still  ideal vr  said  headset dongle ll likely support 3d audio since natively processed ps5 game implements 
arctis models  pro  also sony pulse thanks custom eq support ps5 better sounding 
stereo headphones use 3d audio  question one best 
use razer thresher seems work well 
 10 amazon earbuds actually better high end ones tried 
nice  would play manowar playing  fall   made feel like conan barbarian  picked pulse 3d vr feel good vr sound except  blood  truth   noises front behind vice verse  s like 3d audio s flipped 
technically true ‚Äô cheap headset bad frequency response ‚Äô gon na work well 
""
something keep mind  make customized sound profile equalizer menu ps5  need pulse 3d  s headphones fully compatible ps5  maybe able access new earbuds ps vr2 hav nt heard anything yet  matters much since default sound profiles choose anyways  using headphones need customize settings 3rd party app pc phone need also choose default options already sounds great get go  even brands sony headphones ca nt access custom equalizer menu 
would add vr games support 3d audio   anyone name one ‚Äô   ‚Äô sort point vr everything  audio included  happens 3d 
‚Äô considering pulse  psvr2  seems like would convenient  like ‚Äô troubleshoot much sony tested products ‚Äô less designed playstation products  plus relatively affordable 
cheap headphones going sound bad matter feed 
‚Äô think run troubleshooting much fit issues  headphones ‚Äô fit well psvr1 likely psvr2 ‚Äô strap  use pulse3ds psvr1 order use discord vr games work fine  though obviously wired since psvr1 ‚Äô support wireless headphones   replace ear pads breathable material shortly getting  sounds like ‚Äô used headphones pcvr may bother  ‚Äô planning stop using pulse3ds vr soon discord supported ps5 ear headphones  vr sweaty  ‚Äô using either rebuff reality vr ears fit koss ksc75 psvr2 
pulse use psvr 1 fit well use also clamp psvr headband lay pulse headband rest headset quite effectively  makes sense 
sure stereo image dependent great frequency response  3d binaural sound absolutely hrtfs ‚Äô work well highs mushy example  source  audio engineer 
choose tv audio output watching netflix 
‚Äô seem find way use psvr2 without headphones  tips 
sure settings  headphones came psvr 2 plugged selected default outputs tv headset m confident re somewhere  opposite issue  fix easier mute home theater system  nt get answer m near set ll try help find setting 
ca nt  cinema mode forces headphones  true psvr1  improvement regard 
change audio output psvr2
headphones plugged unit go system menus get audio going audio settings system shows audio output set  headphones connected psvr2  option change  play games goes surround sound odd nt see problem online anywhere else  encounter  fixes 
reading around think m talking cinema mode content apparently nt allow audio unless earbuds  bizarre 
audio tv psvr 2 cinema mode
design bug  used old psvr sometimes watch movies etc  play nonvr games cinema mode audio fine  tried play nonvr games vr 2 audio ‚Äô plug headphones  kinda disappointing‚Ä¶

3d audio headset 
im guessing 3d audio nt software thing headsets  headset 3d audio bluetooth  dongle hook ps5  buy dongle works headsets  work fine  possible get 3d audio like  inear headset 3d audio 
pretty much wired stereo headphonesheadset plug controller  presumably psvr2  work 3d audio  ‚Äô need made 3d audio  wireless headsets tricker research model consider separately  steelseries arctis 7p example support 3d audio  others  especially surround sound features   case case basis  wired earbuds work  due design ‚Äô get full experience ear headphones  wireless ones probably limitations wireless headsetsheadphones 
wired headset support 3d audio  usb wireless headset  bluetooth wireless headsets 
possible bluetooth headset comes without dongle  buy usb dongle  put ps5 works together 3d audio 
really  well think bluetooth also works made ps5 3d audio  look pulse 3d wireless headset bluetooth made ps5 supports 3d audio  every wired headset works 3d audio bluetooth headset supports 3d audio specially made 3d audio
understanding  bluetooth dongle work 
pulse 3d ‚Äô bluetooth  uses 24ghz connection  kind connection different bluetooth often referred usb wireless generally requires usb dongle work  ‚Äô usually built things like bluetooth  24 ghz connection allows higher bandwidth lower latency bluetooth 
pulse headset bluetooth dongle nt 
 pulse 3d ‚Äô use bluetooth  uses 24ghz wireless signal  commonly referred usb wireless  ‚Äô different kind signal bandwidth less latency 
pulse3d wireless  psvr2  tv audio hdmi streaming capture 
right ps5 ca nt use pulse3d connected via bluetooth via dongle audio hdmi simultaneously going tv elgato hd60x capture box  limitation pulse3d psvr2 opened capability simultaneous audio hdmi pulse3d using psvr2  know use wired headphones come psvr2 still get audio video tv friends watch play  pulse3d wirelessly hooked still possible allow game capture  psvr2 arrived home ca nt wait try stuck work need answers lol 
ve playing pulse headphones via dongle back ps5  confirm  audio automatically also comes tv like normal people viewing
thanks  hoping

steelseries arctis 7p  imho one comfiest headsets ever tried   ‚Äô maybe perfect  earpieces quite big  fits psvr2  prefer included inear buds

get bluetooth dongle use headphones   even 3d audio headset provides bluetooth dongle 
bluetooth sucks standard audio profiles nt task gaming  s fine listening music  s high latency  running fullduplex mode headphones microphone input quality drops significantly  may better profiles way  last looked standard terrible highquality lowlatency audio  s ve roll solution  gaming laptop latest bluetooth standard  using bose nc700 s significant delay  critical games  unplayable music ones  nintendo switch also lets connect bluetooth audio  delay using airpods pro significant  using pulse 3d imperceptible  vr 3d audio especially  significant bluetooth delay could cause nausea potentially

possible delay audio bluetooth headphones
would great oculus audio delay slider
bluetooth headsets delay  see soundcore razer vr earbuds latenzy 
nt think s possible use bluetooth delay games way movies  movie  actually advancing audio compensate delay inherent bluetooth connections  ca nt something changes dynamically like game audio 
hey  meta always looking ways make device better enjoyable customers  suggestions always heard  would love went  ideas forum   https  communityforumsatmetacomt5ideasidbpideas  page posted feedback  never know  idea could one might see future updates  ca nt wait see amazing ideas customers device 
well like app delays bluetooth headsets 
would possible  device generates audio  waits bit send headset 
""
come bluetooth hardware 
surely idea normally remove delay  extend 
oh well s shame
title suggested otherwise 
sometimes read lines  üòÅ
s meant tho  delaying audio game catch vice versa
s trouble  bluetooth introduces unavoidable audio delay audio already playing video  way sync two would delay video well wants half second   latency game  s problem wtaching something uninteractive like movie pull trigger gun fires makes bang second later  nt going satisfied 
problem re rushing  re dragging audio behind image delay caused sending audio bluetooth  add delay  necessity impact image  delaying sync audio  flat screen would bad vr would unbearable  imagine turning head  half second later vision moves

another advantage android 12 according twitter user   big one would wireless adb enabled without computer  meaning use adb quest without connecting computer every reboot   understand correctly  means change settings via sidequest  like rendering resolution level fixed foveated rendering quest uses  settings stay permanent wo nt reset rebooting    source    https  twittercombasti564status1640413175899144201

superlux hd668b  los auriculares que engancharon en el audio
buenos d√≠as  muchas gracias por todos sus comentarios buen recibimiento en mi √∫ltima rese√±a acerca de los buds2  hoy les traigo la rese√±a que siempre tuve ganas de hacer desde que empec√© escribir acerca del audio  mis primeros auriculares en serio  los superlux hd668b https  previewredditeaxi07bt3fya1jpg  width2415  formatpjpg  autowebp  venabled  s353eea6ff3756f941b6a74119e8a3a310945d9d1  introducci√≥n los superlux hd 668b fueron mis primeros auriculares luego de haber usado por a√±os auriculares ‚Äú gamer ‚Äù  siempre quise adentrarme en el mundo del audio como mi presupuesto era limitado este era el mejor auricular ear que pod√≠a pagar en ese momento  2020    x200b     pros      contras         gran relaci√≥n precio calidadagudos punzantes sibilantes resoluci√≥n  separaci√≥n e imagen que compite con auriculares de mayor rango de precioconstrucci√≥n enteramente en pl√°stico graves con buena presencia  punch  controlalmohadillas poco profundas voces e instrumentos tienen un timbre natural  primeras impresiones antes de comprarme este par de auriculares ten√≠a unos steelseries arctis 3 ambos auriculares presentan una respuesta en frecuencia en forma de v donde se acent√∫an los graves agudos  sin embargo  cuando cambi√© los steelseries por los superlux not√© al instante que el sonido se ‚Äú destap√≥ ‚Äù  esto es porque en los arctis 3 las frecuencias medias est√°n tan perdidas por debajo del resto de las frecuencias que hac√≠an que cualquier voz instrumento que se encuentre en este rango suene carente de cuerpo  lamentablemente ya hace varios a√±os atr√°s vend√≠ los steelseries por lo que puedo hacer una comparaci√≥n directa  pero cr√©anme que el salto fue una verdadera barbaridad   unboxing  construcci√≥n confort por  35 usd   20000 ars  la experiencia de unboxing es muy buena  los auriculares se encuentran en una caja de cart√≥n decente vienen con una buena variedad de accesorios  un cable de 1 metro otro de 3 metros  un adaptador de 35mm 635mm una funda para transportar  https  previewredditxg4sxcm74fya1jpg  width2981  formatpjpg  autowebp  venabled  sbb956abea469d63f937a09ec5a74e9bff23baeda https  previewredditnzmic8q44fya1jpg

s388469d94e0516f518d10c846e5917a8db01e785 la construcci√≥n se basa principalmente en pl√°stico excepto en la diadema que es de metal  pesar de esto  son unos auriculares que se sienten s√≥lidos van romperse por unas ca√≠das al piso  tambi√©n  esta cantidad de pl√°stico hace que sean unos auriculares extremadamente livianos  lo cual es un plus si se requiere usarlos por varias horas  claramente esta construcci√≥n es similar la de varios modelos de la marca akg la diadema se asemeja mucho la del reconocido r70x de audio technica  las almohadillas de las copas de la diadema son de cuero sint√©tico  algo particular que tienen los 668b es que poseen un conector 35mm que cuelga de la copa izquierda para conectar el cable de los auriculares  mucha gente menciona que esto es un claro punto d√©bil de la construcci√≥n puede romperse en cualquier momento  en mis 45 a√±os de uso  continuo pero habitual  han sufrido ning√∫n tipo de problema en esta zona pero pareci√≥ bueno mencionarlo para que sea tenido en cuenta  en cuanto confort  este es el peor aspecto de estos auriculares  si sos una persona que est√° acostumbrada que las copas de los auriculares aprieten en lo absoluto ‚Äú floten ‚Äù en tu cabeza te va ir muy mal con este par  una buena noticia es que despu√©s de dos semanas de uso de dejarlos descansar con su diadema abierta en alguna caja soporte esta presi√≥n afloja bastante  https  previewredditdwx3ftzc4fya1jpg  width3000  formatpjpg  autowebp  venabled  sc368129d6556294999d357c77d7862ae93854c94 las almohadillas tambi√©n son un punto problem√°tico de estos auriculares  son muy poco profundas por lo que es muy probable que las orejas toquen la tela que cubre el driver  sin embargo  seg√∫n lo que busqu√©  pero prob√© a√∫n   las almohadillas compatibles con los akg k240 pueden caber en las copas del 668b  aliviando el disconfort que puede causar el cuero sint√©tico la poca profundidad de las almohadillas stock   descripci√≥n de la respuesta en

pero que suena bien balanceada  los graves se entrometen en otras frecuencias   graves elevados pero con buen control  lo que evita su intromisi√≥n en las frecuencias medias   frecuencias medias neutrales que hacen que voces femeninas masculinas suenen naturales bien articuladas entre s√≠ con otros instrumentos   agudos muy elevados que pueden ser sibilantes en cualquier momento  obstante  brindan gran claridad   gran extensi√≥n en las frecuencias altas dando esa sensaci√≥n de ‚Äú aire ‚Äù que abre da un sentido de espaciosidad en la m√∫sica   descripci√≥n subjetiva del sonido https

demasiado  si hay una buena cantidad de graves teniendo un impacto marcado en sonidos como el bombo de bater√≠a en las bases de canciones de g√©nero edm  en ‚Äú vivere ‚Äù en particular se escuchan con claridad la gran cantidad de instrumentos de la canci√≥n  destac√°ndose  en mi experiencia  un bajo  instrumento  muy placentero que siempre est√° presente por detr√°s de las voces sin entrometerse con su registro  ‚Äú 7th dimension ‚Äù  koan sound  presenta buen ‚Äú rumble ‚Äù de los graves  la buena cantidad calidad de graves resalta la m√∫sica de tipo electr√≥nica d√°ndole un

‚Äú black magic ‚Äù  slayer en vivo   los platillos del comienzo de la canci√≥n son punzantes vol√∫menes medios altos  el cantante principal tiene un buen enfoque sonando claro prominente  ‚Äú retreat

adele  tienen un car√°cter exagerado    espacialidad del sonido  soundstage  e imagen   al ser auriculares semiabiertos permiten una mejor espacialidad que iems auriculares cerrados  su soundstage es gigante pero si se extiende un poco por los alrededores de la cabeza  m√°s ancho que alto  pero con buena profundidad  por el precio es incre√≠ble la imagen separaci√≥n que ofrecen los 668b  con claridad se diferencian instrumentos entre s√≠  de qu√© lado est√°n la distancia entre ellos en el escenario  tambi√©n hay una excelente articulaci√≥n entre voces e instrumentos  siempre testeo estos dos √≠tems con rime ancient mariner  live long beach arena   es espectacular en el minuto 120 c√≥mo pod√©s darte cuenta con estos auriculares que el bajista una de las dos guitarras est√°n la derecha del cantante la otra est√° un poco su izquierda  logro captar este detalle siempre los superlux sorprendieron para bien  tambi√©n en ‚Äú hydrogen ‚Äù  moon   es una canci√≥n donde el movimiento de izquierda derecha de los graves es excelente  recorre las tres posiciones importantes como debe ser  izquierda ‚Äì centro ‚Äì derecha     acotaci√≥n personal   su car√°cter altamente resolutivo lo puede volver fatigante vol√∫menes m√°s altos de lo habitual para g√©neros que tienen muchos instrumentos de cuerda  heavy metalrock m√∫sica cl√°sica con violines    conclusi√≥n al principio de esta rese√±a puede sonar como que estos auriculares tienen m√°s contras que ventajas  fin de cuentas  como alguien que informa sobre productos de audio tengo que ser lo m√°s objetivo posible  si  su confort va dejar que desear para algunos individuos  lo menciono en la rese√±a pero es mi caso   dejando de lado ese aspecto  la relaci√≥n preciocalidad que ofrecen los 668b es de lo mejor que se puede encontrar para auriculares ear por debajo de los  50 usd   25000 pesos argentinos   una resoluci√≥n espectacular  graves con punch pero bien controlados  voces e instrumentos con sonido org√°nico  si le tienen miedo las frecuencias agudas escuchan vol√∫menes bajos normales estos superlux tienen 100  mi recomendaci√≥n para personas con bajo presupuesto 
entiendo un pingo pero se que sabes un monton te esforzaste mucho para la rese√±a  tome su upvote buen hombre
tengo los mismos  te recomiendo cambiarle los earpads por unos mas grandes se vuelven super c√≥modos  en aliexpress hay varias opciones  ademas si queres un sonido un poco mas abierto le podes sacar la tela que tienen atras de los drivers
como siempre  pueden encontrar el resto de mis rese√±as  ac√°   https  kothicreviewswordpresscom   gracias por leer 
yo compr√© los superlux hd681 evo  mis primeros auriculares  entiendo una goma pero mi coparon  adem√°s de ser relativamente baratos   aunque son los mismos pero creo que son similares  coincido con lo de la incomodidad  aprieta la tira de la cabeza aprietan una bocha las orejas los auriculares  agradezco que vinieron las almohadillas de cuero de tela porque las de cuero son horribles  transpiras una bocha  las us√© nunca  el cable ten√≠a pensado desenchufarlo para guardar los auriculares cuando los usaba  pero se siente tan fr√°gil que prefer√≠ dejarlos enchufados 24x7  aprovecho para preguntar  que buscar por internet de este tema cuesta una bocha  ¬øqu√© auriculares podr√≠as recomendar que sean overear  in√°lambricos un poco m√°s c√≥modos que estos superlux 
 removed 
nice review  encanta como suenan este tipo de auris pero soy muy lloron con el tema de la comodidad  ahora uso solamente inears los parlantes 
tengo los superlux 681  los que tienen acentos rojos  la calidad de sonido parece espectacular suficientemente plana  siendo capaces de bajos potentes  sirven muy bien para hacer musica  lo unico que deja que desear es la calidad de construcci√≥n en la conexi√≥n del cable  que si pueden cambiar√≠a por uno reforzado a√±adiria silicona algo dentro de la misma al abrir la tapita  ya que al pasar el tiempo se afloja emepieza tener juego  lo cual hace que se entrecorte el audio de un lado tengas que moverlo engancharle la vuelta  abrirlo volver soldarlo bien 
hola que tal  te quer√≠a consultar algo sobre este auricular el kz zsn pro que le hiciste una rese√±a igual por aqu√≠  estoy entre comprarme uno de estos dos  los necesito para uso general  escuchar m√∫sica  jugar  etc  tambi√©n para producci√≥n  mezcla  mastering  etc   cual crees que tenga la respuesta m√°s plana tenga las caracter√≠sticas adecuadas para el uso que le voy dar   en mis opciones est√° el inear tambi√©n por un tema de comodidad  pero estoy abierto otras recomendaciones  gracias por las rese√±as 
pocas cosas odiado mas que los agudos garchandome los oidos al punto donde casi se distorsionan  hasta ahora tenido mejores que los sony wh1000xm3
gracias  si te interesa hay varios foros en ingl√©s donde se puede aprender sobre los diferentes t√©rminos en relaci√≥n al sonido  te recomiendo  diy audio heaven   https  diyaudioheavenwordpresscomtutorialshowtointerpretgraphsfrequencyresponse   explica las diferentes frecuencias del sonido los t√©rminos  un saludo gracias por el upvote 
buenas tardes  gracias por las recomendaciones  tal vez en un futuro le cambie los pads pero como dije en la conclusi√≥n  el tema del confort afecta mucho mi en particular jaja  voy tener en cuenta lo de sacarle la tela si es muy complicado  muchas gracias 
buenas tardes  c√≥mo est√°s  si los 681 son bastante copados un poco m√°s c√≥modos que los 668b  el cable nunca dio problemas  tampoco los ando desconectando seguido la verdad jajaj   ¬øqu√© auriculares podr√≠as recomendar que sean overear  in√°lambricos un poco m√°s c√≥modos que estos superlux  tengo experiencia con auriculares inal√°mbricos ear personalmente  seg√∫n lo que investigu√©  una buena opci√≥n pueden ser los jbl tune 710bt si lo que necesitas son unos auriculares para ir por la calle  si tienen que ser inal√°mbricos via 24ghz como las ofertas de logitech hyperx tengo ninguna recomendaci√≥n actual que tenga un precio similar los superlux 668b  mil disculpas 
hey  surprise find english speaking member argaming  thanks compliments  try keep reviews objective possible  least items objective haha      https  wwwheadfiorgmemberskothic571864  showcasereviews  reviews head fi written english prefer reading language  hopefully like 668b  nice day 
que tal  muchas gracias  se pueden encontrar auriculares de tipo ear muy c√≥modos  una de mis recomendaciones es la l√≠nea hd 558559598599 de sennheiser  tengo los primeros  558  que fue el segundo modelo de auriculares ear  buenos  que compr√© las almohadillas de terciopelo cuando est√°n nuevas son lo m√°s c√≥modo que existe  tan recomendables para el verano porque son calurosas   obviamente esta l√≠nea te va brindar la aislaci√≥n que si te ofrece un ear ya que son auriculares abiertos  dejan salir entrar los sonidos  pero si proveen un mejor sentido de espaciosidad en la m√∫sica  gracias por tu comentario ojal√° en un futuro encuentres unos ear que te sean c√≥modos  
buenos d√≠as  que l√°stima que tu par haya sufrido tantos problemas de construcci√≥n  como le dec√≠a otro usuario  yo en particular sufr√≠ problemas con el cable su conexi√≥n pero ando desconectando la entrada de 35mm seguido as√≠ que eso puede tener algo que ver  alegro que igualmente te ofrezcan una gran calidad de sonido por el precio los puedas ir arreglando pesar de esa falla  muchas gracias por tu comentario  un saludo 
hola  buenas tardes  te corrijo  la otra rese√±a es del modelo kz dq6  para producci√≥n parece que para voces e instrumentos  que la mayor√≠a se encuentran en las frecuencias medias  te recomendar√≠a los superlux  sin embargo  si los vas tener puestos todo el d√≠a necesitas la aislacion  los dq6 son una mala opci√≥n al ser m√°s c√≥modos que los anteriores  ambos tienen una elevaci√≥n en los graves que hace que sus firmas sean 100  neutrales como si lo es la de un hd 600 pero creo que son de lo mejor que te podes encontrar en ese rango de precio  saltando en el rango de precio  los m40x de audio technica son bastante buenos para masterizar seg√∫n entiendo   edit  fije el precio de los m40x  dudo que sean 4 veces mejores para justificar pagar 80k  ojal√° te sirva  un saludo 
tambien tienen un leve efecto en el sonido  cambia entre unas de tela unas de cuero  tambien tengo unas que son con  cooling gel  similar la espuma con memoria que viene en almohadas  las recomiendo 
el problema ser√≠a en la conexi√≥n del cable el auricular en s√≠  esta parece tener problemas ya que pas√≥ en mis dos pares  pero con un poco de ma√±a se arregla puede quedar mas fuerte  la calidad de sonido es mucho mejor de lo que esperaba igualmente asi que al menos al precio que estaba en su momento vali√≥ la pena  se ahora que precio estar√°n los superlux  saludos gracias por tu contribuci√≥n tambi√©n  est√° bueno ver reviews de cosas que podemos conaeguir ac√°  especialmente tan detalladas 
perd√≥n por la equivocaci√≥n sobre la review  le√≠ muy mal jajaja  muchas gracias por la respuesta  voy estar chequeando seg√∫n todo lo que dec√≠s
jajaj  pasa nada  solo lo correg√≠ para que busques el modelo incorrecto  hay de qu√©  espero que encuentres unos auris que te sirvan  si necesitas que sea nuevono te molesta comprar usado veces se ven buenas ofertas por auriculares usados de marcas como akg  sennheiser audio technica  saludos 
que usan como sistema de audio  recomiendan alg√∫n home theater
buenas  estoy buscando un sistema de audio para poner en la compu  seria para el living as√≠ que estaba pensando en alg√∫n 51 pero literalmente hay ning√∫n sistema de audio 51 en argentina  es trist√≠simo  estaba viendo si conven√≠a comprar en tiendamia pero nunca compre por ah√≠  asi que les quer√≠a preguntar que sistema usan ustedes si compraron algo por tiendamia  como es el proceso   el √∫nico que encontr√©   https  wwwmercadolibrecomarhometheaterlogitechz607negro110v220vpmla15479298  searchvariationmla15479298  position1  searchlayoutstack  typeproduct  trackingid9080438e824c4aa0a0bd83ba8f074993  gracias 
yo siempre us√© auriculares  nunca gust√≥ que los dem√°s escuchen lo que yo  pero antes que ese 51 de logitech que and√° saber como suena  pondr√≠a  estos de edifier   https  articulomercadolibrecomarmla924968090parlantesedifierr1280tbafle2042wrmsbandejasmarttvjm  position34  searchlayoutstack  typeitem  trackingid541a071efc324f0eb859ee9c8608bd20   aunque es un 51 son parlantes con medios  graves tweeter separados  tienen buen sonido buen volumen   es una marca muy reconocida por su excelente calidad  la vista se que son mejores que los parlantes que trae esos logitech  adem√°s esos logitech parecen de pl√°stico  estoy seguro  pero el pl√°stico tiene la misma ac√∫stica que la madera  siempre un parlante con buena madera con buena c√°mara ac√∫stica va sonar much√≠simo mejor que cualquier pl√°stico  si realmente necesitas un 51  fijate que hay gente que vende 51 edifier usados al mismo precio que esos logitech  en mercadoreddit hace poco uno hab√≠a publicado de esos 
recomendaci√≥n personal  and√° por un 21 copado  un 51 el 51 va salir m√°s caro de entrada si te gast√°s esa misma plata en un 21 te pod√©s comprar algo que puede tener mejor calidad  es una regla  obviamente   yo tengo unos edifier r1700bt  suenan perfectos  soy bastante quisquilloso con eso  vas tener problemas de vol√∫men menos que vivas en un galp√≥n 
es al pedo  a√∫n teniendo parlantes logitech sony  los edifier tienen una calidad de sonido superior  por como est√°n de rid√≠culamente caros todos los parlantes recomiendo edifier usado  si te das ma√±a los desarmas limpias  agreg√°ndoles un bluetooth interno externo los dejas full full 
casi siempre uso auris porque es m√°s inmersivo para m√≠  pod√©s poner el volumen fuerte que nadie se va quejar  tambi√©n probe el home theater pero ocupaba m√°s espacio que otra cosa termine consiguiendo unos parlantes edifier que la verdad si quiero pongo ah√≠ el audio saco las ganas  menos espacio gusta porque tienen bluetooth 
1080av  vas tener que dejar una buena cantidad de guita  pero como haber  hay  el buen audio es caro  el 51 con la cantidad de parlantes que necesitas es todav√≠a m√°s
los parlantes que vinieron con mi primer compu hace 16 a√±os
soy mucho de parlante yo  los uso para todo por eso quer√≠a ver alguno maso menos bueno pero es incre√≠ble como hay nada  yo para la compu uso unos edifer se la bancan as√≠ que quiz√° termine comprando algo as√≠  gracias por la recomendaci√≥n  voy ir viendo mercadoreddit ver si encuentro alguno 
si  parece que voy tener que hacer esa quiera  esos son 20 
si  uno dijo lo mismo que compre unos edifier 21  que ya uso para la pc la verdad que est√°n buenos  viendo que tampoco es que tenga muchas opciones seguro tiro por esa  pregunta  como seria eso de agregarles bluetooth interno externo  como con la pc  con un especie de pendrive 
s√©  veo muchas opciones yo  m√°s de 45  recomendas alguno 
si  √∫ltimamente hay casi variedad de productos  yo con los auriculares sufro al ver c√≥mo en el mundo hay much√≠simas marcas buen√≠simas baratas como hifiman moondrop ac√° nunca llegan  e importarlos es un dolor de cabeza  cada a√±o es menor la cantidad de opciones 
s√≠  se torci√≥ el cerebro  quise decir 20 todo el tiempo  quiero vacaciones
